If I switch my phone to English it all works.\n\nIt’s just such a slap in the face not getting ANYTHING of what was promised.

    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

Staying healthy was becoming a second full-time job.\n\n**👉 So I built** [**Nori**](https://nori.ai)**.**\n\nNori is an AI health coach that connects all your health data (Apple Health, Oura, Whoop, Garmin, labs, whatever) and tells you what to actually do to get healthier.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Syncs all your wearables and health apps automatically\n* AI analyzes patterns across sleep, workouts, nutrition, biomarkers\n* Gives you personalized daily insights and recommendations\n* One conversation interface instead of 5+ apps\n\n**Real examples from my own data:**\n\n* I got stronger when I *added* rest days instead of grinding 6-7 workouts weekly\n* Magnesium at bedtime increased my REM sleep by 25%\n* When I miss a workout, it tells me exactly how to adjust\n\n**🙌 Giving away 25 free invites to readers of** r/apple **so you can try the app**.  \n**🍎 Use invite code APPLE.** \n\nI'm especially looking for Apple Watch users focused on weight loss, energy, or recovery.\n\nIf you try it, I'd love feedback—and an App Store review would mean a lot to me 🙏\n\n**App store link:** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nori-ai-own-your-health/id6746278715](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nori-ai-own-your-health/id6746278715)  \n**🍎 First 25 to try it - use invite code APPLE.**  (Update: this should work now, sorry!)\n\n**Website:** [https://nori.ai](https://nori.ai)\n\nThanks so much—really looking forward to hearing what you think!  \nDave",

If I switch my phone to English it all works.\n\nIt’s just such a slap in the face not getting ANYTHING of what was promised. And you can’t say ”Soon” for over a year…\n\nJesus… I’ve used Apple products since -94, I just want what was promised.",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

    "selftext": "Hello dear iPhone users. I am in search of a new iPhone, and I was looking for a new iPhone 16. I live in Italy, so labels on this devices contains Italian texts on them. However, on Subito (a platform like ebay/vinted), one seller is selling a device that he is claiming new, but the label suggests that this device is made for Indian market. I don't think that it is a genuine Apple product. Also, when I checl the coverage on Apple website, item picture appears to be an iPhone 16 Pro. Lots of inconsistencies here. Has anyone ever seen something like this? Can you guys please check this?",

    "selftext": "Here is a list of the advantages by going with either model. Maybe you are looking at either a refurbished 16 Pro or a new 17, maybe this will help.\n\n**16 Pro:**\n\n* 5x Telephoto camera\n* Pro formats such as ProRes, Log, RAW etc... (Very useful if you are deep into editing videos/photos)\n* Main camera has a much larger sensor (better for low light, more dynamic range, shallower depth of field, less noise)\n* LiDAR (useful for AR, 3D stuff, low light photography)\n* USB 3 (Much faster wired data transfers)\n* Titanium frame (Feels more solid, metallic and premium compared to aluminium)\n* Record up to 4k 120 fps (120 fps is useful, because you can slow it down in editing to a lower fps, giving you a really nice slow motion shot)\n* Second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization for video \n* Studio quality microphones\n* Better speakers? (I was unable to confirm this one)\n\n  \n\n\n**Base 17:**\n\n* Ceramic Shield 2 front glass (More durable, significantly more scratch resistant)\n* ≈ 10% faster CPU\n* ≈ 15% faster GPU\n* The new Neural Accelerators are the real deal, dramatic speed improvements when running local AI models, but with only 8gb RAM I'm not sure how useful this will be. \n* 256gb base storage\n* Slightly longer battery life \n* Much improved front facing camera with Center Stage\n* Much higher outdoor screen brightness\n* Lighter (177 grams)\n* Bluetooth 6\n* \\+ 1 year of software support (If Apple keeps up the current trend)\n* Anti-reflective coating (Reduces glare for better outdoor visibility)\n* Faster charging\n\n  \n\n\n**So, which one did i pick for myself?**\n\nI managed to get a deal on a \"refurbished\" 16 Pro 256gb in brand new condition for $100 cheaper than a new 17.\n\nI picked it over the 17 because I'm deep into photography and i wanted the better camera system (17 Pro was out of my budget). But if I wasn't into photography then I would've picked the 17.",

I haven't found a case with a large enough (or correctly positioned) metal plat/magcharge to hold. \n\nAnyone have recommendations on a case that will meet my needs?

    "title": "Loving my new 17PM in Cosmic Orange",
    "selftext": "I’ve been an iPhone user since iPhone 3G days. Had a few Samsung phones a few times in between due to temptations but always found myself back to iPhone. \n\nI am writing this post about the color choices this year because there is no black option. I’ve always went with black or space grey in that matter. I think my 4S and 12 Pro Max were white and pacific blue (wanted the graphite but the seller didn’t have it) and besides these two, all of them were either space grey or black. \n\nIt was very surprising to see a lack of black option in this year’s line up. So when I was thinking about my choices, I thought maybe silver might be the way to go but my wife called dibs on silver and I didn’t want to have the same color as her phone. That left me with the cosmic orange and deep blue and I know deep blue was the logical choice since I preferred darker phones. However, I just wasn’t feeling it. So I decided to gamble and go with the loud cosmic orange. I am not going to lie, I have thought about changing the color to deep blue quite a few times when I was waiting for my phone to arrive. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the cosmic orange color upon my phone’s arrival and had it for 10 days now. I am using it with a clear case and it has grown on me so much. I am actually glad that I went with the orange phone this year. \n\n1. Feels like a new phone. Might have felt a bit more familiar with my old phone (16PM) if I went with deep blue. \n\n2. The color is actually quite nice. I personally really like it. The whole post is about this, I know. \n\n3. If you are on the fence of choosing, I encourage everyone to go with orange this year as I think this is the most exciting color in the line up. \n\nSilver is a pretty solid choice and if you have other apple devices in silver then silver should be no brainer. Vice versa, deep blue is similar to midnight in my opinion. \n\nHowever, if you want one of your apple devices to really pop from your range of devices, orange won’t disappoint you!",

There’s an official Apple document showing the exchange, and it clearly says it’s a new device.\nWhat confuses me is that the replacement invoice lists a price of €809, which seems quite low .. around €200 less than what this model usually costs. The seller is asking for roughly the same amount as shown on the document.\nIs that normal for Apple replacement devices, or does it sound suspicious?\nI‘m based in Germany.",

If not does anyone have recommendations for what website/company to use for it? \nThird, would I have to buy eSIMs specifically for the country I’m going to? Would I have to buy it there? Or would that be something to select when I’m buying one? \n\nI’m really not a tech guy and am feeling lost, can anyone help?",

Any case you get (at least semi-transparent ones) start to come apart at the seems very quickly. After 4 cases this has happened each time, sometimes within a day of use and sometimes after a couple months. Google and you will find it’s a common problem. The plastic bordering the camera that has their own logo on it also cracks very quickly. Ten day return window should have been a red flag to me. If you ask for a warranty replacement they will honor it ONCE but will not warranty that replacement case even if it starts to fall apart 3 days later. If you push back on this they’ll send you another replacement but won’t give you a refund, which doesn’t help since it’s a recurring quality problem. Super disappointed since they have cute designs and they’re expensive af. Better off getting a brand like Speck and putting stickers on it. I’ve had $10 Amazon cases last far, far longer. You also have to EMAIL them in order to leave a review on their website, which explains how they have no 1 star reviews on their site. Very misleading. ",

The Sleep Focus feature is highlighted as an intentional design choice for silent, haptic alarms on the watch.\n* **iOS Features Causing Muting:** Discusses features like \"Attention Aware Features\" which can incorrectly lower alarm volumes, and \"Focus Modes\" which can inadvertently block time-sensitive notifications if not configured correctly. Lesser-known mechanisms like \"Cover to Mute\" on the Apple Watch and the \"Change with Buttons\" setting are also mentioned as potential culprits.\n* **Documented Bugs and User Complaints:** Confirms that silent alarms are a widespread and recurring issue, often appearing after iOS updates. Specific bugs like the \"sticky\" Silent switch and the \"None\" sound default bug are detailed.\n* **Connectivity Conundrums:** Explores how Bluetooth audio routing can hijack alarm sounds to connected devices, even if they are off or in standby. The Windows Phone Link integration is also considered a potential source of conflict.\n* **Comprehensive Action Plan:** Offers a tiered troubleshooting protocol, starting with least disruptive configuration changes (Tier 1), moving to systematic state resets (Tier 2), and finally to a \"clean slate\" factory reset (Tier 3) if all else fails.",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

It has that premium stainless steel frame and just the right weight. Feels way more “handy” than most modern phones that are huge and clunky.\n\nPerformance-wise, it’s still fast enough for almost everything, and the camera holds up really well for normal use. The OLED display still looks beautiful too. I genuinely think the XS was one of Apple’s best-designed iPhones — elegant, powerful, and just the right size.",

Any case you get (at least semi-transparent ones) start to come apart at the seems very quickly. After 4 cases this has happened each time, sometimes within a day of use and sometimes after a couple months. Google and you will find it’s a common problem. The plastic bordering the camera that has their own logo on it also cracks very quickly. Ten day return window should have been a red flag to me. If you ask for a warranty replacement they will honor it ONCE but will not warranty that replacement case even if it starts to fall apart 3 days later. If you push back on this they’ll send you another replacement but won’t give you a refund, which doesn’t help since it’s a recurring quality problem. Super disappointed since they have cute designs and they’re expensive af. Better off getting a brand like Speck and putting stickers on it. I’ve had $10 Amazon cases last far, far longer. You also have to EMAIL them in order to leave a review on their website, which explains how they have no 1 star reviews on their site. Very misleading. ",

    "title": "Some Facts, Rumors and speculation regarding Enhanced satellite connectivity.",
    "selftext": "So I’m sure I’m not the only who seen the rumors regarding the enhanced satellite features for the next generation of Pro model iPhones such as the 18 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nAnd I’m sure I’m not the only one who felt a little left out after one bought the latest 17 Pro after reading said rumors?\n\nBut I will both speculate and drop some facts I found regarding if the current models and past ones will get this enhanced satellite connectivity, if it’s natively supported or if there is a workaround.\n\nSo to give a better idea on what the IPhones will require for this enhanced connectivity is a feature called:\n\n5G NTN\n\n5G NTN or ”Non Terrestrial Networks” is a feature set that includes added hardware for timing and Doppler shift compensation to handle fast moving low orbit satellites, and the hardware required to not only lock on reliably, but also seamlessly.\n\nQualcomm has released multiple videos explaining what and how 5G NTN works and their capabilities, here is one such example:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wGV5PA15kFg?si=MFu_CV4EF1VFw6-8\n\n5G NTN would allow a user to be able to seamlessly switch between a TN(Terrestrial Network) and an NTN(Non terrestrial Network) without loss of data or live connection such as a video call.\n\nA NTN network is designed and meant to provide coverage with the use of aerial assets or space based assets such as UAVs, Aircraft’s, Balloons and satellites.\n\nThe current min - max speeds for an NTN connection one could realistically expect under normal conditions is around 1-10 mbit/s download and about 0.5 - 2 mbit/s upload(for satellite based NTN).\n\nDue note that this is speculation on my part as the sources I found have varying opinions so this is my realistic expectation.\n\nBut now, onto the IPhones at hand.\n\nTo be Brief:\n\nthe current IPhone 17 PRO models and the regular iPhone 17 support 5G NTN due to them being equipped with the Snapdragon X80 modem, which is fully certified according to the criteria set by 3GPP to handle the full feature set of 5G NTN and 5G NB-NTN connectivity, this is supported by Qualcomms own documentation.\n\nThis means in short the current IPhone 17 and 17 Pro models have the hardware necessary for enhanced satellite connectivity.\n\nThis also means the IPhone Air does not support enhanced satellite connectivity, unless proven otherwise. Currently there is no available documentation that confirms the C1X modems has NTN support…\n\nSo the current limitation with the regular models and Pro models is software.\n\nThis also means that the next generation of IPhone 18 pros will most likely carry the same features, although it’s possible with added hardware to further enhance the connectivity such as better antennas.\n\n5G NTN is not supported on older models based on the documentation I could find online, so users with an IPhone 16 Pro and older unfortunately lack this hardware.\n\nHowever, we’ve seen that NTN might not be necessary, as proven by SpaceX and their current generation of 4G enabled Direct to Cell Starlink constellation. However some users have reported a lag or disconnect when switching between ground based and space based connectivity.\n\nSo to wrap this up:\n\n5G NTN is fully supported on the Snapdragon X80 Cellular modem, found in the IPhone 17 and IPhone 17  Pro models(Hardware vise)\n\niPhone Air lacks the necessary hardware for NTN.\n\nExpected min-max speed is 1-10 Mbit/s down, 0.5-2 Mbit/s up.\n\nCurrently no software integration on current iOS versions, support added at a later time hopefully.\n\nSpaceX 2nd Generation Direct to Cell(5G), AST Spacemobile and Skylo are NTN enabled.\n\n5G NTN uses the n252 - n256 bands, no extra hardware required, dedicated bands for satellite connectivity(MSS).\n\nThat’s it for me, enjoy I gueS",

    "selftext": "Hello dear iPhone users. I am in search of a new iPhone, and I was looking for a new iPhone 16. I live in Italy, so labels on this devices contains Italian texts on them. However, on Subito (a platform like ebay/vinted), one seller is selling a device that he is claiming new, but the label suggests that this device is made for Indian market. I don't think that it is a genuine Apple product. Also, when I checl the coverage on Apple website, item picture appears to be an iPhone 16 Pro. Lots of inconsistencies here. Has anyone ever seen something like this? Can you guys please check this?",

    "title": "iPhone Pro – My experience with RAW, ProRAW, and third-party camera apps",
    "selftext": "I recently bought an iPhone 17 Pro and wanted to better understand how photography works on it—especially when it comes to formats like RAW, ProRAW, and HEIC. Alongside the native Camera app, I tested three of the most popular third-party apps: **Halide**, **Lightroom**, and **Indigo Project**. Here’s a summary of my findings. Feel free to correct me if I’ve misunderstood anything.\n\n# Photo Formats on iPhone\n\nThere are essentially three types of photo formats available:\n\n**1. Processed (HEIC / JPEG)**\n\nThis is the default format, and it takes full advantage of Apple’s computational photography. Images are typically captured at up to 48 megapixels on the iPhone 17 Pro. These files go through Apple’s pipeline—noise reduction, dynamic range optimization, and other adjustments, the details of which are proprietary. This format serves as the baseline for comparing the others.\n\n**2. ProRAW**\n\nThis format can be seen as a hybrid: it’s not fully unprocessed, but it offers significantly more editing latitude than HEIC or JPEG. You can adjust white balance, exposure, and other parameters. However, it still benefits from some of Apple’s processing, such as image fusion and noise reduction. ProRAW is available in both 12MP and 48MP.\n\n**3. Unprocessed RAW**\n\nThis is the purest form of sensor data, with no processing at all. It’s not available through the native Camera app but can be accessed via third-party apps like Halide. This format theoretically gives you full control—but at a cost.\n\n# Third-Party Apps: What Do They Actually Add?\n\n# Halide\n\nHalide supports all three formats: processed, ProRAW, and unprocessed RAW. Compared to Apple’s Camera app, it provides more control, such as manual adjustment of white balance, focus area, shutter speed, and ISO.\n\nThat said, there are some limitations.\n\nI didn’t dive deeply into the HEIC/JPEG options, since I’m not particularly interested in those. I assume the results are similar to Apple’s, with the welcome addition of choosing between 12MP and 48MP outputs.\n\nProRAW capture works much like it does in the native app—same resolutions, similar image quality. The added benefit with Halide is manual control over white balance and focus. However, the moment you take manual control over exposure settings (shutter speed and ISO), the output drops to 12MP. That’s disappointing, and for me, almost a deal breaker.\n\nAs for unprocessed RAW, it may seem ideal in theory—no image fusion, no artificial HDR, no noise reduction—but you’re once again limited to 12MP. And that’s where you realize just how dependent mobile sensors are on computational processing. Without it, and at just 12MP, the results aren’t particularly impressive.\n\n# Lightroom\n\nLightroom offers its own RAW capture system, separate from both Apple’s and Halide’s. I started running some tests, but quickly stopped when I saw that RAW files were also limited to 12MP. That made it irrelevant for my use case.\n\n# Indigo Project\n\nThis app has been marketed as a major advancement in smartphone computational photography. But again, RAW files are captured at only 12MP, meaning all processing and edits are constrained by that resolution. For me, that makes it a non-starter as well.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nIn the end, switching to a third-party app for photography on the iPhone has fairly limited benefits.\n\nIf you want a cleaner, less processed alternative to ProRAW, you’re stuck with 12MP files. That alone significantly reduces the appeal. The only real advantage to using apps like Halide is being able to shoot ProRAW while gaining access to extra tools—manual focus, white balance control, exposure settings, histograms, etc.\n\nBut considering that Halide is subscription-based, it raises the question of whether the additional features are worth the cost—especially when the core image quality remains so closely tied to Apple’s processing.",

Any case you get (at least semi-transparent ones) start to come apart at the seems very quickly. After 4 cases this has happened each time, sometimes within a day of use and sometimes after a couple months. Google and you will find it’s a common problem. The plastic bordering the camera that has their own logo on it also cracks very quickly. Ten day return window should have been a red flag to me. If you ask for a warranty replacement they will honor it ONCE but will not warranty that replacement case even if it starts to fall apart 3 days later. If you push back on this they’ll send you another replacement but won’t give you a refund, which doesn’t help since it’s a recurring quality problem. Super disappointed since they have cute designs and they’re expensive af. Better off getting a brand like Speck and putting stickers on it. I’ve had $10 Amazon cases last far, far longer. You also have to EMAIL them in order to leave a review on their website, which explains how they have no 1 star reviews on their site. Very misleading. ",

    "title": "Some Facts, Rumors and speculation regarding Enhanced satellite connectivity.",
    "selftext": "So I’m sure I’m not the only who seen the rumors regarding the enhanced satellite features for the next generation of Pro model iPhones such as the 18 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nAnd I’m sure I’m not the only one who felt a little left out after one bought the latest 17 Pro after reading said rumors?\n\nBut I will both speculate and drop some facts I found regarding if the current models and past ones will get this enhanced satellite connectivity, if it’s natively supported or if there is a workaround.\n\nSo to give a better idea on what the IPhones will require for this enhanced connectivity is a feature called:\n\n5G NTN\n\n5G NTN or ”Non Terrestrial Networks” is a feature set that includes added hardware for timing and Doppler shift compensation to handle fast moving low orbit satellites, and the hardware required to not only lock on reliably, but also seamlessly.\n\nQualcomm has released multiple videos explaining what and how 5G NTN works and their capabilities, here is one such example:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wGV5PA15kFg?si=MFu_CV4EF1VFw6-8\n\n5G NTN would allow a user to be able to seamlessly switch between a TN(Terrestrial Network) and an NTN(Non terrestrial Network) without loss of data or live connection such as a video call.\n\nA NTN network is designed and meant to provide coverage with the use of aerial assets or space based assets such as UAVs, Aircraft’s, Balloons and satellites.\n\nThe current min - max speeds for an NTN connection one could realistically expect under normal conditions is around 1-10 mbit/s download and about 0.5 - 2 mbit/s upload(for satellite based NTN).\n\nDue note that this is speculation on my part as the sources I found have varying opinions so this is my realistic expectation.\n\nBut now, onto the IPhones at hand.\n\nTo be Brief:\n\nthe current IPhone 17 PRO models and the regular iPhone 17 support 5G NTN due to them being equipped with the Snapdragon X80 modem, which is fully certified according to the criteria set by 3GPP to handle the full feature set of 5G NTN and 5G NB-NTN connectivity, this is supported by Qualcomms own documentation.\n\nThis means in short the current IPhone 17 and 17 Pro models have the hardware necessary for enhanced satellite connectivity.\n\nThis also means the IPhone Air does not support enhanced satellite connectivity, unless proven otherwise. Currently there is no available documentation that confirms the C1X modems has NTN support…\n\nSo the current limitation with the regular models and Pro models is software.\n\nThis also means that the next generation of IPhone 18 pros will most likely carry the same features, although it’s possible with added hardware to further enhance the connectivity such as better antennas.\n\n5G NTN is not supported on older models based on the documentation I could find online, so users with an IPhone 16 Pro and older unfortunately lack this hardware.\n\nHowever, we’ve seen that NTN might not be necessary, as proven by SpaceX and their current generation of 4G enabled Direct to Cell Starlink constellation. However some users have reported a lag or disconnect when switching between ground based and space based connectivity.\n\nSo to wrap this up:\n\n5G NTN is fully supported on the Snapdragon X80 Cellular modem, found in the IPhone 17 and IPhone 17  Pro models(Hardware vise)\n\niPhone Air lacks the necessary hardware for NTN.\n\nExpected min-max speed is 1-10 Mbit/s down, 0.5-2 Mbit/s up.\n\nCurrently no software integration on current iOS versions, support added at a later time hopefully.\n\nSpaceX 2nd Generation Direct to Cell(5G), AST Spacemobile and Skylo are NTN enabled.\n\n5G NTN uses the n252 - n256 bands, no extra hardware required, dedicated bands for satellite connectivity(MSS).\n\nThat’s it for me, enjoy I gueS",

However, on Subito (a platform like ebay/vinted), one seller is selling a device that he is claiming new, but the label suggests that this device is made for Indian market. I don't think that it is a genuine Apple product. Also, when I checl the coverage on Apple website, item picture appears to be an iPhone 16 Pro. Lots of inconsistencies here. Has anyone ever seen something like this? Can you guys please check this?",

I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

(It's basically Google Files). Then I tried to switch back to my backup account on my phone, lo and behold the discovery: the backup got switched off when I switched to usiage without an account, and when I went back to my backup account, it started backup FRESH (ie started backing up everything on my phone again ~70GB/11000 files).\n\nI panicked and thought I lost everything, checked photos.google.com and thankfully my files, albums and face menu were all intact and already backed up. A sigh of relief indeed.\n\nAnd then I may have done a blunder, by clearing all the app data of Google photos on my phone seeing if it'll reset google photos as I thought it's just a glitch and anyways everything is backed up.... But it's not a glitch and if I turn the backup back on, google will backup everything in my device again and might create a duplicate of everything on my account.... Tried backup with the settings menu too, everything has the same issue like this..... \n\n⭐Would LOVE to know any solutions to this.... Thanks!\n\nTLDR:\nDo NOT touch \"USE WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT\" on Google Photos if you don't want to backup everything on your phone from the beginning again.",

Despite being more expensive, I prefer to use the accessories from Google's store because third-party has been such a crapshoot for me in the past...\n\n\\- Case-Mate Lens Protector for Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL camera (has it negatively impacted the image quality of your photos and/or videos?)\n\n\\-ZAGG InvisibleShield® Glass Elite for Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL (does it have the big hole where the thumbprint verify would be, which makes watching YouTube videos obnoxious? I looked at the product photos and it doesn't appear to have the thumbprint hole, but I've still been burned in the past by incorrect product photos when I tried to buy a replacement screen protector for my 6 Pro) \\*unfortunately the cheaper screen protector provided by Case-Mate is currently out of stock and I have no idea when or if it'll come back\n\n\\-Pixelsnap Charger with Stand (this is the big one; my main issue is that my previous Pixel Stand Charger that I used with the 6 Pro is very slow to charge my new 10 Pro XL because I guess they changed how the charging works)\n\n\\-finally, what Pixelsnap compatible case are you using? There's quite a few options and it's kind of overwhelming because there doesn't seem to be any reviews displayed for any of these accessories. Ideally I'd like one that protrudes out enough to protect the cameras on the back of the phone so I can maybe skip on buying a glass screen protector for the cameras, but it's difficult for me to tell if any of the cases are like that.\n\nIt's fine if you don't have the XL specifically, but have the regular 10 or the 10 Pro. And it's fine if you can only answer some or one of these.",

Straight forward, opens and saves fast.\n\nBut, it's not great. For example. I want to block someone out of the photo (College Lecturer, infront, in the middle of the digital whiteboard), the only way to do that is use the markup pen, with the width of a human hair, to scribble that person out! Which takes forEVER!\n\nWouldn't it be easier if 1) We could change the thickness of the pen. Or 2) Just add a few black boxes over said person. Even a 'Blur' brush, so we could blur that person out.\n\nI'm fully aware of Photoshop Express, Lightroom, Photoshop online (Adobe full package user) etc. But they take time to load up + load / import the image > edit it > save / export it > find which ever folder it's in > Move the image to the DCIM / Camera folder then it's date is different to the rest, so it's not in order... Yea, it's a faff.\n\nSo, @Google (do they even read this forum?), please, could you just add some more basic features to the default Google photo editing app?\n\n* Edit the pen thickness.\n* Add coloured shapes.\n* A blur tool to blur specific parts of an image.\n* Maybe an 'add other image, to the edit' option. Etc\n\nI'm sure Google has a mountain of people it can call upon to do this? Idk. Just a suggestion.\n\nKind regards, Dragonfyr",

    "selftext": "I've been with Pixel quite a while now as I am not a Apple fan and like the camera performance, plus many updates compared to Samsung that basically seemed to want you to buy a new phone regularly so they didn't' update. \n\nCurrently 8 Pro. I'm not a phone expert so help please. \n\nKeyboard - there's a big white space at the bottom unused, but having large hands I'm always hitting a letter instead of space bar which is frustrating as there's free space there. Also, Apple for years has used a sort of zoom feature where the buttons get bigger as you approach them. Is there a solution or preferred keyboard? \n\nFiles - As a political warrior I use Threads / FB / Bluesky, however I'd like to manage my meme files better. Right now these apps default to their own folders. I'd like to be able to reorganize them all into topical folders so I can save time accessing them. Frequently I recall the file meme, but not where it is and have to search multiple locations. I realize much of this is likely app driven, but still would like to be more in control of these files! Suggestions? It would be preferred to have a \"Meme directory\". I have experience with MSDos and windows for years, but Android apps seems locked down and kind of stuck with awkwardness of these defaults. \n\nBluetooth - 1. with so many bluetooth devices nowadays, why the heck does Pixel only show about 3 of the saved ones, requiring another tap to \"see all\" when if they were all listed in the first place I could be there already?  2. I'd LOVE the ability to CONTROL BTooth connections FFS. My backyard has stereo speakers wired to a receiver with a BT add-on, and I ignorantly bought a second one same type for the main sound system. Unless I unplug the unwanted one, my phone will switch between them almost randomly w/o asking. My car uses a BT adapter plugged in and has its own BT circuit. To get the adapter to connect, I seem to have to \"forget\" the car BT and connect to the adapter, but it doesn't do this reliably. I have to keep trying over and over, for some reason it eventually works. The car BT \"asks\" to connect during this time seeming to interfere with my desired connection in the process. Maybe I'm a boomer but BT seems to be designed by sadists as its such a PITA. My phone also is reluctant to BT to my Win11 laptop for some reason as well, but supposed to be easy.  sigh.\n\nUpcoming alarm dismiss - this used to show up on my notification list, after a recent update it doesn't. I've gone through menus looking for a way to go back to having it listed, but to no avail. I take a morning med that has to be 1 hour before eating, and frequently my body wakes up before the alarm, so this is something that I deal with daily. Not huge but a step backwards.  ",

She recently **forgot her screen lock code**, so we had to **factory reset** the phone through recovery mode. Ever since, it’s completely stuck at the **FRP screen** saying:\n\n>\n\nWe *are* signing in with that exact account — the same Gmail she’s always used on this phone. We’ve reset the password, logged in successfully on other devices, even removed the Pixel from “Your Devices” in her Google Account. Still, the phone refuses to accept it and keeps showing that FRP message.\n\nHere’s what we’ve already tried:\n\n* Waited over **three days** after resetting the password (to bypass the 72-hour FRP delay).\n* Removed the device from her Google account and waited again.\n* Double-checked that the email and password are correct (copy/paste).\n* Attempted account recovery just to verify ownership.\n\nWhen trying to recover the account via phone number, the recovery screen even shows a **completely different email** as being linked — which makes zero sense because this number was only added recently and has *never* been tied to another Google account.\n\nSo right now we have a phone that’s totally unusable even though we can log into the correct Google account everywhere else. It feels like the FRP system has just bugged out and won’t recognize the legit owner anymore.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Has anyone else seen FRP get stuck like this after a password reset?\n2. Is there *any* legit way to make Google refresh or re-sync ownership on their side?\n3. Would contacting Google Support with proof of purchase and IMEI actually help?\n4. Any other ideas before this thing becomes an expensive paperweight?\n\nWe don’t want to mess with shady bypass tools — just looking for a proper fix. Any help or firsthand experiences appreciated!",

They are more annoying than deal breakers so as of now I think I would still stick with the pixel 10 pro because of the benefits it has. It would be nice to resolve some of these though.\n\nIssues\n- YouTube sometimes slow . Shorts don't load . This is rare. \n- on screen buttons not registering my touch sometimes. Not sure if it is more sensitive to placement than my prior phone but I have noticed a handful of times in multiple apps that this is the case. YouTube, obsidian , chrome\n- content and sometimes buttons are only partly on the screen in some apps. Maybe this is typical on the smaller devices. The pixel 10 corners also seem more rounded than my s24+\n- obsidian note taking app closes despite me trying every optimization I can find to keep it open. \n- obsidian links do not render as links sometimes in edit mode. They do render if I turn to view mode. Just checked and obsidian on the s24+ doesn't have this issue. \n- swiping doesn't work as consistently. Reddit app, my open app drawer, ect. I have to swipe further across for it to fully switch to the next thing. Just tried on the s24+ end it doesn't have this issue despite being a bigger screen. ",

It recognizes all saved fingerprints, but after ~2 hours it stops recognizing them.\n\nThe sensor area still lights up and reacts, but every touch gives “Fingerprint not recognized.”\n\nRebooting makes it recognize my saved fingerprints again (though Android has to be running for ~10 min first), then ~2 hours later the same issue happens.\nI’ve tried deleting and re-adding fingerprints, it works then but the issue always comes back.\n\nDoes anyone else have the same issue? Has Google acknowledged this as a known bug? Is there any workaround besides rebooting?",

When it's closed or in the background it won't deliver so everything eventually comes through sms/mms.\n\nI wiped her phone which didn't fix it. Reverted back to Android 15 and that still didn't fix the RCS issue. So updated back to 16 and said to disable RCS so she can get texts on time.\n\nNow ever since she got the phone setup from the multiple wipes it will not get notifications at all for multiple apps the major ones for her being Snapchat, Facebook and Ring.\n\nThis is so infuriating.

I tell them that's not acceptable, and SORRY, CHARLIE!  That's all I'm getting. \n\nI can stomach (barely) paying $70 for $1.70 worth of Urethane because I know what design and tooling costs on plastics.

I'm near the end of my contract so might just push through instead of sending it off to get fixed. \n\nMy question is. Do all pixel phones run the risk of this green screen issue? I've seen some mention it being a thing with the 7s. I had a 6 before getting my current 8 and didn't get it on that. Mostly wondering whether to risk getting another pixel phone, don't want to be dealing with this issue again. ",

    "selftext": "There was a post on this topic from a year ago but it's locked and doesn't have any good responses.\n\nI was taking a photo of a shoe with my pixel 7 and one of my friends was in the background. The shoe was \\~5 inches from the phone camera and her face(\\~5 feet away) was completely blurred out due to the bokeh. This was intentional and exactly the effect I wanted. I took the pic and it looked fine so I moved on. 2 days later I went back to look at it, and it has horrifyingly sharpened her face and her features look reminiscent of the old DALL-E mini ai generated images and the picture now has the \"Face Unblur\" tag in google photos. \n\nHow can I remove this or revert it back to what it was? It looks awful and is not at all what I wanted. Additionally, can I turn this feature off? If it's not going to work (I have 100s of blurry photos) then I don't think I want it on.\n\nThank you in advance!",

Google tells me there's nothing they can do beyond this and tell me they're going to replace the phone to solve this issue. Great!  Then I mention there's cosmetic damage on the screen. Nope!!! \"Since the device has some physical damages, this will void the warranty\"\n\nThe cosmetic damage on the screen has nothing to do with my issue, completely unrelated.

(It's basically Google Files). Then I tried to switch back to my backup account on my phone, lo and behold the discovery: the backup got switched off when I switched to usiage without an account, and when I went back to my backup account, it started backup FRESH (ie started backing up everything on my phone again ~70GB/11000 files).\n\nI panicked and thought I lost everything, checked photos.google.com and thankfully my files, albums and face menu were all intact and already backed up. A sigh of relief indeed.\n\nAnd then I may have done a blunder, by clearing all the app data of Google photos on my phone seeing if it'll reset google photos as I thought it's just a glitch and anyways everything is backed up.... But it's not a glitch and if I turn the backup back on, google will backup everything in my device again and might create a duplicate of everything on my account.... Tried backup with the settings menu too, everything has the same issue like this..... \n\n⭐Would LOVE to know any solutions to this.... Thanks!\n\nTLDR:\nDo NOT touch \"USE WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT\" on Google Photos if you don't want to backup everything on your phone from the beginning again.",

I looked at the product photos and it doesn't appear to have the thumbprint hole, but I've still been burned in the past by incorrect product photos when I tried to buy a replacement screen protector for my 6 Pro) \\*unfortunately the cheaper screen protector provided by Case-Mate is currently out of stock and I have no idea when or if it'll come back\n\n\\-Pixelsnap Charger with Stand (this is the big one; my main issue is that my previous Pixel Stand Charger that I used with the 6 Pro is very slow to charge my new 10 Pro XL because I guess they changed how the charging works)\n\n\\-finally, what Pixelsnap compatible case are you using? There's quite a few options and it's kind of overwhelming because there doesn't seem to be any reviews displayed for any of these accessories. Ideally I'd like one that protrudes out enough to protect the cameras on the back of the phone so I can maybe skip on buying a glass screen protector for the cameras, but it's difficult for me to tell if any of the cases are like that.\n\nIt's fine if you don't have the XL specifically, but have the regular 10 or the 10 Pro.

Even a 'Blur' brush, so we could blur that person out.\n\nI'm fully aware of Photoshop Express, Lightroom, Photoshop online (Adobe full package user) etc. But they take time to load up + load / import the image > edit it > save / export it > find which ever folder it's in > Move the image to the DCIM / Camera folder then it's date is different to the rest, so it's not in order... Yea, it's a faff.\n\nSo, @Google (do they even read this forum?), please, could you just add some more basic features to the default Google photo editing app?\n\n* Edit the pen thickness.\n* Add coloured shapes.\n* A blur tool to blur specific parts of an image.\n* Maybe an 'add other image, to the edit' option. Etc\n\nI'm sure Google has a mountain of people it can call upon to do this? Idk. Just a suggestion.\n\nKind regards, Dragonfyr",

I used to defend it like crazy — “It’s the cleanest Android,” “the best camera experience,” “Google knows what they’re doing.” Yeah… not anymore.\n\nThe current Pixel experience is honestly awful. The software stutters everywhere. The phone heats up while doing nothing. Heavy tasks? Don’t even think about it. Edge detection in portrait mode is still a joke — even random mid-range Chinese phones pull it off better. And we’re still missing portrait mode on the telephoto lens in 2025. Why?!\n\nAnd the worst part? That Sultan bug — the one that’s been around since 2023 — still not fixed. Like, how is this even acceptable? It’s been years.\n\nIt honestly feels like Google has stopped listening to its users. They’re too busy hyping up AI features no one asked for instead of fixing the core experience that made Pixels special in the first place.\n\nI used to love this phone — now I can barely use it without getting frustrated. Watching Google let the Pixel experience fall apart like this genuinely sucks.",

    "title": "A few questions...",
    "selftext": "I've been with Pixel quite a while now as I am not a Apple fan and like the camera performance, plus many updates compared to Samsung that basically seemed to want you to buy a new phone regularly so they didn't' update. \n\nCurrently 8 Pro. I'm not a phone expert so help please. \n\nKeyboard - there's a big white space at the bottom unused, but having large hands I'm always hitting a letter instead of space bar which is frustrating as there's free space there. Also, Apple for years has used a sort of zoom feature where the buttons get bigger as you approach them. Is there a solution or preferred keyboard? \n\nFiles - As a political warrior I use Threads / FB / Bluesky, however I'd like to manage my meme files better. Right now these apps default to their own folders. I'd like to be able to reorganize them all into topical folders so I can save time accessing them. Frequently I recall the file meme, but not where it is and have to search multiple locations. I realize much of this is likely app driven, but still would like to be more in control of these files! Suggestions? It would be preferred to have a \"Meme directory\". I have experience with MSDos and windows for years, but Android apps seems locked down and kind of stuck with awkwardness of these defaults. \n\nBluetooth - 1. with so many bluetooth devices nowadays, why the heck does Pixel only show about 3 of the saved ones, requiring another tap to \"see all\" when if they were all listed in the first place I could be there already?  2. I'd LOVE the ability to CONTROL BTooth connections FFS. My backyard has stereo speakers wired to a receiver with a BT add-on, and I ignorantly bought a second one same type for the main sound system. Unless I unplug the unwanted one, my phone will switch between them almost randomly w/o asking. My car uses a BT adapter plugged in and has its own BT circuit. To get the adapter to connect, I seem to have to \"forget\" the car BT and connect to the adapter, but it doesn't do this reliably. I have to keep trying over and over, for some reason it eventually works. The car BT \"asks\" to connect during this time seeming to interfere with my desired connection in the process. Maybe I'm a boomer but BT seems to be designed by sadists as its such a PITA. My phone also is reluctant to BT to my Win11 laptop for some reason as well, but supposed to be easy.  sigh.\n\nUpcoming alarm dismiss - this used to show up on my notification list, after a recent update it doesn't. I've gone through menus looking for a way to go back to having it listed, but to no avail. I take a morning med that has to be 1 hour before eating, and frequently my body wakes up before the alarm, so this is something that I deal with daily. Not huge but a step backwards.  ",

    "selftext": "This is to help save you the hassle of over a month of back and forth with Google support. \n\nMy experience - my Pixel 8 constantly disconnects from wifi network and Bluetooth and must be restarted to find the WiFi network again or to reconnect Bluetooth, which essentially renders the phone useless. This started happening after the last security patch. So, I contacted tech support and went through all the troubleshooting steps eventually having to completely wipe the phone with a factory reset. Google tells me there's nothing they can do beyond this and tell me they're going to replace the phone to solve this issue. Great!  Then I mention there's cosmetic damage on the screen. Nope!!! \"Since the device has some physical damages, this will void the warranty\"\n\nThe cosmetic damage on the screen has nothing to do with my issue, completely unrelated. Its like bringing your new car back to the dealer because the engine blew up but they won't warranty it because your windshield is cracked. It makes no sense... ",

(It's basically Google Files). Then I tried to switch back to my backup account on my phone, lo and behold the discovery: the backup got switched off when I switched to usiage without an account, and when I went back to my backup account, it started backup FRESH (ie started backing up everything on my phone again ~70GB/11000 files).\n\nI panicked and thought I lost everything, checked photos.google.com and thankfully my files, albums and face menu were all intact and already backed up. A sigh of relief indeed.\n\nAnd then I may have done a blunder, by clearing all the app data of Google photos on my phone seeing if it'll reset google photos as I thought it's just a glitch and anyways everything is backed up.... But it's not a glitch and if I turn the backup back on, google will backup everything in my device again and might create a duplicate of everything on my account.... Tried backup with the settings menu too, everything has the same issue like this..... \n\n⭐Would LOVE to know any solutions to this.... Thanks!\n\nTLDR:\nDo NOT touch \"USE WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT\" on Google Photos if you don't want to backup everything on your phone from the beginning again.",

I looked at the product photos and it doesn't appear to have the thumbprint hole, but I've still been burned in the past by incorrect product photos when I tried to buy a replacement screen protector for my 6 Pro) \\*unfortunately the cheaper screen protector provided by Case-Mate is currently out of stock and I have no idea when or if it'll come back\n\n\\-Pixelsnap Charger with Stand (this is the big one; my main issue is that my previous Pixel Stand Charger that I used with the 6 Pro is very slow to charge my new 10 Pro XL because I guess they changed how the charging works)\n\n\\-finally, what Pixelsnap compatible case are you using? There's quite a few options and it's kind of overwhelming because there doesn't seem to be any reviews displayed for any of these accessories. Ideally I'd like one that protrudes out enough to protect the cameras on the back of the phone so I can maybe skip on buying a glass screen protector for the cameras, but it's difficult for me to tell if any of the cases are like that.\n\nIt's fine if you don't have the XL specifically, but have the regular 10 or the 10 Pro.

Straight forward, opens and saves fast.\n\nBut, it's not great. For example. I want to block someone out of the photo (College Lecturer, infront, in the middle of the digital whiteboard), the only way to do that is use the markup pen, with the width of a human hair, to scribble that person out! Which takes forEVER!\n\nWouldn't it be easier if 1) We could change the thickness of the pen. Or 2) Just add a few black boxes over said person. Even a 'Blur' brush, so we could blur that person out.\n\nI'm fully aware of Photoshop Express, Lightroom, Photoshop online (Adobe full package user) etc. But they take time to load up + load / import the image > edit it > save / export it > find which ever folder it's in > Move the image to the DCIM / Camera folder then it's date is different to the rest, so it's not in order... Yea, it's a faff.\n\nSo, @Google (do they even read this forum?), please, could you just add some more basic features to the default Google photo editing app?\n\n* Edit the pen thickness.\n* Add coloured shapes.\n* A blur tool to blur specific parts of an image.\n* Maybe an 'add other image, to the edit' option. Etc\n\nI'm sure Google has a mountain of people it can call upon to do this? Idk. Just a suggestion.\n\nKind regards, Dragonfyr",

It has made the editing experience 10x worse without really any new benefits aside from \"AI\" nonsense that most of us have little care for.\n\nThis is just a rant.

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I’ve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion.

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

    "selftext": "I was a Galaxy user for about 10 years (starting with the S1 until the S7) and one thing that always drove me crazy was how my phones would slow down after a year or two. I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

    "selftext": "Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness?

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

And i was telling him why Samasung is better and how AI is light years ahead than Apple.\n\nSo we took a picture in his phone of his bike which was in front of us and his phone caught fast moving objects clearly in the background. Btw the objective was to see which Magic Eraser works better. Although Samsungs eraser was sooo much better... but on a different picture. Because my camera couldn't capture one vehicle in the background clearly.\n\nI do have Quick Tap Shutter on and Prioritize Focus over speed off. I thought Samsung could do better because it's pretty much iPhone 15 or 16 equivalent. Idk I thought camera was kinda close to iPhone but phone camers, i think iPhone wins hands down.",

No cross thread as I pulled it out and did it again on both 2 or 3 times to be certain.\n\nHas anyone else found that the thread depth isn't very deep on the top 2 screws for mounting?\n\nConsidering taking it down and quadruple checking but wanting to leave it.\n\nIts been 24 hours now, no movement so want to leave it on the wall but the anxiety in the back of my mind tells me otherwise. I fear ill keep going in circles and eventually ruin it myself.\n\nMake me feel better please haha.\n\n❤️",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

When I try to add the device in the Galaxy Wearable app, it’s successfully detected and added, but the connection process takes an indefinitely long time, and eventually, the message “Couldn’t connect to your watch” appears.

    "selftext": "So...... my phone (S21 Ultra) took a dive in a swimming pool.   I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

It turns out that there is a maximum number of alarms you can have in your Alarm app. I deleted all my alarms and tried setting a new one again, and it worked without any errors.\n\nI discovered this because when I attempted to set an alarm using Bixby, it informed me that I had reached the maximum number of alarms. However, when using Gemini, it simply gives an \"UNKNOWN ERROR\" message, even though it behaves as if the alarm was set. If you're not checking the watch display after asking Gemini, you might not even realize there's been an error.\n\nThanks to everyone who tried to help me earlier!",

My current watch is a simple FitBit Versa 3 (so any Galaxy watch will be an upgrade lol).\n\n- I mainly wish to use the watch as an extension of my phone (texting, calling, music control, etc) with my phone nearby, so the LTE function won't be a necessity.\n\n- The main secondary purpose I need my watch for is fitness tracking: Tracking heart rate, steps, calories, distance, etc.\n\nI am on the fence right now. I have found a 47mm Galaxy 6 Classic for quite a good deal ($109 for the bluetooth OR LTE model), and that is the model I'm leaning towards. But before I buy, I want to know if paying an extra $100-$150 for the Galaxy 7 would be worth it for any newer specs or features that it has. \n\nI won't be using my watch as much for temperature tracking and GPS purposes (beyond tracking running/biking distance which I can also have my phone on me for). \n\nI also dont plan to download a ton of apps (mainly the defaults, a few interchangable watch faces, timer, calorie tracking, metronome, Spotify control, and possibly 1 or 2 games) so I'm unsure of how much of an impact the 16GB to 32GB difference would make on my satisfaction with either one. \n\nPlease, any insight, advice, and experience would be greatly appreciated!

When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

    "selftext": "I have been a long time smartwatch user and have tried a lot of brands. I have mostly settled on Samsung and Amazfit but each is missing something. This is short wish list of changes for Galaxy watches:\n\n  \n1) **let me swipe away individual notifications**. Right now, I have to clear all of them at once, or tap on each one and clear it. I would rather just swipe from the list to do some quick triaging;\n\n2) **improve the step count deduping** between watch and phone. Right now it really seems to overcount, so I just turn off step counting on my phone, which is a shame because it would be nice to track some steps while my watch is charging\n\n3) **add Energy Score to the Galaxy Fit 3.** that would make it a great companion to the Galaxy watch. I could wear it at night for seemless tracking. I also prefer it for some sports where I want a smaller, lighter device and I dont need GPS\n\n  \n4) **Make message replies via voice faster**. On Amazfit, I can tap the notification, then hold down a button to active the voice assistant and can directly dictate. On WearOS, it takes a lot of taps to do that (tap the notification, open on watch, reply, keyboard, swipe up to select different keyboards, tap the microphone icon)\n\n  \n5) **consider swiping up for notifications and using both left and right swipes to access tiles**. That lets me get at my 2 most important tiles with a single swipe.\n\n  \n5a) *bonus* \\- **consider a shortcut tile**. Amazfit does this well and has it as a list you can scroll through. Galaxy watches have this a bit with the new tile designs but it still caps at 4.\n\n\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Maybe it's just me :)",

The other 2 moderators have been inactive for a few months, so I’ve taken over the role as top moderator for the community. I’ve been doing some spring cleaning and updates, with the biggest changes being:\n\n\n\n* The rules list is much clearer and more detailed\n* The rule on Watch Face Posts is now:\n   * Pictures of real watches are allowed, but advertisements are not.\n   * See the included image as an example\n\n\n\nSome other smaller changes:\n\n\n\n* More “Similar Communities” subreddits are on the sidebar\n* Flairs have been cleaned up slightly and might be combined in the future.\n* The backlog of unprocessed rule violation reports has been actioned and cleared\n   * If your post or comment was accidentally removed, let me know!\n* A comment sticky has been created clarifying the new Watch Face Post rule\n\n\n\nWe will be doing a call for moderators in the future.

That was really challenging and instead of upping my Tempo, I was glad, I was able to hold it.\nAfter 9 minutes, it told me, to run AS FAST AS I CAN. So, I did.

Needless to say, that training session was over for me and left me frustrated.\nDid I do something wrong or am I just not fit enough?\n\n",

It also does this for the timer, which is also annoying when I'm at the gym and it minimizes it when I'm doing 1 minute reps. But that's not as essential.

    "selftext": "Input data:   \nWatch – Galaxy Watch 7   \nPhone – Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro   \n  \nFirst of all, the reason I decided to reset my watch was that my phone wasn’t syncing daily activity data with the Samsung Health app. In addition, when I tried to use the “Find your phone” feature, the watch displayed a “Couldn’t connect to your phone” (or something similar) error pop-up, even though it was properly paired with my Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro. It felt like the watch was paired with my phone, but not actually connected. After I reset the watch, I successfully paired it with my phone again, but the message “Check your phone to complete setup” keeps lingering. When I try to add the device in the Galaxy Wearable app, it’s successfully detected and added, but the connection process takes an indefinitely long time, and eventually, the message “Couldn’t connect to your watch” appears. Interestingly, the Bluetooth connection between the phone and the watch gets disconnected automatically afterwards. I have no idea what to do next.   \n  \nHas anyone encountered something similar? If so, how did you solve it? Honestly, I’m getting pretty desperate…",

That was really challenging and instead of upping my Tempo, I was glad, I was able to hold it.\nAfter 9 minutes, it told me, to run AS FAST AS I CAN. So, I did. After 30 seconds of sprinting, I was at the end of my capacity and stopped and saw that the watch wanted me to sprint for another 150 seconds! Needless to say, that training session was over for me and left me frustrated.\nDid I do something wrong or am I just not fit enough?\n\n",

Does anybody know how I can set it to the old way where it takes up the whole screen? It also does this for the timer, which is also annoying when I'm at the gym and it minimizes it when I'm doing 1 minute reps. But that's not as essential. I have googled other reddit posts but they're all old/out dated/have instructions to options that no longer exist. I'd really appreciate some help. Thank you! ",

I researched with chat gpt and it recommended me for storage \"SSD CRUCIAL 500GB BX500 CT500BX500SSD1 2,5 SATA3 [r/W](https://www.reddit.com/r/W/) 550/500 (SIAE)\" and that I can easily put it into my empty slot that I still have (did not open the laptop to check if thats true, gave the chat my submodel number and it said that I have a slot open if I didnt do anything, which I did not).  \nFor the Ram it recommended me to switch the 4GB RAM which arent soldered with 8GB RAM, because the 16GB RAM wouldn't make a big difference, because the integrated memory controller from my RYZEN-CPU doesn't recognize more than 12GB RAM. For that it recommended me the \"**Crucial CT8G4SFS824A** (8 GB DDR4-2400 CL17)\".  \nNow I really don't know much about all of this (thats why I asked chat gpt in the first place, but I didn't want to trust chat gpt blindly), so I wanted to ask u all what u think about it, are there better options or are the things that chat gpt recommended good?\n\nThank u for reading all of that and best case helping me :)",

There is a little plastic thing that flips down on the ribbon clip and it had come out. I tried to get it back in but didn't really have the proper tools or magnification and then I lost it. It might have been damaged anyway. \n\nI know a good motherboard guy. He says he can't really replace the whole piece because he can't order it and I think because it would be a lot of work to replace. But he said if I had the plastic clip he might be able to put it back in and make it work. I've read here or there about some people just placing the ribbon and taping it down but not sure if that would work here and also it's for my girlfriend instead of myself so I want to fix it right. \n\nA replacement motherboard is about 200 bucks. There is what I think is the right motherboard broken on eBay for 70 bucks. Maybe he would take less. Is there any way to identify this particular part and just ordered the clip to take the plastic piece off of? Or replace? \n\nI'm not 100% sure it's just this. There's a chance something else is wrong with the motherboard. Long story. But I don't mind spending maybe 50 to 75 bucks to fix this part and go from there. \n\nFirst picture is my motherboard.

Your cpu will avoid those large spikes in power consumption and clock speed, making it way cooler.\n\nSecond step is undervolting \n\nfor amd cpus or intel HX series they have no restrictions and can use software and guides to do this \n\nBut this guide will be for intel 12th generation and newer a way to under volt your cpu with simple toggle it's not better than manual undervolting but absolutely better than nothing so by toggling energy saver always on in windows 24h2 only you actually get  you cpu undervolted \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/YiVBeU7\n\nThis makes you cpu cooler and stop it from any thermal throttling and make it more power efficient.\n\nWith just 2 steps i got my temps from 70 to 80 dgree browsing to average 50-60 and lower sometimes and in gaming I saw no noticeable preformance loss and cpu behavior of throttling it self and then going down is gone which give better 1% lows and more constant preformance.

Also moving the hinge or screen to fold it down also makes the line act weird\n\nIs it possible to figure out without going to a repair shop for a diagnosis?",

    "selftext": "I'm looking for advice on what would work out best for me. It would be my first personal laptop. I would mainly use it for Office 365, Calibre and converting my albums into mp3 files to transfer to my mp3 player (I know laptops with CD player slots are kinda unusual this days but I can also get an external CD player to connect to the laptop so that's not an issue for me). I don't particularly want to use it for games since I've always preferred to play in my phone/tablet, if I ever play a game on the laptop, it would be Minecraft, but it's not a priority. I would like it to be a Windows OS and something durable since I don't plan on upgrading for several years.\n\nMy planned budget is between $800-$900 USD but I barely know anything about what I should look for since I've always been more of a phone/tablet girl. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should look for? Is my budget too high or too low on what I'm looking for? Any advice is appreciated.",

Should I focus on gaming laptops or productivity laptops? (would prefer a lighter laptop but not necessary)\n2. Should I get one with dedicated GPU or will an integrated GPU be enough?\n3. Which brands and more importantly series of laptops should I focus on? (I know that Lenovo Thinkpads are great for Linux but which series? And which other ones?)\n\nFrom my research I have gathered (what kind of specs I should look for so the laptop lasts long):\n\n- AMD Ryzen AI 5 or 7 (I like AMD more but feel free to recommend Intel too)\n- 32 GB RAM (upgradable nice to have)\n- 1 TB SSD (upgradable nice to have)\n- if Dedicated GPU than AMD (since Nvidia doesn't play nice with Linux)\n- I/O like HDMI, USB Type A ports and Type C charging (nice to have but not necessary)\n\nThanks for the help in advance :)",

My Priorities:\n\n\n\n* **Primary Use:** Heavy programming, coding, running IDEs, virtual environments, and general productivity.\n* **Secondary Use (Gaming):** Light gaming only (nothing AAA like Cyberpunk). I want to run simple games with the **best possible graphics settings** while keeping the laptop relatively simple and functional.\n* **CRITICAL CONCERN: Noise (Fans):** I will be using this laptop frequently in quiet classroom settings. I need to know if I should expect the fans to spin up loudly during heavy programming tasks (like compiling large projects) on a budget gaming or performance laptop. **How loud will it get during a coding session?**\n\n\n\n# 2. The Budget Conundrum: Laptop vs. Handheld\n\n\n\nI'm considering two main options given the price point:\n\n**Option A (The Hybrid):** Buy a budget gaming laptop (e.g., one with an RTX 3050 or similar) that covers both coding and light gaming.\n\n**Option B (The Split):** Buy a very quiet and high-performance **productivity laptop** (focusing on a strong CPU and 16GB RAM for coding) and use the remaining budget (or slightly more) to purchase a dedicated **gaming handheld console** (like a Steam Deck or used ROG Ally) for the light gaming.\n\n**Which option do you think provides the best value and solves my fan noise problem in the classroom?**\n\n\n\n# 3. Recommendations Needed\n\n\n\nWhat specific laptop models (or configurations) would you recommend that hit this sweet spot, especially those known for having **decent cooling/noise management**?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

Here’s what’s happening:\n\nLaptop powers on: keyboard lights turn on, fans spin\n\nScreen stays completely black\n\nExternal monitor via HDMI only shows the desktop after I log in\n\nKeyboard lights behave oddly: Fn+Space works to toggle keyboard backlight, but Caps Lock and Escape lights stay on and don’t toggle\n\nI haven’t touched anything except the hinges\n\n\nI’ve tried:\n\nUsing an external display (works only after login)\n\nObserving the screen in a dark room for faint images (can’t see anything)\n\n\nI suspect it might be a loose or damaged display cable due to the hinge, but I’m not sure.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? How can I safely test if the internal screen or cable is damaged, or if the backlight is dead? Any guidance would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

What counts in their mind as a \"budget/bad\" laptop?\n\nJust to be clear here, I am not asking for a \"bad\" laptop when I say budget... looking for something between the best of both worlds.\n\nIdeally something around \\~ $1,000 might be around my max price \n\n  \nThe Surface Pro laptop I wanted was \\~ $2,000 which I would love but need to save money right now.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n  \n(Back to  [https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1l8fcnh/what\\_are\\_your\\_thoughts\\_on\\_2in1\\_laptops/](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1l8fcnh/what_are_your_thoughts_on_2in1_laptops/) )\n\n\n\nSo, would that person in the other post consider a \"budget\" laptop to be \\~$1,000 or are they talking about something below \\~$300? Since I see some results for that like around \\~$260 or \\~$270, perhaps that's what they meant by a \"bad budget\" 2-in-1 laptop?\n\n\n\nWhat do you all recommend? ",

Stop code: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL\n\nI was able to open it again so I played again. Got the same error. This time when I opened it, I got an error INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE. For days I've been trying to figure everything out then I got in my laptop again. I used it just to browse and discord. I got BSOD again. \n\nIt also affected the power mechanism. Like when I shut it down, the fans keeps on spinning and the keyboard stays lit up. I have to press the button long to turn it off completely. Then when I try to turn it on, it doesn't. I have to always press it for 30 secs and let it rest for a couple of minutes to make it work again. Also when I try to restart, it just shuts down the laptop. Doesn't turn on again \n\nSo I got frustrated and decided to reformat my laptop with rufus to a usb stick. After long nights of searching cuz my USB stick doesn't appear on my BIOS, I just ran the .exe file on the computer. It was installing windows 11. After it finished, windows said it'll restart my laptop. It tried but again, it didn't restart. Just shut down.\n\nI turned it on, it was showing like 4 lines information about my memory and it was loading and it loaded 100% 16GB. Then, nothing happened. I turned it off and on again. This time it says no bootable device. I did that twice and same shi showed up. The 3rd time, now I get stucked here. I can't even see my BIOS or the ACER Logo... \n\nCan anybody help me? I just want to finish formatting my laptop so I can fkin sell this piece of shit",

I've looked all kinds of laptop and maybe the best two brands are Asus and Lenovo( is it?) if so, which is better? I've found IdeaPad that are good, Asus ZenBook and Asus vivo book even Asus gaming f15/f16 but they are for gaming mostly. I really don't know which is better, I've been looking even for CPU benchmark tests but the rating for them is almost the same. Does anyone have some tips? What should I do? I wanna have a good deal and a performing PC for my budget. Can anyone help? Thanks",

I researched with chat gpt and it recommended me for storage \"SSD CRUCIAL 500GB BX500 CT500BX500SSD1 2,5 SATA3 [r/W](https://www.reddit.com/r/W/) 550/500 (SIAE)\" and that I can easily put it into my empty slot that I still have (did not open the laptop to check if thats true, gave the chat my submodel number and it said that I have a slot open if I didnt do anything, which I did not).  \nFor the Ram it recommended me to switch the 4GB RAM which arent soldered with 8GB RAM, because the 16GB RAM wouldn't make a big difference, because the integrated memory controller from my RYZEN-CPU doesn't recognize more than 12GB RAM. For that it recommended me the \"**Crucial CT8G4SFS824A** (8 GB DDR4-2400 CL17)\".  \nNow I really don't know much about all of this (thats why I asked chat gpt in the first place, but I didn't want to trust chat gpt blindly), so I wanted to ask u all what u think about it, are there better options or are the things that chat gpt recommended good?\n\nThank u for reading all of that and best case helping me :)",

There is a little plastic thing that flips down on the ribbon clip and it had come out. I tried to get it back in but didn't really have the proper tools or magnification and then I lost it. It might have been damaged anyway. \n\nI know a good motherboard guy. He says he can't really replace the whole piece because he can't order it and I think because it would be a lot of work to replace. But he said if I had the plastic clip he might be able to put it back in and make it work. I've read here or there about some people just placing the ribbon and taping it down but not sure if that would work here and also it's for my girlfriend instead of myself so I want to fix it right. \n\nA replacement motherboard is about 200 bucks. There is what I think is the right motherboard broken on eBay for 70 bucks. Maybe he would take less. Is there any way to identify this particular part and just ordered the clip to take the plastic piece off of? Or replace? \n\nI'm not 100% sure it's just this. There's a chance something else is wrong with the motherboard. Long story. But I don't mind spending maybe 50 to 75 bucks to fix this part and go from there. \n\nFirst picture is my motherboard. Second and third are one for sale on eBay for comparison. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wyaoYV3#dTx6d3D\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wyaoYV3#3RvHuxC\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wyaoYV3\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kiBUxvv\nAny advice appreciated.",

I also had to get Corsair RAM from Best buy, even though I'm pretty biased toward G.Skill, since the DDR5 I actually want is inflated so high. It's not what I wanted. It is 6000, but it's only 32GB and it's CL is 36 instead of 30. I'll probably return it honestly. But other than that, I wanted to ask if anyone who has used this AIO cooler has had any issues with USB power delivery. It is causing some intermittent weird issues with my ports. I also wanted to make sure my temps were okay. It's idling at 118-120F (Btw, I use Fahrenheit, sorry.) [Images](https://imgur.com/a/4Rs1SvH)",

    "selftext": "I am building my first PC. I didn't find a free anti-sag guide for my GPU, motherboard and case. So I am making one.\n\nThis will probably work on most computers, but I have no experience with other PC's so do it at your own risk.\n\nOne of my wires looks bad because I am not done with cable management.\n\n**\\*Pictures\\***\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/5FslYdV](https://imgur.com/a/5FslYdV)\n\n**\\*My Computer parts\\***\n\nGPU **-** Asus PRIME GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB Video Card\n\nMotherboard **-** ASRock B850M Pro RS Micro ATX AM5 Motherboard\n\nCase **-** Montech X5M MicroATX Mini Tower Case\n\nThe other parts should not matter but just in case, here is a link. [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6wd6GJ](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6wd6GJ)\n\n**\\*Parts for anti-sag\\***\n\n4 Twist ties.\n\nA drill with small drill bit. (A Sharp knife will work also)\n\nA ruler to measure distance.\n\nA plastic pill bottle that is same height you measured. (Mine was around 58mm but yours might be different)\n\n**\\*How to make it\\***\n\nStart by measuring your case floor to gpu bottom on the left side. Do this while it is on it's side so it is not sagging at all.\n\nStart looking around for pill bottles that are either the exact same size or 1-3 millimeters shorter.\n\nThe best size is about 1-3 millimeters shorter. The reason for this is because it is better for the GPU to **slightly** sag down rather than you slightly bend it upwards by accident. You definitely do not want to go above even, so if you not sure use just a tiny sag. Exact size is great as long as you are confident that you are not bending the GPU upward.\n\nDon't ever force the bottle in. If the GPU is resisting or looks bent upward find something slightly shorter.\n\n**Look at my pictures if instructions are confusing.** Drill holes on the sides as close as you can to the bottom without drilling through the bottom. If you don't have a drill, use a sharp knife and twist while pushing in. It will take a long time but the knife will eventually cut a hole. The holes should be equal distance apart with first 2 holes on opposite ends of each other and the last 2 holes on opposite ends of each other.\n\nPut a twist tie in one hole and another in the opposite hole. Put as far as you can in without going fully through. Grab the other side of both twist ties inside the bottle. There should be just enough length to twist them together at the very end. Once they are twisted together pull them on both ends on the outside of the bottle to test that your twist is holding together. Repeat for other 2 holes. **See my pictures if you don't understand.**\n\nPlace the bottle underneath the GPU on the right side. Be careful to put in on a flat part of the GPU and **do not put it on the fan**. Once you are sure it is in a safe place, put each twist tie in a hole on the bottom of the case that is as close as possible to the hole on the bottle.\n\nNow go to the other side of the PC. The hardest part is pulling the twist ties through on the bottom and twisting them. On my PC the space below is too tight for me to put my hand inside. There is a bigger space just to the right. I lift my cables, put my hand in the big space, then bend my hand so my finders can grab to the left inside the small space. I was barely able to reach the twist ties. I twisted 2 ties at a time using ones on opposite ends of the pill bottle for maximum tightness.\n\nThe last thing to do is to grab the pill bottle and try to move it side to side with just a little bit of force. It should not move at all. That way you know it will never hit your fan.\n\n**A tip for my PC**\n\nIf you happen to have the exact same computer as me you can try this. I found a pill bottle that is the exact size I need. It is a CVS adult low dose aspirin bottle. It has 36 chewable tablets at 81 mg. They might change the bottle size over time, so don't assume you can buy one and it will work. This one is either the exact same size or 1-2 mm shorter on my PC.",

While cleaning my pc, I realized the places where you screw in your parts are a bit scratched/wear down due to the screws. For example, the chassis where you screw in the fans, the gpu, etc. Another example, is the screw thats used to open/close the pc glass panel (I have the NZXT H9 flow case). The screw slightly sticks out when you open and close the panel, and it caused a minor indentation. Is this normal/unavoidable? Or is this due to carelessness? \n",

My current setup is really starting to **struggle**, and I'm **torn between** a cost-effective **AM4 upgrade** and making the **expensive jump to AM5**.\n\nMy main use case is a mix of **video editing** and **gaming**.\n\n\n\nMy Current Specs:\n\n\n\nCPU: **Ryzen 5 4600G**\n\nGPU: **GALAX GeForce RTX™ 3060 Ti**\n\nRAM: 1x Lexar Thor 16GB DDR4 3200MHz CL16 (i am planning to add another one of the same ram this week if i stay am4)\n\nMotherboard: **Gigabyte A520M K V2**\n\nPSU: **Inplay GS 550W** (I know this is **bad**, it's my top priority to replace first!)\n\nThe **Ryzen 5 4600G** is a real **hindrance right now** and is **bottlenecking** my 3060 Ti hard in both editing and gaming.\n\nFor gaming, I got the 3060 Ti for a great price, and I know it can perform well at 1080p, which is all I'm targeting. I mostly play lighter esports titles, but I also love heavy AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077, Dying Light 2, Outer Worlds 2, Arc Raiders, and Battlefield 6.\n\nAs a perfect example, **in Cyberpunk 2077, I get 50-60 FPS whether I'm on Ultra settings or the absolute Lowest settings, even with DLSS on.** It's a clear sign my CPU is holding me back, and it's super frustrating.\n\n**Option 1: The AM4 Path**\n\n\n\nCPU: **Ryzen 7 5700X**\n\nMotherboard: **MSI B550M Pro VDH**\n\nRAM: **Add a matching 16GB 3200MHz stick (for 32GB total)**\n\nPSU: **A new, quality 650W-750W PSU**\n\nThis seems like the **cheaper**, more **immediate upgrade**.\n\n\n\n**Option 2: The AM5 Path**\n\n\n\nCPU: **Ryzen 7 7700**\n\nMotherboard: **An Asus B650M-AYW WIFI DDR5 PCIe 5.0 M.2**\n\nRAM: **New 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 6000MHz kit**\n\nPSU: **A new, quality 650W-750W PSU**\n\n\n\nMy Dilemma\n\n\n\n**AM5** is obviously more future-proof, but it's s**ignificantly more expensive**. I feel like I'm a bit late to the PC building scene.\n\nI can wait a few more months to save up for the AM5 parts, but my current **PC's performance** is very **frustrating** to deal with right now and it **hinders my editing** workloads, and **especially gaming**.\n\nIs the performance jump to AM5 **worth the extra cost** and the wait? Or is the 5700X upgrade on **AM4 a smart, budget-friendly choice** that will hold me over for the next few years?\n\nWhat would you do in my position? Thanks!",

The more the merrier. \n\nAs for the RAM, I just want to know if there are any good budget options for 32g or 64g packages. No RGB required. I do a lot of gaming & multitasking. \nReally I am not as worried about this as the mobo at the moment. I know I’ll need to upgrade to new gen memory when I make the swap, but that’s easier. I just figured I could include this. ",

    "selftext": "guys, i have a question about my mobo: AB350M HDV 4.0. it's an old system that needs to be upgraded.   \nThis is my first time attempting to mod a pc, i find it to be very challenging because it's always need to update A, can't do it without updating B, which can't be updated without C and etc..  \n\nThe mobo default is 1.2 V and 2400 Mhz\n\nMy current memory stick that came with prebuilt is 1x8gb, 1.35v 3000mhz\n\nMy CPU is OLD, ryzen 3 2300x. My goal is not gaming, just surfing and work. I have a few questions:\n\n  \n1) **Main Question**: I want to upgrade ram to 16 (2x8), i got a deal for 3200 mhz 1.35v, is this gonna cause any issues (ie blue screen), I don't wanna enable XMP or any overclocking. I prefer default settings at 2400 (less headache). Should I go for 2400 mhz instead? I saw online someone using 3200 and it defaulted to 2600 and gave him a blue screen but I'm not sure if I understood everything. How can ram be down clocked to 2600 when default is set at 2400 mhz?\n\n2)  Today I added a NVMe and wanted to install windows OS on it. But PC crashed at splash logo due bios 2.0 being too old. Will Sata SDD work instead? I can't upgrade bios without upgrading CPU \n\n  \n3) if I want to upgrade CPU, which would be the \"best\" for this mobo without too much mod? Is there a \"plug and play\" cpu that i can just add and not worry about anything breaking? are there any limitations? ie need to improve PSU, need more RAM, etc \n\nPlease help! Thank you in advance!",

Thanks for your replies!\n\n\n\nI'm currently pricing up a server to run multiplayer games like Conan, Minecraft & 7 days.  My plan is to run proxmox and have two VMs, one linux and one win11pro (for games w/o linux server software).  I understand that most game servers are single threaded so I should look to a faster clock than number of cores.\n\n**Is it worth getting a Ryzen CPU with X3D?**  Will it benefit an effectively headless server?  The sale pitch says the 3D cache is great for single threaded games but I suspect that's only relevant to rendering games, which won't happen on the server obviously.  For comparison, a 9900X is $230 cheaper for me than a 9900X3D.  I expect that will also hold true for the 8 and 12 core chips.\n\nThanks",

I wanted to keep my current 870 ssd and have a second ssd. Was thinking Samsung or the Western Digital unless there's a better option out there? I've had a cheaper HD die on me before so I don't mind spending a little more so that peace of mind. I'm not sure what fans to get to help with the cooling. I wanted to get the Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE ARGB unless the 9800x3d needs an AIO cooler. It doesn't seem like it does but I could be wrong. I'm also torn on what case fans to get. I looked at the Noctua fans but they seem pricey. ",

I think tablets would be too small.\n\nAnyone know of any 27\" monitors (preferably touch screen) that could be laid flat?  It looks like all the AIO computers and monitors are designed to be placed vertically.  The Yoga AIO computers look promising but it doesn't look like it's designed to lay flat.  \n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.",

The thing is, I really hate how freaking loud it is. The fan whine when it's stressed is crazy.\n\nI want a quiet PC. I want better performance, but don't need high end performance. I want good VRAM as I play at 1440p.\n\nSeems like my options are B580 12GB, 9060 XT 16GB, or 5060 Ti 16GB.\n\nnVidia seems like the easy choice, and probably what I would choose between that and AMD.

    "selftext": "I heard a rumor that there will be refresh nvidia cards over the next couple months with 24gb vram.\n\nThis is great!  But right now, most games don't require 24gb.  (In fact, do any games require it? )  Outside of LLM and VR, it seems that 16gb is sufficient.\n\nHowever, if you \"peel the onion\" it is reasonable to surmise that once mainstream cards have 24gb, developers will start to utilize it.  The 5070Ti Super apparently will get a 10% fps boost along with extra vram, which will make it a great entry 4K card.\n\nAre games currently developed with the understanding that almost no one has > 16gb vram?  If the 5070Ti/5080 super have 24gb vram, that means that the next gen cards (midrange and above) will also have 24gb.  Which means that beginning 2027, the majority of 4K cards will have it.  How long will it take developers to take advantage of this?  When will 16gb start feeling small?\n\nIn my opinion, in 2027+ there will be a group of otherwise 4K capable cards that don't have 24GB. 4080/S, 5070ti, 5080.  I believe it would be wise to avoid these.",

I've tested all the sticks as well as all of the slots and none of them are defective, and I didn't have a single issue with any of them on my old motherboard. No matter how much I lower the RAM speed, it still freezes up before it can even get to the login screen. I know I don't *need* all four sticks, since 32gb will also run just fine, but I would definitely like to be able to use the memory that I paid for so this is still insanely frustrating. Could it maybe be a software issue? BIOS is up to date and everything. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "I’m slowly gathering parts for a new build. I plan to get a 5070 TI and I was looking at the Montech Century II 850w PSU. \n\nMy question being would the PCIe cables that comes with that PSU work with the 5070ti? \n\nI’m new to building and the cables and connectors are kinda confusing whether to use 12v-2x6, is the 12v-2x6 ideal to use or just daisy chain with the 6+2 PCIe? Or am I getting that wrong. But any help would be appreciated I just want to make sure I order the correct PSU suited for the gpu. \n\nAlso i am aiming for a clean build so I’ve seen some AsiaHorse cable extensions but there’s a bunch of different kinds. Is there a specific one i need or can someone recommend one i should get that’s compatible with the PSU I am looking at?

My plan is to run proxmox and have two VMs, one linux and one win11pro (for games w/o linux server software).  I understand that most game servers are single threaded so I should look to a faster clock than number of cores.\n\n**Is it worth getting a Ryzen CPU with X3D?**  Will it benefit an effectively headless server?  The sale pitch says the 3D cache is great for single threaded games but I suspect that's only relevant to rendering games, which won't happen on the server obviously.  For comparison, a 9900X is $230 cheaper for me than a 9900X3D.  I expect that will also hold true for the 8 and 12 core chips.\n\nThanks",

    "selftext": "It happen suddenly  on early this month of October 2025, my pc failed to boot. I rarely switch on my pc as this months im quite busy with my job. I bought and setup my pc on March this year. The specs of my pc as follow:\n\n  \nCPU: Ryzen 7 9700x (year 2023) Air-cooled Phantom spirit\n\nM/B: Asrock X870 Steel Legend (on 3.26 bios when it happened)\n\nRam: 32gb XPG Lancer Blade ( 2x 16gb at 6000Mhz)\n\nGPU: Gigabyte RTX 2060 (Needing an upgrade (--) )\n\nPSU: Corsair CV650 650W (upgrade later with gpu maybe)\n\nSo the cpu led just lights up red on the m/b and nothing happen, no boot, just blank screen. I've tried reseat the ram, reseat the cpu, psu, and even upgrading the bios. Same thing just the red led on the cpu. Then lucky me i managed to claim a waranty for the cpu unit, and got the replacement today.\n\nJust want to let you all know, im not so sure if it was a faulty cpu, or m/b that causing the dead of the cpu, i never did any overclocking, undervolt or anything to the cpu, im just enabling PBO and running bios 3.26 until then. The cpu was running fine and I didnot update the bios (but i did when the first setup). \n\nThere was no any physical damage to cpu nor the m/b, like a burnt mark or any scratches. So as for right now im scared to enable pbo in the bios and will let it run at 4800mhz coz i need this rig for my work. \n\nGiving failed cpu issue on asrock m/b right now like the 9800x3d, make me uneasy and should i replace my motherboard guys? Anyone have the same issue with 9700x? Or maybe any suggestion to make this cpu runs well and last\n\n\n\n",

I recently posted the [build](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VjkRDj) I was working on, and was given a lot of great information. I did change a few things from the original post because of the recommendations. I also had to get Corsair RAM from Best buy, even though I'm pretty biased toward G.Skill, since the DDR5 I actually want is inflated so high. It's not what I wanted. It is 6000, but it's only 32GB and it's CL is 36 instead of 30. I'll probably return it honestly. But other than that, I wanted to ask if anyone who has used this AIO cooler has had any issues with USB power delivery. It is causing some intermittent weird issues with my ports. I also wanted to make sure my temps were okay. It's idling at 118-120F (Btw, I use Fahrenheit, sorry.) [Images](https://imgur.com/a/4Rs1SvH)",

When I select the disk and it moves to the screen that shows the installation percentage, the download/copy either **freezes or the PC simply reboots**.\n\nI built this machine using spare parts from upgrades to other systems: a **Ryzen 5 5600G**, **16GB of RAM**, a **512GB M.2 drive**, a **Gigabyte A520M H motherboard**, and a **500W power supply**.\n\nHere is what I have tried:\n\n* Updating the **BIOS to the latest version**.\n* Checking the **TPM and Secure Boot** settings.\n* Changing the **USB drive** used for installation.\n* Verifying the **ISO hash** (to ensure the installer is not corrupted).\n* Swapping out the **motherboard**.\n* Changing the **power supply**.\n* Swapping the **RAM sticks**.\n* Installing a **dedicated GPU**\n* Changing the **M.2 drive**.\n\nThe only component I have **not** swapped is the **processor**\n\nHowever, I tried installing **Linux (Ubuntu)** and it installed without any problems. I then ran stress tests, **Memtest**, and scanned the M.2s/HDDs with **Victoria**—and I never had a single issue in Ubuntu. Even stressing the processor for hours, it never rebooted or did anything strange.\n\nIt is **only when attempting to install Windows** that I get these freezing and rebooting problems during the installation process.\n\nI also installed Windows on a different PC, then put the M.2 drive into this assembly, but after a short while, it would **crash or freeze**, which honestly makes no sense to me.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar. Any recommendation is welcome",

    "selftext": "I am building my first PC. I didn't find a free anti-sag guide for my GPU, motherboard and case. So I am making one.\n\nThis will probably work on most computers, but I have no experience with other PC's so do it at your own risk.\n\nOne of my wires looks bad because I am not done with cable management.\n\n**\\*Pictures\\***\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/5FslYdV](https://imgur.com/a/5FslYdV)\n\n**\\*My Computer parts\\***\n\nGPU **-** Asus PRIME GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB Video Card\n\nMotherboard **-** ASRock B850M Pro RS Micro ATX AM5 Motherboard\n\nCase **-** Montech X5M MicroATX Mini Tower Case\n\nThe other parts should not matter but just in case, here is a link. [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6wd6GJ](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6wd6GJ)\n\n**\\*Parts for anti-sag\\***\n\n4 Twist ties.\n\nA drill with small drill bit. (A Sharp knife will work also)\n\nA ruler to measure distance.\n\nA plastic pill bottle that is same height you measured. (Mine was around 58mm but yours might be different)\n\n**\\*How to make it\\***\n\nStart by measuring your case floor to gpu bottom on the left side. Do this while it is on it's side so it is not sagging at all.\n\nStart looking around for pill bottles that are either the exact same size or 1-3 millimeters shorter.\n\nThe best size is about 1-3 millimeters shorter. The reason for this is because it is better for the GPU to **slightly** sag down rather than you slightly bend it upwards by accident. You definitely do not want to go above even, so if you not sure use just a tiny sag. Exact size is great as long as you are confident that you are not bending the GPU upward.\n\nDon't ever force the bottle in. If the GPU is resisting or looks bent upward find something slightly shorter.\n\n**Look at my pictures if instructions are confusing.** Drill holes on the sides as close as you can to the bottom without drilling through the bottom. If you don't have a drill, use a sharp knife and twist while pushing in. It will take a long time but the knife will eventually cut a hole. The holes should be equal distance apart with first 2 holes on opposite ends of each other and the last 2 holes on opposite ends of each other.\n\nPut a twist tie in one hole and another in the opposite hole. Put as far as you can in without going fully through. Grab the other side of both twist ties inside the bottle. There should be just enough length to twist them together at the very end. Once they are twisted together pull them on both ends on the outside of the bottle to test that your twist is holding together. Repeat for other 2 holes. **See my pictures if you don't understand.**\n\nPlace the bottle underneath the GPU on the right side. Be careful to put in on a flat part of the GPU and **do not put it on the fan**. Once you are sure it is in a safe place, put each twist tie in a hole on the bottom of the case that is as close as possible to the hole on the bottle.\n\nNow go to the other side of the PC. The hardest part is pulling the twist ties through on the bottom and twisting them. On my PC the space below is too tight for me to put my hand inside. There is a bigger space just to the right. I lift my cables, put my hand in the big space, then bend my hand so my finders can grab to the left inside the small space. I was barely able to reach the twist ties. I twisted 2 ties at a time using ones on opposite ends of the pill bottle for maximum tightness.\n\nThe last thing to do is to grab the pill bottle and try to move it side to side with just a little bit of force. It should not move at all. That way you know it will never hit your fan.\n\n**A tip for my PC**\n\nIf you happen to have the exact same computer as me you can try this. I found a pill bottle that is the exact size I need. It is a CVS adult low dose aspirin bottle. It has 36 chewable tablets at 81 mg. They might change the bottle size over time, so don't assume you can buy one and it will work. This one is either the exact same size or 1-2 mm shorter on my PC.",

While cleaning my pc, I realized the places where you screw in your parts are a bit scratched/wear down due to the screws. For example, the chassis where you screw in the fans, the gpu, etc. Another example, is the screw thats used to open/close the pc glass panel (I have the NZXT H9 flow case). The screw slightly sticks out when you open and close the panel, and it caused a minor indentation. Is this normal/unavoidable? Or is this due to carelessness? \n",

My current setup is really starting to **struggle**, and I'm **torn between** a cost-effective **AM4 upgrade** and making the **expensive jump to AM5**.\n\nMy main use case is a mix of **video editing** and **gaming**.\n\n\n\nMy Current Specs:\n\n\n\nCPU: **Ryzen 5 4600G**\n\nGPU: **GALAX GeForce RTX™ 3060 Ti**\n\nRAM: 1x Lexar Thor 16GB DDR4 3200MHz CL16 (i am planning to add another one of the same ram this week if i stay am4)\n\nMotherboard: **Gigabyte A520M K V2**\n\nPSU: **Inplay GS 550W** (I know this is **bad**, it's my top priority to replace first!)\n\nThe **Ryzen 5 4600G** is a real **hindrance right now** and is **bottlenecking** my 3060 Ti hard in both editing and gaming.\n\nFor gaming, I got the 3060 Ti for a great price, and I know it can perform well at 1080p, which is all I'm targeting. I mostly play lighter esports titles, but I also love heavy AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077, Dying Light 2, Outer Worlds 2, Arc Raiders, and Battlefield 6.\n\nAs a perfect example, **in Cyberpunk 2077, I get 50-60 FPS whether I'm on Ultra settings or the absolute Lowest settings, even with DLSS on.** It's a clear sign my CPU is holding me back, and it's super frustrating.\n\n**Option 1: The AM4 Path**\n\n\n\nCPU: **Ryzen 7 5700X**\n\nMotherboard: **MSI B550M Pro VDH**\n\nRAM: **Add a matching 16GB 3200MHz stick (for 32GB total)**\n\nPSU: **A new, quality 650W-750W PSU**\n\nThis seems like the **cheaper**, more **immediate upgrade**.\n\n\n\n**Option 2: The AM5 Path**\n\n\n\nCPU: **Ryzen 7 7700**\n\nMotherboard: **An Asus B650M-AYW WIFI DDR5 PCIe 5.0 M.2**\n\nRAM: **New 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 6000MHz kit**\n\nPSU: **A new, quality 650W-750W PSU**\n\n\n\nMy Dilemma\n\n\n\n**AM5** is obviously more future-proof, but it's s**ignificantly more expensive**. I feel like I'm a bit late to the PC building scene.\n\nI can wait a few more months to save up for the AM5 parts, but my current **PC's performance** is very **frustrating** to deal with right now and it **hinders my editing** workloads, and **especially gaming**.\n\nIs the performance jump to AM5 **worth the extra cost** and the wait? Or is the 5700X upgrade on **AM4 a smart, budget-friendly choice** that will hold me over for the next few years?\n\nWhat would you do in my position? Thanks!",

I prefer default settings at 2400 (less headache). Should I go for 2400 mhz instead? I saw online someone using 3200 and it defaulted to 2600 and gave him a blue screen but I'm not sure if I understood everything. How can ram be down clocked to 2600 when default is set at 2400 mhz?\n\n2)  Today I added a NVMe and wanted to install windows OS on it. But PC crashed at splash logo due bios 2.0 being too old. Will Sata SDD work instead? I can't upgrade bios without upgrading CPU \n\n  \n3) if I want to upgrade CPU, which would be the \"best\" for this mobo without too much mod? Is there a \"plug and play\" cpu that i can just add and not worry about anything breaking? are there any limitations? ie need to improve PSU, need more RAM, etc \n\nPlease help!

    "selftext": "edit:  It seems the consensus is that the X3D isn't going to provide value \\*in my use case\\*.  Thanks for your replies!\n\n\n\nI'm currently pricing up a server to run multiplayer games like Conan, Minecraft & 7 days.  My plan is to run proxmox and have two VMs, one linux and one win11pro (for games w/o linux server software).  I understand that most game servers are single threaded so I should look to a faster clock than number of cores.\n\n**Is it worth getting a Ryzen CPU with X3D?**  Will it benefit an effectively headless server?  The sale pitch says the 3D cache is great for single threaded games but I suspect that's only relevant to rendering games, which won't happen on the server obviously.  For comparison, a 9900X is $230 cheaper for me than a 9900X3D.  I expect that will also hold true for the 8 and 12 core chips.\n\nThanks",

Frames are really important to me, I get agitated if it goes under 100fps (I know. I'm a snob. Sue me.)\n\nMy heart wants to go with the 9800x3d but if it's literally pointless because it will cause a GPU bottleneck, is that a stupid decision? Will I get any benefits from the 9800x3d over the 7800x3d? \n\nI've been PC gaming for about 5+ years now but I'm still a bit of a novice when it comes to the hardware and stuff so any advice would be appreciated.",

I've tried reseat the ram, reseat the cpu, psu, and even upgrading the bios. Same thing just the red led on the cpu. Then lucky me i managed to claim a waranty for the cpu unit, and got the replacement today.\n\nJust want to let you all know, im not so sure if it was a faulty cpu, or m/b that causing the dead of the cpu, i never did any overclocking, undervolt or anything to the cpu, im just enabling PBO and running bios 3.26 until then. The cpu was running fine and I didnot update the bios (but i did when the first setup). \n\nThere was no any physical damage to cpu nor the m/b, like a burnt mark or any scratches. So as for right now im scared to enable pbo in the bios and will let it run at 4800mhz coz i need this rig for my work. \n\nGiving failed cpu issue on asrock m/b right now like the 9800x3d, make me uneasy and should i replace my motherboard guys? Anyone have the same issue with 9700x? Or maybe any suggestion to make this cpu runs well and last\n\n\n\n",

I also had to get Corsair RAM from Best buy, even though I'm pretty biased toward G.Skill, since the DDR5 I actually want is inflated so high. It's not what I wanted. It is 6000, but it's only 32GB and it's CL is 36 instead of 30. I'll probably return it honestly. But other than that, I wanted to ask if anyone who has used this AIO cooler has had any issues with USB power delivery. It is causing some intermittent weird issues with my ports.

When searching online other's CPU seems to hover at a much lower temp under load (60-70C).\n\nBelow are the stats monitored using HWiNFO when unpacking files and playing CPU intensive games (e.g POE2, Cyberpunk).\n\nHardware/Case: 9800x3D, Artic Liquid Freezer III Pro 360, Fractal North XL\n\nFan setup (might be using the wrong jargon): CPU cooler radiator mounted at top, 3 front stock fans\n\nAmbient temp: 27C\n\n**CPU temp:** constant 90C\n\n**Clock speed:** Hovers around 5.1-5.2MHz\n\n**Voltage:** Hovers around 1.2-1.28v\n\n**Cinebench** **score:** 1319\n\nDo explain like I'm five as I really want to learn and hopefully in the future I would be brave and knowledgeable enough to build a PC instead of buying from vendor and getting paranoid. Some follow-up questions I have:\n\n1. If the above temperatures are safe, is it possible to achieve lower temperatures at same performance by improving air flow etc.? I can post pictures of the set-up if required.\n\n  \nEdit: Thank you for the kind insights. I will have to check back with the vendor and update again when I have time.",

I think gaming rage comes from a lack of control. \n\nYou can control how YOU play. Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system. Notice how a lot of competitive games are labeled as \"toxic\"? Its because people are always blaming others.\n\nI can't think of a single time where I hard raged in a single player game. Why? Because I know that my perfomance is directly related the only variable; me. \n\nSorry for the yap. Was pooping on the toliet and just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\n",

    "selftext": "*Amazon.com Inc. is gutting its video-game division as part of a sweeping layoff that will eliminate more than 14,000 corporate jobs.*\n\n*The company didn’t say how many roles it will cut in the video-game unit, but noted in a memo to staff on Tuesday that the cuts would largely fall on its offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well at its central publishing division. The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs.*\n\n*“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” wrote Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Games, in an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg News.*",

    "selftext": "Seven years ago I had this idea for an underwater PvP survival game. No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ≠ skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \n🎮 Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

    "selftext": "I picked it up yesterday to play with my friends for the first time. I was surprised (in a positive way) at how mechanicaly complex it can be, especially the organizing and reparing the RV part of the game. It seems like the type of game that it's both fun and exciting to master in the long run, BUT I was astonished at how bad it overall works. To the point of taking you out of the immersion multiple times.\n\n\\- This is a physics-based game in which the physics barely work. The rope, the constantly clipping in and out of the RV, the weird collision issues... it's everywhere.\n\n\\- This is a pity, but there's barely a sense of danger or stakes whatosever. From time to time an animal will attack, or there will be a terrain obstacle to overcome, but that's pretty much it. In a way it's cool, this can be a calmer game that, let's say, Peak or REPO. But it also means that in the moment to moment gameplay it can sometimes be somewhat boring, especially because--\n\n\\- This is one of my biggest complaints right now. The multiplayer of this game i feel is not balanced. There were four of us in the RV, and for most of the time, it feels like the game would have worked better with just two. It didn't seem to me like there was much to be done. The person driving has such and advantage mechanically, and there can also be a person looking at the map, but other than that, this is not a Sea of Theves type of thing were EVERY person is needed to manouver the boat. The other two of us were just in the back, seated because you can NOT be walking around the RV while someone's driving because the physics turn crazy. That means it's not a time that you can spend maybe organising the cabinets, playing cards (this is not a mechanic but it would be cool) or something like that.\n\nI want to end on a positive note. Like I said, I really love the premise of the game. It's so unique and full of potential (the chain-smoking is hilarious). If it was well polished and with expanded mechanics, this could be like a land version of Sea of Thieves. But right now is everything but polished. It's so bizarre to me that this is a 1.0 release and not an early access.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe’ve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It’s a fast, chaotic beat ’em up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who’s Mexican, and it’s directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt’s basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It’s been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo’s now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We’ve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that’s part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I’ll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pokémon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

In battle, you can deploy units alongside you (and give them orders via a tactical pause, if you want), and on a macro level you will seamlessly manage resources, supply lines, capture and defend locations, build structures, and more on a constantly evolving (in real time) strategic map. The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs.*\n\n*“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” wrote Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Games, in an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg News.*",

    "selftext": "Seven years ago I had this idea for an underwater PvP survival game. No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe’ve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It’s a fast, chaotic beat ’em up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who’s Mexican, and it’s directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt’s basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It’s been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo’s now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We’ve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that’s part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I’ll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system. Notice how a lot of competitive games are labeled as \"toxic\"? Its because people are always blaming others.\n\nI can't think of a single time where I hard raged in a single player game. Why?

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ≠ skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \n🎮 Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs.*\n\n*“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” wrote Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Games, in an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg News.*",

    "selftext": "Seven years ago I had this idea for an underwater PvP survival game. No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "To preface this, I left my apartment for around a week. When I left, my PC was working with no issues. I come back, and when I turned on my PC all the hardware came on, then immediately turned off. On my MOBO it went from the DRAM light to the CPU light, and immediately turned off.\n\nI originally thought this was a PSU problem, and bought a new power supply (Corsair CX750M -> RM850x) Of course, no dice.\n\nI then checked my ram, and swapped it with a spare stick I had. Still the same problem. Then I thought it had to be the motherboard then, and I swapped my MOBO for the same model (Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX). Again, same problem.\n\nMy last ditch thought was that it could be a CPU problem, and I swapped my CPU for a new Ryzen 7 7800x3d. Once again, did not fix the problem.\n\nAt this point, I was just completely lost. I tried unplugging all my case’s headers, like the front panel, audio, and USB connectors. I then started the PC by shorting the power on pins with a screwdriver. The PC actually stayed on this time, but did not boot.\n\nA couple things I also tried was booting without the GPU. After this, I tried plugging the PC into different outlets to make sure it wasn’t just an outlet problem. Both of course did not work.\n\nThe MOBO light sequence started at DRAM, stayed there for around 20 seconds, went to VGA which instantly cleared, then went back to CPU where it stayed on with no boot or display.\n\nMy last ditch effort was thinking there was some sort of short here, and bought a NZXT internal USB hub. I kept this the only thing connected to MOBO usb wise, with again no case connectors. I plugged my AIO USB into here. Originally when I gave it SATA power, the radiator fans and GPU LEDS stayed permanently on, and when it went from VGA to CPU the PC would shut off and then not start again until I unplugged the PSU.\n\nThis led me to try once with it connected to the hub but giving it no SATA power once to the same result as before with it staying on the CPU light and not booting, but also not shutting off. I did that once then just plugged the AIO back into one of the mobos USB connectors to the same result.\n\nI tried multiple times reapplying the AIO pump to make sure it was getting even pressure and wasn’t overtightened. All of this has not worked, and now here I am.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas or knows what’s going on it would be well appreciated.\n\nMy build: NZXT H5 Flow Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX (swapped for same board) RTX 2080 Ryzen 7 7700x -> Ryzen 7 7800x3d (swapped) NZXT Kraken 360 Corsair CX750M -> Corsair RM850x 32gb Crucial DDR5 5600MHz x2 16 sticks Samsung 990 Pro",

The person who posted on Quasarzone kept modifying the content of the post while demanding compensation, then eventually withdrew the demands and left.\n\n[original link(dcinside SFF Gallery)](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=sff&no=1456811)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odpdxzea4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=c906d10a7957c8ebb74b370bed42c54227e8e8eb\n\nFig. 1. MSDS of SGT-4 posted on the AMeCh homepage Most thermal-paste products use polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, often called \"silicone oil\") as a dispersing medium, and disperse heat-transfer media such as Al2O3 (alumina). I confirmed from the attached photo that SGT-4 also uses PDMS and alumina, etc. But in the issue raised by Igor Lab, the ingredient causing the sour smell was suggested to be acetoxy silicone (acetoxy silane), and AMeCh asserted that it is not. So I treated the question of whether acetoxy silane was added to SGT-4 as the point of contention, and I did an analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mje10mdt5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=fed09c9f69e2b172fbf14e473bd56495f4e455d8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vue0nw6g4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bbf92d1120d32a163ff499d6465d1a1fb43b88d\n\nFig. 2. a) photo of SGT-4 separated by centrifuge using nhexane as solvent, b) after removing organic layer with rotary evaporator First, since PDMS or acetoxy silane are both organics, in order to extract the organic matter from SGT-4 I used a centrifuge to separate out the organic layer; in the filtering process I used a 0.2 µm syringe filter to catch any inorganic particles that might have gotten in. Then I evaporated the filtered solution to isolate the organic matter inside SGT-4 alone, and did 1H NMR measurement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mc36gmru5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=57ee11762c1e4e4a8075185c565e344efcbea7d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxffrg6j4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=8028a8d52024fb35e705f19eb5f6cd57d375723d\n\nFig. 3. a) certificate of the PDMS measured as control, b) NMR spectrum of that sample If you studied organic chemistry you know roughly what NMR is: hydrogen atoms in organics are influenced by nearby atoms and take particular positions and shapes in the spectrum, and the integrated area of each peak is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms - so you can infer structure from it. As shown in the certificate in Fig. 3, the PDMS in question has a terminal -OH group accounting for 1.4% by mass; interpreting together with the NMR result: since the spectrum is measured relative to TMS as standard, given PDMS with Si-CH3 bonded to the Si atoms, we expect a peak very close to 0 ppm from Si-CH3, and at 2.12 ppm we measured the broad -OH peak characteristic of the terminal -OH. Because the terminal OH mass ratio is 1.4%, if you reversecalculate the ratio of OH: CH3 integration, you get roughly 98 : 1 - considering it is a polymer NMR this is reasonably consistent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptta1gvl4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=727b31f1ac87443d8f8e2fdc7b8b53c0ed5dcf12\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si6zd69m4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=5646b1b6511ee2e567794d1a5bd0cb3f74f63ea5\n\nFig. 4. NMR spectrum of organic matter extracted from SGT-4 Now let's look at the SGT-4 result. The reason I posted two spectra is that the CH3 peak is so distinct that minor peaks get buried in it unless you zoom in. Compared to the control, there appear to be many small peaks. That's because in NMR the peak intensity is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms being measured; even if it's a mixture, if one hydrogen atom type is detected a lot then the remaining hydrogen types inevitably appear relatively small. Anyway, in the result we observe, just like in the control, a prominent Si-CH3 peak is detected, and the remaining peaks are likely due to additives, or possibly the PDMS used is not a typical linear structure but something branched or otherwise modified - there are various possibilities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yuj1u4p4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bfeeea4330e1e66be2edf9583bde10f0f84fc4c\n\nFig. 5. Molecular structures of various kinds of acetoxy silanes However, if you look at the structure of acetoxy silane, they commonly share an acetyloxy group (O=C-CH3). The CH3 of that functional group is characterized by a peak around \\~2.0 ppm. I enlarged it quite a bit but I did not observe a peak in that region. Now you might argue \"Well if acetoxy silane is included in a very small amount then it might not be detectable by NMR, right?\" But in the first place, if something is present only to the point where you can't see it on NMR, is that amount enough to give off a detectable smell when it oxidizes and humans smell it? That's what I wonder.\n\nConclusion: In the sample I measured, I did not see the 1H proton peak attributable to the acetyloxy group of acetoxy silane. Even if an extremely small amount was added and not detected, I'm of the opinion that at this level of non-detection it would be hard for humans to even smell it in the first place. I'm not sure whether I will additionally measure IR or DSC at the current stage.\n\n\\-> A full translation of original report by dcinside sff gallery user\n\nFurthermore -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tdyrp8z4zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a396337027b01b8f556aa757c1ca2c77719b97f\n\nBusiness registration certificate (Amech)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2rqem655zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=666112fd0b760afeff4b1e4547230c3bf0ecb71a\n\noffice(a apartment style factory/지식산업센터), Room 504\n\n경상북도 포항시 북구 흥해읍 융합기술로 66, 504(포항지식산업센터)\n\n[Road View](https://map.naver.com/p/search/%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,%20504%28%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%A7%80%EC%8B%9D%EC%82%B0%EC%97%85%EC%84%BC%ED%84%B0%29/address/14395620.4671225,4309151.0136731,%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,new?c=18.01,0,0,0,adh&isCorrectAnswer=true&p=hqnmZMQfY2hmxuyOb5DYsw,-119.09,11.82,80,Float) \\- naver maps",

This build definitely took a while with just the side panels alone taking 8 hours to draw all the decorative lines with a paint pen. Anytime I accidentally touched the pen to the edge of the stencil, it would bleed under a bit and I had to come back after peeling off the stencil decal with a q tip and rubbing alcohol and clean up all the lines lol. It was worth it though and I’m really happy with the result!\n\nEdit: this is a reup because I forgot to add the video to my original post like an idiot\nFor those wondering about the rest of the specs, it has a Ryzen 7 7800x3D, Powercolor RX 9070xt Hellhound Spectral White, Aorus B850M Elite WiFi Ice, 32gb 6000MHz Patriot Viper DDR5, Klevv 2tb m.2, Montech PLA 750w PSU",

I changed it to 802.11ac and the speeds immediately returned to the 100s/200s. Not sure when that was turned off, but that seems to be the fix for it.\n\n**TLDR:** My wifi has slowed a lot and I think it might be my \"older\" wifi adapter. [Archer TX50E](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/pci-adapter/archer-tx50e/)\n\nI built this PC about 3 years ago and everything has been fine up until recently when my internet speeds have tanked. I used to have at least 100 Mbps and sometimes into the 150s, but the last few weeks it wont even hit 20 Mbps most of the time, the highest I've seen is like 23. All of my drivers are up to date and the internet itself has good speeds. A PC that's been hardwired to the router has the same high speeds it always had and my phone hits 250 Mbps without fail. This is all when I don't have anything heavy running, like a big download or anything like that. When I try downloading a game it now takes forever and even just browsing comes to almost a standstill. I'm thinking that the wifi adapter I have is too \"old\", as the website says it's **\"end of life\".** What would be the best way of fixing it; some download I haven't heard of, a new wifi adapter, or just hardwiring(last option due to having to run wires through the wall)?",

I fixed that so the computer posted.\n\nAfterwards, I started having issues with booting. The computer essentially would run, no post or bios flashing on the screen but the fans and lights were on. It was stuck on this screen for minutes. I would then cycle power a few times (switching it off on the PSU) and after 3rd time it would let me into Windows.\n\nSometimes, (e.g. 2-3rd boot loop round) my motherboard will show the red LED, pointing to some issue with mobo. Cycling after that usually lets me into Windows.\n\nI didnt know whats going on so I ran DDU again, and that didnt help. So I hoped for best and restored the PC to a previous point. It seems that NVIDIA drivers were no longer there anyway, so I installed AMD drivers and didn't dare to turn it off again.\n\nHowever, after each shut down I have to do the power cycle process about 3 times each time before the PC let's me in. Otherwise it turns on, but is on black screen with fans running. Can you tell me whats wrong? Im at my wits end and at least I can boot into Windows, but doing this dance each time I want to use my PC feels awful.

It was fine last night when I went to bed, but today I noticed my computer was on and when I checked, it was in BIOS for some reason. I went to restart and it popped me right back into bios, won’t boot windows. It is detecting both my boot drive and secondary drive. I tried spamming F8 on launch to boot into safe mode and got a bios message saying “please select boot drive” with a drop down menu, however there were no drives in the drop down menu. but when i go to the “boot” tab in bios, my boot sequence and boot drive are detected. I have tried resetting CMOS, reseating the drive, and changing the M2 slot. I also ensured all other internals are seated properly and yet still i am stuck on the BIOS screen. Also ensured my RAM is set to correct speed in bios as well.\n\nI have had the computer for almost 4 years or so, and upgraded to windows 11 just last month, I had to enable secure boot as well the FTPM and enabled UEFI in order to upgrade but didn’t have any issues until just today, it had been running windows 11 just fine for over a month.\n\nNot sure if it’s relevant or not, but for a couple months, every time i restarted my computer or turned it on from a shutdown, i would get a “scanning and repairing drive C ” message shown from windows but i just assumed it was from a mod i was running for a game that sometimes delayed my shutdown for a second during the shutdown process. \n\nCan anyone please help? I am at a complete loss, Google is no help and i have searched the subreddit and can’t find anyone else with this issue.",

I asked him why it was so hot and he said he was cold and cranked the heat up. \n\nI acclimated to my offices Tattooine like climate to find my PC still running the opening load screen to battlefield. I have a little thermometer hanging in my PC case and it was reading 120°F. I shut it down completely and turned the air conditioner on full blast in hopes that Hoth will be better to get her cooled down. \n\nDo yall think my bf cooked my PC?

The remaining 17.76% users either have a videocard other than these, or the cards were not specifically registered in the survey.\n* Each histogram bin represents a 2000 G3D mark, starting from 0-2000 for the first bin, up to 38000-40000 for the last bin, making a total of 20 bars.\n* Most popular high-end card is **RTX 4070** at **2.16%.**\n* Most popular mid-range card are **RTX 3060** at **4.41%** and **RTX 4060 Laptop** at **4.84%**\n* Most popular low-end card are **GTX 1650** at **3.02%** and **RTX 3050** at **3.07%**\n* Most popular potato card is **GTX 1050** at **0.71%**.\n\nEDIT: 5070 and RX 580 are repeated twice.

    "selftext": "Summary\n\n* The product does not contain acetoxy silicone.\n* The product is manufactured in South Korea.\n* The company is currently in operation, and its address has been verified.\n* The company is discussing on verification methods, and exploring possible laboratory tests through certified testing institutions.\n* So, most of the claims made against this product and the company are false.\n\nThe company is a sole proprietorship and is at risk of suspending operations due to this incident. According to the supplier, the product was essentially sold with no profit margin.\n\nThey have neither the assets nor the means to defend themselves, so we are responding on their behalf. There is no issue with this product. The person who posted on Quasarzone kept modifying the content of the post while demanding compensation, then eventually withdrew the demands and left.\n\n[original link(dcinside SFF Gallery)](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=sff&no=1456811)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odpdxzea4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=c906d10a7957c8ebb74b370bed42c54227e8e8eb\n\nFig. 1. MSDS of SGT-4 posted on the AMeCh homepage Most thermal-paste products use polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, often called \"silicone oil\") as a dispersing medium, and disperse heat-transfer media such as Al2O3 (alumina). I confirmed from the attached photo that SGT-4 also uses PDMS and alumina, etc. But in the issue raised by Igor Lab, the ingredient causing the sour smell was suggested to be acetoxy silicone (acetoxy silane), and AMeCh asserted that it is not. So I treated the question of whether acetoxy silane was added to SGT-4 as the point of contention, and I did an analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mje10mdt5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=fed09c9f69e2b172fbf14e473bd56495f4e455d8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vue0nw6g4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bbf92d1120d32a163ff499d6465d1a1fb43b88d\n\nFig. 2. a) photo of SGT-4 separated by centrifuge using nhexane as solvent, b) after removing organic layer with rotary evaporator First, since PDMS or acetoxy silane are both organics, in order to extract the organic matter from SGT-4 I used a centrifuge to separate out the organic layer; in the filtering process I used a 0.2 µm syringe filter to catch any inorganic particles that might have gotten in. Then I evaporated the filtered solution to isolate the organic matter inside SGT-4 alone, and did 1H NMR measurement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mc36gmru5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=57ee11762c1e4e4a8075185c565e344efcbea7d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxffrg6j4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=8028a8d52024fb35e705f19eb5f6cd57d375723d\n\nFig. 3. a) certificate of the PDMS measured as control, b) NMR spectrum of that sample If you studied organic chemistry you know roughly what NMR is: hydrogen atoms in organics are influenced by nearby atoms and take particular positions and shapes in the spectrum, and the integrated area of each peak is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms - so you can infer structure from it. As shown in the certificate in Fig. 3, the PDMS in question has a terminal -OH group accounting for 1.4% by mass; interpreting together with the NMR result: since the spectrum is measured relative to TMS as standard, given PDMS with Si-CH3 bonded to the Si atoms, we expect a peak very close to 0 ppm from Si-CH3, and at 2.12 ppm we measured the broad -OH peak characteristic of the terminal -OH. Because the terminal OH mass ratio is 1.4%, if you reversecalculate the ratio of OH: CH3 integration, you get roughly 98 : 1 - considering it is a polymer NMR this is reasonably consistent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptta1gvl4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=727b31f1ac87443d8f8e2fdc7b8b53c0ed5dcf12\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si6zd69m4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=5646b1b6511ee2e567794d1a5bd0cb3f74f63ea5\n\nFig. 4. NMR spectrum of organic matter extracted from SGT-4 Now let's look at the SGT-4 result. The reason I posted two spectra is that the CH3 peak is so distinct that minor peaks get buried in it unless you zoom in. Compared to the control, there appear to be many small peaks. That's because in NMR the peak intensity is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms being measured; even if it's a mixture, if one hydrogen atom type is detected a lot then the remaining hydrogen types inevitably appear relatively small. Anyway, in the result we observe, just like in the control, a prominent Si-CH3 peak is detected, and the remaining peaks are likely due to additives, or possibly the PDMS used is not a typical linear structure but something branched or otherwise modified - there are various possibilities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yuj1u4p4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bfeeea4330e1e66be2edf9583bde10f0f84fc4c\n\nFig. 5. Molecular structures of various kinds of acetoxy silanes However, if you look at the structure of acetoxy silane, they commonly share an acetyloxy group (O=C-CH3). The CH3 of that functional group is characterized by a peak around \\~2.0 ppm. I enlarged it quite a bit but I did not observe a peak in that region. Now you might argue \"Well if acetoxy silane is included in a very small amount then it might not be detectable by NMR, right?\" But in the first place, if something is present only to the point where you can't see it on NMR, is that amount enough to give off a detectable smell when it oxidizes and humans smell it? That's what I wonder.\n\nConclusion: In the sample I measured, I did not see the 1H proton peak attributable to the acetyloxy group of acetoxy silane. Even if an extremely small amount was added and not detected, I'm of the opinion that at this level of non-detection it would be hard for humans to even smell it in the first place. I'm not sure whether I will additionally measure IR or DSC at the current stage.\n\n\\-> A full translation of original report by dcinside sff gallery user\n\nFurthermore -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tdyrp8z4zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a396337027b01b8f556aa757c1ca2c77719b97f\n\nBusiness registration certificate (Amech)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2rqem655zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=666112fd0b760afeff4b1e4547230c3bf0ecb71a\n\noffice(a apartment style factory/지식산업센터), Room 504\n\n경상북도 포항시 북구 흥해읍 융합기술로 66, 504(포항지식산업센터)\n\n[Road View](https://map.naver.com/p/search/%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,%20504%28%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%A7%80%EC%8B%9D%EC%82%B0%EC%97%85%EC%84%BC%ED%84%B0%29/address/14395620.4671225,4309151.0136731,%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,new?c=18.01,0,0,0,adh&isCorrectAnswer=true&p=hqnmZMQfY2hmxuyOb5DYsw,-119.09,11.82,80,Float) \\- naver maps",

I haven’t tested it yet because I’m planning to replace the PSU with a native 16-pin (600 W) GPU cable, as that was the recommended solution.\n\nAnyways, I wanted to express my gratitude to MSI for their exceptional service. I initiated the RMA on October 15th, and it was shipped out the same day. I got a confirmation email for receiving the GPU on October 20th, and I finally received the new card today, October 28th. Overall, the process was super efficient, taking less than a month. The only minor inconvenience was the cost of shipping and insurance. However, MSI clearly stated in the RMA that they do not cover these expenses. ",

They look so great together in this build and they’re definitely worth checking out if you’re looking for something unique that won’t break the bank. This build definitely took a while with just the side panels alone taking 8 hours to draw all the decorative lines with a paint pen. Anytime I accidentally touched the pen to the edge of the stencil, it would bleed under a bit and I had to come back after peeling off the stencil decal with a q tip and rubbing alcohol and clean up all the lines lol. It was worth it though and I’m really happy with the result!\n\nEdit: this is a reup because I forgot to add the video to my original post like an idiot\nFor those wondering about the rest of the specs, it has a Ryzen 7 7800x3D, Powercolor RX 9070xt Hellhound Spectral White, Aorus B850M Elite WiFi Ice, 32gb 6000MHz Patriot Viper DDR5, Klevv 2tb m.2, Montech PLA 750w PSU",

Maybe it would have been a better transition if they didn't confusingly release the first desktop processors on the second generation, and also have a completely different line of processors simply called \"Intel Core\" on the side? Really makes me want to go with AMD for my next processor because of their good reputation and a naming scheme that makes sense.",

Should I drop $100-150 on a new PSU rated B or higher, or do you think this PSU proved itself and I'm fine?\n\nMy PSU is the [Antec CSK 550W Bronze](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/Vqt9TW/antec-csk-550-w-80-bronze-certified-atx-power-supply-csk550)\n\nIf I upgrade, it'll most likely be something like the [Gigabyte UD750GM Gold](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/W4Tp99/gigabyte-ud750gm-750-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-gp-ud750gm)",

MSDS of SGT-4 posted on the AMeCh homepage Most thermal-paste products use polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, often called \"silicone oil\") as a dispersing medium, and disperse heat-transfer media such as Al2O3 (alumina). I confirmed from the attached photo that SGT-4 also uses PDMS and alumina, etc. But in the issue raised by Igor Lab, the ingredient causing the sour smell was suggested to be acetoxy silicone (acetoxy silane), and AMeCh asserted that it is not. So I treated the question of whether acetoxy silane was added to SGT-4 as the point of contention, and I did an analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mje10mdt5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=fed09c9f69e2b172fbf14e473bd56495f4e455d8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vue0nw6g4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bbf92d1120d32a163ff499d6465d1a1fb43b88d\n\nFig. 2. a) photo of SGT-4 separated by centrifuge using nhexane as solvent, b) after removing organic layer with rotary evaporator First, since PDMS or acetoxy silane are both organics, in order to extract the organic matter from SGT-4 I used a centrifuge to separate out the organic layer; in the filtering process I used a 0.2 µm syringe filter to catch any inorganic particles that might have gotten in. Then I evaporated the filtered solution to isolate the organic matter inside SGT-4 alone, and did 1H NMR measurement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mc36gmru5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=57ee11762c1e4e4a8075185c565e344efcbea7d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxffrg6j4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=8028a8d52024fb35e705f19eb5f6cd57d375723d\n\nFig. 3. a) certificate of the PDMS measured as control, b) NMR spectrum of that sample If you studied organic chemistry you know roughly what NMR is: hydrogen atoms in organics are influenced by nearby atoms and take particular positions and shapes in the spectrum, and the integrated area of each peak is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms - so you can infer structure from it. As shown in the certificate in Fig. 3, the PDMS in question has a terminal -OH group accounting for 1.4% by mass; interpreting together with the NMR result: since the spectrum is measured relative to TMS as standard, given PDMS with Si-CH3 bonded to the Si atoms, we expect a peak very close to 0 ppm from Si-CH3, and at 2.12 ppm we measured the broad -OH peak characteristic of the terminal -OH. Because the terminal OH mass ratio is 1.4%, if you reversecalculate the ratio of OH: CH3 integration, you get roughly 98 : 1 - considering it is a polymer NMR this is reasonably consistent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptta1gvl4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=727b31f1ac87443d8f8e2fdc7b8b53c0ed5dcf12\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si6zd69m4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=5646b1b6511ee2e567794d1a5bd0cb3f74f63ea5\n\nFig. 4. NMR spectrum of organic matter extracted from SGT-4 Now let's look at the SGT-4 result. The reason I posted two spectra is that the CH3 peak is so distinct that minor peaks get buried in it unless you zoom in. Compared to the control, there appear to be many small peaks. That's because in NMR the peak intensity is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms being measured; even if it's a mixture, if one hydrogen atom type is detected a lot then the remaining hydrogen types inevitably appear relatively small. Anyway, in the result we observe, just like in the control, a prominent Si-CH3 peak is detected, and the remaining peaks are likely due to additives, or possibly the PDMS used is not a typical linear structure but something branched or otherwise modified - there are various possibilities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yuj1u4p4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bfeeea4330e1e66be2edf9583bde10f0f84fc4c\n\nFig. 5. Molecular structures of various kinds of acetoxy silanes However, if you look at the structure of acetoxy silane, they commonly share an acetyloxy group (O=C-CH3). The CH3 of that functional group is characterized by a peak around \\~2.0 ppm. I enlarged it quite a bit but I did not observe a peak in that region. Now you might argue \"Well if acetoxy silane is included in a very small amount then it might not be detectable by NMR, right?\" But in the first place, if something is present only to the point where you can't see it on NMR, is that amount enough to give off a detectable smell when it oxidizes and humans smell it? That's what I wonder.\n\nConclusion: In the sample I measured, I did not see the 1H proton peak attributable to the acetyloxy group of acetoxy silane. Even if an extremely small amount was added and not detected, I'm of the opinion that at this level of non-detection it would be hard for humans to even smell it in the first place. I'm not sure whether I will additionally measure IR or DSC at the current stage.\n\n\\-> A full translation of original report by dcinside sff gallery user\n\nFurthermore -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tdyrp8z4zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a396337027b01b8f556aa757c1ca2c77719b97f\n\nBusiness registration certificate (Amech)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2rqem655zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=666112fd0b760afeff4b1e4547230c3bf0ecb71a\n\noffice(a apartment style factory/지식산업센터), Room 504\n\n경상북도 포항시 북구 흥해읍 융합기술로 66, 504(포항지식산업센터)\n\n[Road View](https://map.naver.com/p/search/%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,%20504%28%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%A7%80%EC%8B%9D%EC%82%B0%EC%97%85%EC%84%BC%ED%84%B0%29/address/14395620.4671225,4309151.0136731,%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,new?c=18.01,0,0,0,adh&isCorrectAnswer=true&p=hqnmZMQfY2hmxuyOb5DYsw,-119.09,11.82,80,Float) \\- naver maps",

I haven’t tested it yet because I’m planning to replace the PSU with a native 16-pin (600 W) GPU cable, as that was the recommended solution.\n\nAnyways, I wanted to express my gratitude to MSI for their exceptional service. I initiated the RMA on October 15th, and it was shipped out the same day. I got a confirmation email for receiving the GPU on October 20th, and I finally received the new card today, October 28th. Overall, the process was super efficient, taking less than a month. The only minor inconvenience was the cost of shipping and insurance. However, MSI clearly stated in the RMA that they do not cover these expenses. ",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

    "selftext": "https://reddit.com/link/1ohqnll/video/3yg1upjhypxf1/player\n\nI made my first switch customization to my ZSA Moonlander Mark 1, and I love it. I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

I've paired the build with a purple and green Owlab Voice Mini, and MW Fright Night deskmat. \n\nThere's nothing better than combining multiple multiple purchases into one solid theme.

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks — band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast 🙂.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me — in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn’t make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they’ll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly — The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay’s voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away → Roxette**  \nI’m still in love with Marie Fredriksson’s voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 → Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele — the man, the music, the attitude — pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F → Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The “3” also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit — Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 → 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it’s probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive →** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt’s pure freedom, soul, happiness — life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins… and hopefully Bart’s story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy — build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power → N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote “tuurnn” next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in — just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane →** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane — the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations →** had to be here anyway, but this one’s a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song’s energy, Mark’s wild teenage years, his early work — all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we’re at it…\n\n**P.I.J M.M → Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite — the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE → Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come Through* would’ve been too many “dreams” — and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire → Scooter (HP Baxxter’s voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in Pécs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously — the best element!\n\n**Out of Space → The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under “Space”, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune’s “I was sent to outer space,” and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can’t Stop Raving* didn’t fit anymore 😅.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True →** basically the slogan of the ’90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven’t outgrown it — and honestly, “growing up” was never my strong suit 🙂.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? →** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I’ve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here — sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** — doesn’t need explaining, but I shouldn’t forget it either.\n* **NRG** — same energy.\n* **Music** — the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** — cliché, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** — probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** — took a while to find. Wanted something that says “I don’t fit in boxes,” kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** — because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** — as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** — one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny “-drive,” because if it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn’t stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches… the works.\n\nThat’s about all that fit — for now.  \nI’ve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer — brush smears the paint, and I don’t want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway… I’ve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the ***Logitech G915 TKL*** and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the *G515* with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the ***Keychron K1 Max*** with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using [launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/) but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use [usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

I've paired the build with a purple and green Owlab Voice Mini, and MW Fright Night deskmat. \n\nThere's nothing better than combining multiple multiple purchases into one solid theme. Best of all both the board and macropad are wireless, which feels appropriate for a Halloween theme keeping everything untethered.\n\nThis is my 6th post that's part of #keebaweek.

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

A simple search via VESA's website does not display this model (or family). I also reached out to Innocn's support, and they admitted it had not been certified. At least they were honest? In the conversation, they stated it is currently not in process either. \n\nHow common is it for monitors to actually get certified after it has already been released? I have only ever seen it prior to release.\n\nHow much does this actually matter?\n\nIs the process to get certified expensive? I know some of their other models do have certifications. \n\nI know monitors can still hit the spec,  just have not been officially certified, but it does not appear to be the case here. According to this video from China, if I am reading this correctly it would be unable to adhere to the spec anyway.

The power button is large and has a white led (not for everyone). The joystick is a decent size that makes it easy to use. The hdr is hdr10. That is customizable from both the windows hdr app and the command center software. \n\nThis monitor is very smooth. On max settings with no dlss in bo6 I am getting the smoothest most responsive game play that was noticable from my previous monitor (hyperx armada 25 240hz/1080p). \n\nThe detail and richness I got from both 8k hdr yt videos and marathon blew my mind. I spent a lot of my matches looking around at details.\nIt comes with dp, hdmi, power and usb b cable.\nIt does come with a adjustable stand but I have monitor arms.\n\nNeutral -  it is very understated, no gamery rgb or stands.  \n\nThe bad - it does have veey obvious glow. The screen is kind of dim in windows when not in hdr content. It's only 320hz and not 380+.\n\n\nOverall - I cannot believe for the price the experience I have with this monitor. It was like hearing music with quality audio but with gaming. This was a better picture than my acer nitro 1440p monitor.\n\nI have wanted alienware monitor for years, I avoided them from youtuber hate. I don't care about tubers opinions anymore.

My question is can I do something about this so that I can watch YouTube videos in 1080p 720p and make it look ok or good?\n\n(Setting the ps5 to 1080p or 720p doesn't help or look better either.)\n\nI'm not very deep into technical spec's so everything helps if you got questions just ask.\n\nThank you",

I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy?

I wanna upgrade to something with a higher resolution as I play a lot of simulators (Farming sim, MSFS and DCS) so probably 1440p or 4K for the stunning graphics. But I also play fps games mostly CS2. Ive been looking but i cant decide. Some people suggest a Ultra wide 4k monitor for msfs. some suggest just a 1440p normal monitor. Curved for immersion but flat for fps games? IDK what to choose. Im planning on after getting the new preferably  it being bigger. I have 40 inches of horizontal space  but Im hoping to DIY my samsung into a vertical monitor by sawing off the stand and rotating it 90°. I dont have a set budget but maybe max high £100 to low £200s. Any suggestions?

I've had it for nearly two years now, and it has been great for me. I know Samsung is not known for their quality when it comes to monitors, but I have had no dead pixels or anything that I can tell, so maybe I just got one of the lucky ones. I just started a new job and I want to treat myself to a new monitor. At first I was looking at getting something of the same size/specs to match, but then I figured why not consider other options as well. \n\nSIZE\n\n* I have a 27in now, but I've been considering a 32in. I think I would appreciate the larger size, but I know that means I may want to consider going to 4k instead of 1440p, and that's a big price jump. \n* Side note: would a 27in next to a 32in might look strange?\n* Also, my current monitor is curved, which wasn't my first choice, but it isn't an aggressive curve and I don't mind it. Why are curved panels less expensive most of the time?\n\nREFRESH RATE\n\n* I am happy with 144hz and above, I can't tell much of a difference past that point. \n\nRESOLUTION\n\n* From my (limited) understanding know you can't always use 120fps and 4k simultaneously, and must choose performance or quality for some applications. I prefer performance gaming to visual quality, but I definitely still want the most out of my system. \n* Also, if I go with a 32in I've heard that 4k is better for screens of that size... If I spend extra money on a 32in monitor is it worth it to go for 4k?\n\nSo does anyone have any recommendations? I want to wait until black friday for some good sales anyways. I'm looking to spend less than $400 but if it's worth it to spend more, I'm willing to do so I'll just want to wait a bit longer and hold out for now.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I’m choosing first monitor 27-inch/1440p, and I’m confused about the choice. Since I have a VA panel TV, I prefer VA, but based on monitor reviews, everyone recommends choosing IPS.\nI went to an store, and they only had the Samsung G5 (curved VA and flat IPS) available. At first glance, they looked the same, but the VA had terrible viewing angles. That's strange—the viewing angles on my TV are great, and I actually replaced it when I first bought an IPS from LG that had horrible black levels and washed-out colors.\nSo, the review from the RTINGS website confused me, where it said: \"Distracting VRR flicker with changing frame rates.\"\nI mainly play CP2077, where I get around 90-120fps, and Warzone, where I get about 140fps.\nHow will the monitor behave at such frame rates? Will there be flickering?\nMy device is a laptop with an RTX 4050.\nAlso, I have a external RX7800. I might build a full PC in the future, but I also hooked it up via M2 just to get some extra FPS. The only thing I'm really concerned about, though, is how games will look when I'm not getting crazy 180Hz frame rates, since I won't hit 180fps+ every game.\n\nI’m also worried about whether it will be possible to watch movies at 24/30 fps on such a monitor. Or will they flicker?\nMy laptop has an IPS panel, and surprisingly, it’s decent, but I have no way to compare it to separate IPS monitors.\nI ordered an AOC Q27G4X (IPS) arriving, but I doubt I should keep it. I’m afraid of getting poor black color/levels. However, all the reviews I've watched for VA monitors mentioned they have very poor viewing angles, ghosting/smearing, slow response, and flicker... and yes, I'm not ready to buy an OLED...",

    "selftext": "Hello,  \nI’ve owned this monitor for about three years now. After about a year of using it on Windows 10, I started getting a “DisplayPort no signal” message when turning the monitor on. Sometimes, it would also happen after quitting fullscreen games — the screen would just go black with “no DP signal.”\n\nTo fix it, I’ve always just unplugged the DisplayPort cable from my PC and plugged it back in, which worked every time. I thought updating to Windows 11 might fix the problem, but it didn’t.\n\nI’ve tried almost everything — a full PC reset, several Windows reinstalls, updating from Windows 10 to 11, updating drivers (both monitor and GPU), updating the monitor’s firmware, changing cables, adjusting monitor settings, and tweaking settings in the NVIDIA Control Panel. Nothing has helped, and the issue still happens to this day.\n\nI’ve looked through multiple forums for a solution but couldn’t find anything that worked. I’ve kind of gotten used to just unplugging the DP cable whenever it happens, but it would be nice if there was a real fix. If anyone knows how to solve it, I’d really appreciate it.\n\n**My setup:**\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 3700X\n* **GPU:** Gainward GeForce RTX 2060 Super Phantom GS (8GB GDDR6)\n* **SSD:** Kingston A2000 M.2 – 500GB\n* **RAM:** ADATA XPG GAMMIX D10 16GB (2×8GB) DDR4 3600 CL18, black\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS PRIME B450-PLUS (AMD B450)\n* **HDD:** Seagate BarraCuda 3.5\" – 1TB\n* **OS:** Windows 11\n\n**Primary Monitor:**\n\n* ASUS TUF GAMING VG27AQL1A\n* Usually running at 120Hz (tried 60Hz — issue persists)\n* Connected via DisplayPort (tried different cables, no change)\n\n**Secondary Monitor:**\n\n* Samsung S24D300\n* 60Hz\n* Connected via HDMI",

I can for sure see the pixel difference between the 2560x1440 and the 1920x1200. \n\nBut I am having mixed feelings on if I should upgrade to a 4k or a 2.5k monitor. If it was 2.5k then ill prob do a Benq SW242Q or another 27\" 2.5k Proart. If I do 4k then all my monitors is 4k but then ill have to bump up to a 4k and all of those start at 27\" min (either Benq or Asus photogarphy monitors) but 27\" takes up a lot of height space being all of those are 16:9 hence my hestancy of 27\" monitors. Another RD280U 3:2 is pretty much a 27\" with more height so that dont solve that problem (though I can just not do the verticle layout in that case)\n\n\nAny suggetions or advice?\n\nEdit: gah typo for title Size -> Side.",

[P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

Well... as you can see, not great. Unfortunately, now that I know it's there I'm seeing it all the time in dark scenes. I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.",

On max settings with no dlss in bo6 I am getting the smoothest most responsive game play that was noticable from my previous monitor (hyperx armada 25 240hz/1080p). \n\nThe detail and richness I got from both 8k hdr yt videos and marathon blew my mind. I spent a lot of my matches looking around at details.\nIt comes with dp, hdmi, power and usb b cable.\nIt does come with a adjustable stand but I have monitor arms.\n\nNeutral -  it is very understated, no gamery rgb or stands.  \n\nThe bad - it does have veey obvious glow. The screen is kind of dim in windows when not in hdr content. It's only 320hz and not 380+.\n\n\nOverall - I cannot believe for the price the experience I have with this monitor. It was like hearing music with quality audio but with gaming. This was a better picture than my acer nitro 1440p monitor.\n\nI have wanted alienware monitor for years, I avoided them from youtuber hate. I don't care about tubers opinions anymore. I am glad I finally got what i wanted.\n\nAlienware killed it with this set up for the price.\n\nPrevious monitors -\n\n(Sceptre 24\"144hz curved va/1080p)\n(Msi 27\" 170hz 1080p ips)\n(Acer nitro 1440p 27\" 165hz)\n(Hyperx armada 25 240hz 1080p 25\")\n\nPc - 7900x +pbo\nZotac solid 5070oc+ oc\n32gb ddr 5 5200mhz ram\n990 pro 2tb \n",

A simple search via VESA's website does not display this model (or family). I also reached out to Innocn's support, and they admitted it had not been certified. At least they were honest? In the conversation, they stated it is currently not in process either. \n\nHow common is it for monitors to actually get certified after it has already been released? I have only ever seen it prior to release.\n\nHow much does this actually matter?\n\nIs the process to get certified expensive? I know some of their other models do have certifications. \n\nI know monitors can still hit the spec,  just have not been officially certified, but it does not appear to be the case here. According to this video from China, if I am reading this correctly it would be unable to adhere to the spec anyway.

Yesterday the resolution randomly switched to 1440x900 and I cannot switch it back, it now says that is the recommended resolution.  I have tried updating the driver through device manager and setting a custom resolution through the AMD driver but neither work.  The research I've done leads me to believe that the solution would be to install a WHQL driver, but the one for this specific model are not available on the ASUS website, and when I have tried third party drivers, it says that it does not contain digital signature information or something like that.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.",

    "selftext": "So I bought a new monitor not so long ago, which runs on 3840x2160 and 120fps and my ps5 is set to 2160p and 60/120fps. Everything looks and plays awesome, high quality etc. if I watch Amazon Prime or Disney+ everything looks amazing too with good quality, \n\nbut if I watch YouTube it looks not so good, I'm guessing that's because the monitor and ps5 are set to 2160p but normal YouTube videos run at 1080p or 720p, so they just forcefully get upscaled and turn out to look not so good. My question is can I do something about this so that I can watch YouTube videos in 1080p 720p and make it look ok or good?\n\n(Setting the ps5 to 1080p or 720p doesn't help or look better either.)\n\nI'm not very deep into technical spec's so everything helps if you got questions just ask.\n\nThank you",

    "selftext": "I currently have a Samsung Odyssey G5 (Curved 27-Inch, 144hz, 1440p).  \nFor what it's worth, I use a NVIDIA RTX 4080 super and an Xbox Series X.\n\nI use it for gaming mostly, and some GIS projects and general productivity. I've had it for nearly two years now, and it has been great for me. I know Samsung is not known for their quality when it comes to monitors, but I have had no dead pixels or anything that I can tell, so maybe I just got one of the lucky ones. I just started a new job and I want to treat myself to a new monitor. At first I was looking at getting something of the same size/specs to match, but then I figured why not consider other options as well. \n\nSIZE\n\n* I have a 27in now, but I've been considering a 32in. I think I would appreciate the larger size, but I know that means I may want to consider going to 4k instead of 1440p, and that's a big price jump. \n* Side note: would a 27in next to a 32in might look strange?\n* Also, my current monitor is curved, which wasn't my first choice, but it isn't an aggressive curve and I don't mind it. Why are curved panels less expensive most of the time?\n\nREFRESH RATE\n\n* I am happy with 144hz and above, I can't tell much of a difference past that point. \n\nRESOLUTION\n\n* From my (limited) understanding know you can't always use 120fps and 4k simultaneously, and must choose performance or quality for some applications. I prefer performance gaming to visual quality, but I definitely still want the most out of my system. \n* Also, if I go with a 32in I've heard that 4k is better for screens of that size... If I spend extra money on a 32in monitor is it worth it to go for 4k?\n\nSo does anyone have any recommendations? I want to wait until black friday for some good sales anyways. I'm looking to spend less than $400 but if it's worth it to spend more, I'm willing to do so I'll just want to wait a bit longer and hold out for now.",

Tried with my macbook too on different resolutions and refresh rates and this is where I'm at now. Ive got it connected to macbook and im at 1080p 120hz is what I have it set to but when the monitor is turned on it is making crackly sparking noises. As if it is sparking and wants to catch fire and/or blow up. So I am not doing anymore testing with it now. Would anyone know if its possible to take apart and inspect and potentially fix it? I dont know when I got it but if I had to guess it would be 2-3 years ago and probably is out of return warranty window so I might be done for with it. \n\n  \nAny help and advice greatly appreciated.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I’m choosing first monitor 27-inch/1440p, and I’m confused about the choice. Since I have a VA panel TV, I prefer VA, but based on monitor reviews, everyone recommends choosing IPS.\nI went to an store, and they only had the Samsung G5 (curved VA and flat IPS) available. At first glance, they looked the same, but the VA had terrible viewing angles. That's strange—the viewing angles on my TV are great, and I actually replaced it when I first bought an IPS from LG that had horrible black levels and washed-out colors.\nSo, the review from the RTINGS website confused me, where it said: \"Distracting VRR flicker with changing frame rates.\"\nI mainly play CP2077, where I get around 90-120fps, and Warzone, where I get about 140fps.\nHow will the monitor behave at such frame rates? Will there be flickering?\nMy device is a laptop with an RTX 4050.\nAlso, I have a external RX7800. I might build a full PC in the future, but I also hooked it up via M2 just to get some extra FPS. The only thing I'm really concerned about, though, is how games will look when I'm not getting crazy 180Hz frame rates, since I won't hit 180fps+ every game.\n\nI’m also worried about whether it will be possible to watch movies at 24/30 fps on such a monitor. Or will they flicker?\nMy laptop has an IPS panel, and surprisingly, it’s decent, but I have no way to compare it to separate IPS monitors.\nI ordered an AOC Q27G4X (IPS) arriving, but I doubt I should keep it. I’m afraid of getting poor black color/levels. However, all the reviews I've watched for VA monitors mentioned they have very poor viewing angles, ghosting/smearing, slow response, and flicker... and yes, I'm not ready to buy an OLED...",

Well... as you can see, not great. Unfortunately, now that I know it's there I'm seeing it all the time in dark scenes. I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.",

A simple search via VESA's website does not display this model (or family). I also reached out to Innocn's support, and they admitted it had not been certified. At least they were honest? In the conversation, they stated it is currently not in process either. \n\nHow common is it for monitors to actually get certified after it has already been released? I have only ever seen it prior to release.\n\nHow much does this actually matter?\n\nIs the process to get certified expensive? I know some of their other models do have certifications. \n\nI know monitors can still hit the spec,  just have not been officially certified, but it does not appear to be the case here. According to this video from China, if I am reading this correctly it would be unable to adhere to the spec anyway.

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Ω) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Ω), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

After following some guides and videos, I managed to set everything up successfully.\n\nI then applied Oratory’s EQ profile for the Sennheiser HD560S ([link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vjyepkimg31sb2tjpprnl/Sennheiser-HD560S.pdf?rlkey=fei2h8kkt2qda6rc6f9qf69ti&e=2&dl=0)). The issue I’m facing now is that while the volume in Windows (YouTube/Spotify) sounds fine, the in-game audio becomes very quiet when using this EQ profile, even at max volume.\n\nOratory suggests increasing amplifier gain, but I don’t currently have an amp, just my motherboard driving the 560S. After checking some Reddit threads, I made a shortlist of potential DAC/amp options, but I’m unsure which one would best solve the issue and remain future-proof (in case I switch to something like IEMs or Beyerdynamics later).\n\nHere are the options I’m considering (considering I am EU based):\n\n* FiiO K11\n* FiiO K5 Pro\n* Topping DX3 Pro+\n* FX-Audio DAC-X6 Mini HiFi 2.0\n* Fosi Audio Q4\n* Any other alternative that I might have missed and is better than the above ones\n\nP.S. don't go too hard on me, I am all new to EQ and DACs/AMPs.",

It's a tool to create personalized EQ settings for your headphone on your head, and it's focused on convenience and usability.\n\nWe have now created a how-to video that shows how we (the creators) use the tool. The approach shown in the video is only one of multiple possible ways and there's more information in the Q&A section.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo)\n\nNote: You will need an EQ app like EqualizerAPO / Peace or EqMac to comfortably listen to music and other things on your system -- the Owliophile tool is only there to help you find the right settings.\n\nWe're planning to make more videos on the technical / theoretical background, as well as explaining all details of the tool, so if you're curious you are welcome to subscribe to the channel. Anyway, I hope this first one serves as a good and practical introduction to the topic of personalized equalization for some of you.\n\nCheers!  \nOwlio",

    "title": "Audeze LCD 2C - One Month Review",
    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

The measurements are basically on par with a simple pad swap onto the ADX3000. \n\nAnyway I am absolutely itching to buy new headphones, something fun, clear, open, with a nice treble pop to replace my Beyer DT1990's I've had since the release.  I was also one that got sucked into the HD800S hype - despite it being basically perfect i find them boring at times to where they sit in my drawer for over a year now without touching them.\n\n\n\n  \n",

Now, just disregard audio quality completely. I'm just talking noise cancelling with ANC. How is it that airpod pro 3s beat the xm5 in noise cancellation with ANC on? I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed. Sometimes the staff outright ignored me, completely unbothered, clicking away on his phone/laptop when the room is completely silent and just the two of us, when I made a comment or asked a question. \n\nI've gotten responses like \"Huh? Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

    "title": "Lets talk about the new Edition XV",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let’s talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I’ve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me — like being wrapped in honey. You’ll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It’s thick, elastic, and feels like it’s hugging the sides of your ears. It’s not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It’s the wet, creamy kind — like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro’s bass FEELS more aggressive. It’s like a scholar delivering an insult — refined, yet every word cuts deep. There’s more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there — it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I’m just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that’s not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY  different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That’s not necessarily good or bad — it’s all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they’re more refined but also smoother — which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro’s vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason — it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks — songs like city pop — take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I’d describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you’re tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That’s what the Edition XV feels like. It won’t shock you, it won’t thrill you — it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft — no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it’s the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage — the Edition XV’s lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro’s stage is even smaller, but it doesn’t have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it’s the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it’s Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth’s do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it’s a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it’s very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn’t too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren’t for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can’t wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I’ll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it’s a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

My set is: \n\n• Grado RS2x \n• HiFiman Subdara (2020)\n• Schiit Vali 2++\n• Schiit Modi\n\nI’ve had the Grados for a couple of years now and every time I use them it reminds me why i got into this “hobby” in the first place. Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x’s is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock—pretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can’t imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They’re far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have “arrived” with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren’t well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it’s just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they’ve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I’d dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up’s as well I’d love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

    "selftext": "I've been using the cloud alpha s headphones for five years or more and have loved them, with them being the only thing in my gaming setup that I've never replaced. unfortunately the bracket on the right headphone popped off a few days ago due to the screws stripping and while I've seen a post about putting a drop of superglue in with the screw to get it to form around the screw and hold it in place, I've only found one screw and the ear muffs(?) are falling apart as well as some of the top band falling apart, leaving black rubbery pieces in my hair to find when I shower and they fall out, so after extended use of these i decided its time to upgrade and while I'm sad to see these go, I hope the community can help me find a good upgrade that has a close enough feel and maybe even better sound",

    "title": "Kefine Delci AE: When spectacularity becomes art",
    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn’t hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don’t want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I’ve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn’t stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65€**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn’t have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle… but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let’s look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn’t have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone’s auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn’t tangle, and doesn’t pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don’t know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn’t find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn’t fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone’s intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn’t the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn’t interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don’t feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don’t need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors’ tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don’t know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can’t believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let’s talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn’t be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos’ very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn’t the highest resolution experience I’ve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let’s go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it’s the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn’t the best for purists since listening wasn’t fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don’t want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I’ve tested. At least up to the **100€/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what’s the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn’t perfect. In fact, technically, it’s inferior to two other competitors in its price range I’ve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I’m not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn’t hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you’ve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

    "title": "Myer Audio SLIIVO SL224 Earphones Review",
    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe radius of the metal part of the sound guide is 6.25 mm. in the thick end part and 5.55 in the main part.\n\nThe outer inserts are made of natural mother-of-pearl placed under a layer of transparent plastic. Mother-of-pearl mysteriously shimmers in the light, and small defects only emphasize the natural origin of the material and are not noticeable in reality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uo0fwmj7ruxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4057aa4590b0ca2e33a8365e4e610daf0a21b1b8\n\nThe connector pad is flat, it is slightly recessed into the housing. The compensation hole is covered with a plastic grate fused into the housing.\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore – [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics – they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Ω and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Ω.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment – it’s almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones – [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound… I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with.

    "title": "In the market: DCA Noire XO or E3?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

I stopped using these headphones about a year ago. The ear cups I've changed multiple times in the past, that's not that much of an issue. The yellowing of the white plastic is also expected (these are from literally the first batch of Virtuosos when they were just released in 2019). BUT THE HEADBAND! The headband started peeling off not that long ago and then it started to quickly deteriorate after that. I stopped using the Virtuoso and started using my Raycons instead, then I got my Nothing Ear. They have been ok, but at the same time, the Virtuoso is there in a corner, forgotten and neglected, but it is an amazing headset and I'd really like to get back to using it.\n\n  \nThey still work! I haven't put them on for obvious reasons (they have of course gotten much worse after not being touched for a while in a humid environment), but they still work.  \nI do not need headphones. I don't even game anymore. But sometimes I just want to use them and I can't in their current state.\n\nI also want to note I'm neither an audiophile nor a consumerist, and that's why I wouldn't even consider replacing them instead of just fixing them up a little bit if they still work just fine.",

The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for €150 in Europe two years ago, have been around €110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to €71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the €300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review — Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I’ve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp — a brilliant device — but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful — the **N7**’s machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm — hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45°C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless → WiiM Mini → Mojo 2 → Aune N7 → Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan – “Aja”**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio – “Sunday at the Village Vanguard”**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don’t just hear LaFaro’s bass — you feel it resonate. Evans’ piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy – “We Like It Here”**: A perfect showcase for the N7’s Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich – Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes — the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic – “Dreamtime Physics”**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7’s black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2’s clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation — like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10–15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Ω balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** — compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine’s staying put — and that’s the best endorsement I can give.",

HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be £3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring. At that moment I realised that they are perfect for me.",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it’s tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For “heavier” music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that’s clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It’s an excellent headphone and if you don’t AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n·        FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n·        FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n·        FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n·        FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n·        FiiO KA11.\n\n·        FiiO JA11.\n\n·        MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n·        Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n·        Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n·        Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n·        Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**€13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 €/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of €30 than one of €100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but…\n\n…let's start with the **package content:**\n\n·        The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n·        User manual\n\n·        A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n·        A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n·        The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the €13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n·        A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n·        Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n·        Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n·        Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but… the highs got easily out of control…\n\n… I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is… somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child’s voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors’ behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies’ guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **€13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n ",

Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones’ headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden’s Run to the Hills. The app’s EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The “Hell Blocker” noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

It's a tool to create personalized EQ settings for your headphone on your head, and it's focused on convenience and usability.\n\nWe have now created a how-to video that shows how we (the creators) use the tool. The approach shown in the video is only one of multiple possible ways and there's more information in the Q&A section.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo)\n\nNote: You will need an EQ app like EqualizerAPO / Peace or EqMac to comfortably listen to music and other things on your system -- the Owliophile tool is only there to help you find the right settings.\n\nWe're planning to make more videos on the technical / theoretical background, as well as explaining all details of the tool, so if you're curious you are welcome to subscribe to the channel. Anyway, I hope this first one serves as a good and practical introduction to the topic of personalized equalization for some of you.\n\nCheers!  \nOwlio",

    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

    "selftext": "***TL;DR:*** *Yes, they're that good. For me they hit all the sweet spots with ideal compromises for the price/package. The best ANC/Wireless/BT headphone I have heard. I think they deserve the hype in their neutral / out-of-the-box EQ. They cherry pick lots of great qualities and bundle them into a class defining package. I am happy they hit the price point they do. They feel made with love and care for anyone that loves high quality sound. They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Ω) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Ω), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

    "selftext": "I've never in my entire life, having visited more than 10 different audio shops around Asia, South East Asia, NA and Oceania-- have I ever encountered a store that makes me feel as unwelcome and as bothersome to the staff as I have in Addicted to Audio. \n\nI was greeted at the door, that's great. But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed. Sometimes the staff outright ignored me, completely unbothered, clicking away on his phone/laptop when the room is completely silent and just the two of us, when I made a comment or asked a question. \n\nI've gotten responses like \"Huh? Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it’s the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it’s Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth’s do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it’s a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it’s very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn’t too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren’t for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can’t wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I’ll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it’s a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Have been using my speakers as my main listening mode lately but this past week or so I’ve been gravitating toward my desktop set up over my stereo for digital listening. My set is: \n\n• Grado RS2x \n• HiFiman Subdara (2020)\n• Schiit Vali 2++\n• Schiit Modi\n\nI’ve had the Grados for a couple of years now and every time I use them it reminds me why i got into this “hobby” in the first place. Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x’s is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock—pretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can’t imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They’re far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have “arrived” with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren’t well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it’s just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they’ve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I’d dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up’s as well I’d love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let’s talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I’ve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me — like being wrapped in honey. You’ll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It’s thick, elastic, and feels like it’s hugging the sides of your ears. It’s not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It’s the wet, creamy kind — like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro’s bass FEELS more aggressive. It’s like a scholar delivering an insult — refined, yet every word cuts deep. There’s more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there — it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I’m just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that’s not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY  different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That’s not necessarily good or bad — it’s all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they’re more refined but also smoother — which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro’s vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason — it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks — songs like city pop — take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I’d describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you’re tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That’s what the Edition XV feels like. It won’t shock you, it won’t thrill you — it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft — no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it’s the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage — the Edition XV’s lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro’s stage is even smaller, but it doesn’t have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

It's a tool to create personalized EQ settings for your headphone on your head, and it's focused on convenience and usability.\n\nWe have now created a how-to video that shows how we (the creators) use the tool. The approach shown in the video is only one of multiple possible ways and there's more information in the Q&A section.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo)\n\nNote: You will need an EQ app like EqualizerAPO / Peace or EqMac to comfortably listen to music and other things on your system -- the Owliophile tool is only there to help you find the right settings.\n\nWe're planning to make more videos on the technical / theoretical background, as well as explaining all details of the tool, so if you're curious you are welcome to subscribe to the channel. Anyway, I hope this first one serves as a good and practical introduction to the topic of personalized equalization for some of you.\n\nCheers!  \nOwlio",

    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

    "selftext": "***TL;DR:*** *Yes, they're that good. For me they hit all the sweet spots with ideal compromises for the price/package. The best ANC/Wireless/BT headphone I have heard. I think they deserve the hype in their neutral / out-of-the-box EQ. They cherry pick lots of great qualities and bundle them into a class defining package. I am happy they hit the price point they do. They feel made with love and care for anyone that loves high quality sound. They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Ω) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Ω), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

    "selftext": "I've never in my entire life, having visited more than 10 different audio shops around Asia, South East Asia, NA and Oceania-- have I ever encountered a store that makes me feel as unwelcome and as bothersome to the staff as I have in Addicted to Audio. \n\nI was greeted at the door, that's great. But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed. Sometimes the staff outright ignored me, completely unbothered, clicking away on his phone/laptop when the room is completely silent and just the two of us, when I made a comment or asked a question. \n\nI've gotten responses like \"Huh? Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

Ive done research on all the different brands and models of handhelds and I have decided to go with the Steam Deck OLED 1TB. A few months back I got really into gaming controllers and did research on different kinds before ultimately getting a SCUF brand, FLYDIGI brand, and a GameSir to see what I enjoyed most and after experimenting with these different premium controllers ive found out what I really like when it comes to them. Because of this I was wanting to mod my steam deck a little bit to make it a little more comfortable. i was going to order all of the things I wanted to mod it with as well as the deck all at the same time and wanted to make sure I was getting the right stuff as well as get some insight from people who have tried these different things. Here are a list of the things I was going to order:\n\neXtremeRate Face Clicky Kit for Steam Deck OLED\n\nPlayVital Back Button Enhancement Set\n\nGuliKit Hall Effect Joystick Module\n\nDBRAND project killswitch case \n\nIve read some bad things about the GuliKit joysticks and I really want the ElecGear TMR sticks but I dont know how to solder nor do I really want to fool with learning how. What is your opinion on them if you have them?",

I force powered off by holding the power button and then turned it back on and it gave me the option to use the previous version but the same thing happened.

I found an old Reddit post that said to make a new folder titled downloads in the home part of dolphin file manager, and it got rid of the red text but my downloads from Firefox still don’t show up anywhere in dolphin. I’m worried I broke this machine forever any help at all would be sooooo so appreciated",

It works (WTF).\n\nEverything works fine for a week or 2, and then last night while using it in desktop mode with a vpn active the internet connection just went out.\n\nSo now I can connect to the wifi itself just fine, but the connection to the internet wont establish. Keep in mind my phone hotspot and dorm ethernet work just fine, just the dorm wifi network issue remains.\n\nI'm going to reach out to the IT team for the uni and see if it's an issue on their end, but I thought I'd ask here and see if someone has had a similar issue.\n\n  \nP.S: why are wifi issues still a thing for the oled at all?\n\n",

Whats wrong with it? \n\nTook good care of it, never dropped it, didn't game while charging, this never happened before, always connected.\n\nTried developer mode, dekstop mode (same same, makes me think is more a linux problem then a steam deck problem?) tried forgeting the networks, tried multiple networks, wifi works fine on other devices and worked well on steam deck before today as well.

    "selftext": "Steam Deck LCD 64GB / Official Valve Dock / Samsung LS29E790\n\nI've scoured multiple Reddit threads & articles, am currently over a week into troubleshooting, and am getting the sense that the docked experience is unreliable for any setup that isn't HDMI to a 16:9/1080 screen.\n\nAny time I've tried docking to an Ultrawide, or docking via DisplayPort, or worse, doing both at the same time, it's a nightmare. I've tried/toggled/experimented with all of the below settings & approaches:\n\n* Automatically Scale User Interface\n* External Display Safe Mode (from both the \"Display\" and \"Developer\" menus - **plus**, this one keeps toggling itself off)\n* Enable HDMI CEC Support\n* Maximum Game Resolution (Default, highest, exact to my monitor, etc.)\n* Reboot via \\[Quick Access\\] + \\[Vol -\\] + \\[Power\\] to reset the graphics APU/driver\n* Restarting the Deck with the Dock unplugged, then plugging it in before it powers back up (also Restarting with the Dock plugged in)\n* Unplugging/replugging/testing all display & power connections at various points in the docking cycle\n\nIt inexplicably works about 30% of the time, and rarely twice in a row despite not changing any settings between consecutive boots.\n\nWhen I run into HDMI trouble, the Deck's screen stays on and no feed gets to the monitor. But when I run into DisplayPort trouble, both the Deck's screen **and** my monitor go black, forcing me to use Steam Link on my phone to navigate to additional Display settings that only appear when Docked.\n\nI'm hoping that the biggest hurdle is simply my stupidity or blindness and that someone can point me in a very obvious direction to the solution, but I'm thinking that the sheer variety of monitor models is to blame for the difficulty in getting a reliable docked experience (especially on Ultrawide).\n\nHelp me, r/SteamDeck, you're my only hope.",

For the context, I dock the steam deck to another TV so i set Chiaki-ng resolution to 1080p for both external and internal. I set stream  quality at 1080p 60fps hdr at 50Mpbs. Normally the text is either messy with FSR or blurry with liner. Which I don’t understand because it should be supersampling from 1080p to 720p with better quality.\n\nAnyways, as you can see, with lossless scaling on, the text is quite clean, it feels almost like 1080p.

I play rarely ps5 (most time for exclusive titels, like Yotei) and super rarely online on ps5 so I need ps+ only for Arc Raiders.

Recently, I decided to completely reinstall/remod my New Vegas using Viva New Vegas as a base. I had a bit of difficulty getting MO2 reinstalled, but all I had to do was update Protontricks and wine and I had it running. \n\nBut today is very different. Firstly, somehow, my FalloutNV.exe file just disappeared from my install folder? And after verifying the integrity of the game files, MO2 no longer loaded up. No big deal, we'll just reinstall it. \n\nNow, MO2 fails at the very end, when it's configuring the game prefix. This is the same problem I had previously before updating Wine/Protontricks, but this time they're both up to date (as far as I know)? I've tried redownloading the MO2 Linux installer multiple times, tried completely uninstalling/reinstalling my New Vegas multiple times, and tried restarting my Steam Deck. I have no idea what the issue is and I'm very frustrated.\n\nCould it be that I saved a few folders from my previous (working) MO2 folder? I saved the plugins, mods, and profiles folder because I didn't want to restart from scratch with over 300 mods.",

I did some research and found out that people were having it repaired under warranty, I bought my Steamdeck several years ago and wasn't sure that I even had a warranty left. I decided that I would repair it myself since it might be faster than trying to send it back to Valve. I bought a replacement battery and spent some stressful minutes trying to remove the dead battery. After removing it I gently installed my new battery and brought my deck to the charger and was relived to see %1 battery life. I am not used to repairing expensive electronics myself and am so happy that I am holding a charge again. The picture below is the kit that I used for anyone needing to do this repair in the future. Happy gaming.",

Otherwise it controls perfectly once you get past that initial screen. \n\nI think if Capcom cared enough there would be a little warning before the game started reminding you to tap the start screen and the rest of the game would work perfectly. I don’t see how this is unsupported on the deck. I had a great time. No fussing with Proton settings. Just out of the box worked great for the entire 12hrs I put into it. \n\nAnyways onto RE:6. ",

Normally the text is either messy with FSR or blurry with liner. Which I don’t understand because it should be supersampling from 1080p to 720p with better quality.\n\nAnyways, as you can see, with lossless scaling on, the text is quite clean, it feels almost like 1080p.

Seeing as this game is a few years old now, I figured it would work better than it is on an initial download without any tinkering.\n\nYes I could play it on my pc but I dont tend to enjoy story games as much sitting at the desk vs chillin on the couch with the deck.\n\n\nTIA",

Ive done research on all the different brands and models of handhelds and I have decided to go with the Steam Deck OLED 1TB. A few months back I got really into gaming controllers and did research on different kinds before ultimately getting a SCUF brand, FLYDIGI brand, and a GameSir to see what I enjoyed most and after experimenting with these different premium controllers ive found out what I really like when it comes to them. Because of this I was wanting to mod my steam deck a little bit to make it a little more comfortable. i was going to order all of the things I wanted to mod it with as well as the deck all at the same time and wanted to make sure I was getting the right stuff as well as get some insight from people who have tried these different things. Here are a list of the things I was going to order:\n\neXtremeRate Face Clicky Kit for Steam Deck OLED\n\nPlayVital Back Button Enhancement Set\n\nGuliKit Hall Effect Joystick Module\n\nDBRAND project killswitch case \n\nIve read some bad things about the GuliKit joysticks and I really want the ElecGear TMR sticks but I dont know how to solder nor do I really want to fool with learning how. What is your opinion on them if you have them?",

I did some research and found out that people were having it repaired under warranty, I bought my Steamdeck several years ago and wasn't sure that I even had a warranty left. I decided that I would repair it myself since it might be faster than trying to send it back to Valve. I bought a replacement battery and spent some stressful minutes trying to remove the dead battery. After removing it I gently installed my new battery and brought my deck to the charger and was relived to see %1 battery life. I am not used to repairing expensive electronics myself and am so happy that I am holding a charge again. The picture below is the kit that I used for anyone needing to do this repair in the future.

I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated.

    "title": "New lighting setup questions",
    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

I like to sleep cold, but enjoy getting up with a moderately warm room. \n\nI already have a fan that turns off about 30 minutes to an hour before I wake up, which is nice. The thing I'm looking for is a way for my door to be closed as well. (I don't have a window, the door leads to a small balcony). I noticed there are a number of products that allow for automation when it comes to allowing pets through or manual opening and closing, but none that include a timer. Am I just being blind and missing them or do they not exist? \n\nIf anyone has a solution, I would love to hear it! (Sleeping in a warm room is not an option)",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, we are working on something and I'd like to know your honest opinion, sort of a sense-check.\n\nIt's a tool (or rather a suite of tools) that guides you step by step through the process of building and maintaining a smart home. A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

Basically if we have negative air pressure in the room I risk burning up my oven control units very quickly. As you can imagine this is expensive both to repair and both in time. Air pressure can be controlled with the facilitation of a make up air system and multiple exhaust fans that can be individually switched on and off. \n\nIdeally I’d have sensor that goes off and sounds an audible alarm if say there is too much negative air pressure so that the bakers can adjust things.\n\nDoes something like this exist ready to go out of the box?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

(and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated.

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

    "selftext": "Hello! I have been doing some research on a system that will open and close my sliding glass door on a timer. I like to sleep cold, but enjoy getting up with a moderately warm room. \n\nI already have a fan that turns off about 30 minutes to an hour before I wake up, which is nice. The thing I'm looking for is a way for my door to be closed as well. (I don't have a window, the door leads to a small balcony). I noticed there are a number of products that allow for automation when it comes to allowing pets through or manual opening and closing, but none that include a timer. Am I just being blind and missing them or do they not exist? \n\nIf anyone has a solution, I would love to hear it! (Sleeping in a warm room is not an option)",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, we are working on something and I'd like to know your honest opinion, sort of a sense-check.\n\nIt's a tool (or rather a suite of tools) that guides you step by step through the process of building and maintaining a smart home. A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated.

    "title": "New lighting setup questions",
    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4).

Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

I have some that are in inconvenient spots that it would be nice to have. I would prefer something I can integrate with google home or another app (sorry to the google haters, that’s just what I have rn). I know there are options with remotes but those would disappear very quickly.\n\nAs I’m shopping around, I can’t seem to find many that don’t come with the switch plate. I don’t necessarily need to change the actual switches, just the capabilities. I am not against changing the plates, but the only ones I can find are for a single switch. All of mine have two separate switches, one for the light and one for the fan.\n\nAny ideas on where I could get a switch and receiver kit that would work for me?",

The next requirement is that they have programmable sensitivity and trigger time. \n\nThanks!\n\n————-\n\n\nI’m tired of batteries. I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I’m ready to just go wired where I can. It’s inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it’s hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is … no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).

The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit?

The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

You can get the Vivint smarthome hardware and install with or without the code.",

Thank you all so much, I really appreciate this community so much. \n\n\n\nHi all, thank you in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\n**Prior to our issues:** we have a Google Home and multiple brands/types of smart devices. All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

I noticed that when I plug in the one that is still working, the button briefly lights up red. Nothing happens with the \"broken\" one. I think it is the ET2 model, but there are pictures. Is it really broken, or am I being stupid?\n\n",

It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Right now, I have to turn it by hand every time, but I’d love to find a way to automate this process.\n\nIdeally, I need something easy to set up that can make the knob turn one notch to the right, or one (at most two) to the left, to bring it back to zero. I don’t need full remote control, just a simple solution that can handle this small motion—so I can avoid having to do it manually each time.\n\nHas anybody tried something similar or have any tips or suggestions for a device or hack I could use?

The single Maestro switch has that feature. \n\nI have Lutron Caseta switches + hub elsewhere in the house, so bonus if it all works together. OTOH, I don't think I need to control these lights from an app. \n\nI saw there is a Lutron motion sensor (PD-OSENS-WH) that pairs with a Caseta kind of like a Pico remote. I was thinking of mounting that in the corner of the L, but I think that violates #3 since it has no knowledge of the light was manually operated from the Caseta.\n\nCan someone suggest some options?

I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I’m ready to just go wired where I can. It’s inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it’s hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is … no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there.

I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

    "selftext": "3200sqft home, 2 story and single zone. Bedroom is on upper floor, living area is downstairs. Thermostat is on the bottom floor. No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

It’s controlled by both a remote and an app. The remote stays on the nightstand, so it’s not being pressed accidentally, and the app isn’t set on any kind of schedule.\n\nAt night, though, the fan will randomly shut off and the light turns on.\n\nMy guess is that the light-on state is the default, and maybe a brief power interruption or short in the circuit is causing the fan to lose power and restart in its default mode — fan off, light on. \n\nIt’s brand new though. Can anyone suggest a solution? I reached out to the manufacturer and they are shipping a replacement circuit board. Hopefully that fixes it, but could there be a problem with the circuit? I wouldn’t want to cause a fire. \n",

I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

Is there a way to increase the reliability of this automation?  I have plenty of windows, a cat and its a big open area.

Any suggestions (or even setup tips) would be massively appreciated!",

I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I’m ready to just go wired where I can. It’s inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it’s hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is … no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

    "title": "Smart home Setup - internet issues",
    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "title": "Dark Apartment - need ideas / solutions",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

I tried some things like setting the resolution in steam launch options and forcing fullscreen but that doesn't seem to work as when I hover over the process it shows in the top left of the screen in a small window.\n\nI've tried to search around on google for a solution but haven't really been able to find anything relating to this specific issue no matter how I phrase the search and just kinda accepted it and didn't play the game. \n\nI've however recently bought Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on steam and was hoping to play it since I remember playing it when I was younger but I've run into the same issue now so I thought it may be worth a shot to ask in here if anyone knows what could be causing this and or how to fix it",

The codes are one time use only so I had to go to the lobby and get a new one. Now today same thing happened to my wifes phone again. Meanwhile I am still connected with no problems whatsoever. We are both using iPhones so I think this has to be some sort of setting. I just dont feel like explaining myself every other day at the reception, so I would like a fix for this. Any ideas what might be causing this?",

    "selftext": "To preface this, I left my apartment for around a week. When I left, my PC was working with no issues. I come back, and when I turned on my PC all the hardware came on, then immediately turned off. On my MOBO it went from the DRAM light to the CPU light, and immediately turned off.\n\nI originally thought this was a PSU problem, and bought a new power supply (Corsair CX750M -> RM850x) Of course, no dice.\n\nI then checked my ram, and swapped it with a spare stick I had. Still the same problem. Then I thought it had to be the motherboard then, and I swapped my MOBO for the same model (Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX). Again, same problem.\n\nMy last ditch thought was that it could be a CPU problem, and I swapped my CPU for a new Ryzen 7 7800x3d. Once again, did not fix the problem.\n\nAt this point, I was just completely lost. I tried unplugging all my case’s headers, like the front panel, audio, and USB connectors. I then started the PC by shorting the power on pins with a screwdriver. The PC actually stayed on this time, but did not boot.\n\nA couple things I also tried was booting without the GPU. After this, I tried plugging the PC into different outlets to make sure it wasn’t just an outlet problem. Both of course did not work.\n\nThe MOBO light sequence started at DRAM, stayed there for around 20 seconds, went to VGA which instantly cleared, then went back to CPU where it stayed on with no boot or display. \n\nMy last ditch effort was thinking there was some sort of short here, and bought a NZXT internal USB hub. I kept this the only thing connected to MOBO usb wise, with again no case connectors. I plugged my AIO USB into here. Originally when I gave it SATA power, the radiator fans and GPU LEDS stayed permanently on, and when it went from VGA to CPU the PC would shut off and then not start again until I unplugged the PSU. \n\nThis led me to try once with it connected to the hub but giving it no SATA power once to the same result as before with it staying on the CPU light and not booting, but also not shutting off. I did that once then just plugged the AIO back into one of the mobos USB connectors to the same result.\n\nI tried multiple times reapplying the AIO pump to make sure it was getting even pressure and wasn’t overtightened. All of this has not worked, and now here I am.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas or knows what’s going on it would be well appreciated.\n\nMy build:\nNZXT H5 Flow\nGigabyte B650 Eagle AX (swapped for same board) \nRTX 2080 \nRyzen 7 7700x -> Ryzen 7 7800x3d (swapped)\nNZXT Kraken 360 \nCorsair CX750M -> Corsair RM850x\n32gb Crucial DDR5 5600MHz x2 16 sticks\nSamsung 990 Pro",

    "selftext": "So, quick context: I've had to replace one of my fans before, the CPU one to be exact.  It's been a long while since then and I'm currently saving up for an upgrade.  However, until then, my laptop's all I have atm.  It started running fairly hot so I opened it up to check the fans and blast it with pressurized air.  Other than some hairballs, the CPU is running...ok.  Not the best (5555 RPM) but the GPU fan's completely dead.  It took effort to spin it with my finger which is the same problem with the CPU fan.  While I'm here, might as well replace the CPU fan too.  So I went looking, found replacements aplenty of CPU fans for my model of laptop, but I keep finding GPU fans lumps together only for the seller details to either lie through their title that they have the part or they don't specify how you're to differentiate between the CPU or GPU fan at checkout.  I've also gotten conflicting information about whether the fans are interchangeable or not since according to sellers, they are.  However, asking this question and Google's AI says they're not.  Not gonna trust something like this in a system that has gotten things wrong before, so I ask the hardware nerds of Reddit: Are the CPU and GPU cooling fans for the PH315-51 Acer Predator Helios 300 interchangeable?",

    "title": "Bluetooth Earphones with no sound",
    "selftext": "Have a set of Anker Soundcore Aerofit 2, they are relatively new but recently stopped functioning correctly, although I can't pinpoint any changes I made to prompt it. Basically, when it is connected to my computer as \"Headphones Stereo,\" there is no sound coming from them. Under sound settings, they are set to \"default\" and the green soundbar thing moves as if sound is supposed to be emitting from it. However, if I switch them to \"Headset,\" then I do get sound however poorer quality. I am able to pair different bluetooth earphones and do not encounter this problem. I am also able to pair the Aerofit 2 earphones to my iphone and get sound without issues. I have already tried to unpair and pair them. I have manually reset the earphones. I updated the bluetooth drivers on my PC. I have also tried to disable the Headset (Hands-Free AG Audio) version under sound settings. Let me know if you guys can think of any other suggestions, thanks",

    "selftext": "Let me preface by saying that I rarely use Reddit, so please be nice lol.\n\nI have a PC that I built in late 2020 that has been giving me a weird issue for a while now.\n\nSpecs are  \nAMD 5900x  \nEVGA 3080 FTW3 (10GB)  \nSN850  \n4x8 G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4-3600 CL16-16-16-36 Samsung B Die.\n\nThe issue is Freezing at idle or doing simple tasks such as web browsing.  When the PC has a Youtube video playing, or while I'm gaming, Its runs perfect.  However it will often hard freeze once there's no videos or games playing. Only way back is to hold power button down to hard power cycle the pc\n\nI have\n\nVerified that all drivers/firmware are up to date.  \nTried every windows power plan (on balanced now as it is recommended for 5900x scheduling etc)  \nReseated my GPU  \nTried taking out ram and reseating  \nTried running dual channel A1/B1 and A2/B2 instead of occupying all 4 dimm slots.  \nTried BOTH XMP profiles  \nThoroughly Cleaned the PC (other than minor dust accumulation, everything was clean)  \nChecked all connections to MOBO and all Hardware  \nRan Benchmarks with HWMonitor open and temps/voltages all look great (Benchmarks always result with the PC running in the top 98th percentile or higher for my hardware)  \nNever overclocked anything. Closest thing would be enabling XMP profiles.\n\nThe issue went away for a few months over the summer but has since returned.  Event viewer shows nothing other than improper shutdown with no other details when the freezes happen.  Task manager never shows any crazy usage etc.\n\nI am beyond stumped and really just want to chuck this PC into a fire at this point.\n\nAny any all help is greatly appreciated!",

Today I noticed that my Acer XF270HU now has light greyish horizontal lines across the monitor at all times, even on the No Signal screen. It's most noticeable with light colors and greys.\n\nI noticed that at 144 hz, the scanlines are always present, but at 60 hz the monitor looks normal except for a flicker where the scanlines return and the screen goes slightly darker, then returns to normal. This flicker happens every 2 seconds or so.\n\nI power cycled the monitor, tried messing with colors/turn off Overdrive/factory reset settings. I also used the input cables (hdmi and dp) on a different monitor and that monitor doesn't have the issue. I plugged in a different laptop to the XF270HU and it still happens. \n\nIs the laptop dead? I've had it since 2019 so if it is at least it had a good life. TIA!",

The ProfileImagePath in the registry is correctly pointing to C:\\\\Users\\\\Simplon.\n2. The other Administrators on the system do not have this issue; they can access their profiles without a problem.\n3. I have checked the Registry and found no anomalies related to my profile.\n4.

Thinking the issue is likely software related, but looking for some tips on where to start past the most basic stuff. I’ve already tried multiple cords, making sure everything is seated/plugged in properly. Also I know the GPU has power, as it’s still lighting up and fans are spinning. Also worth noting, the main monitor is constantly turning itself on and off, so it’s like it’s realizing that something is trying to display through it, but it’s just not working.

    "selftext": "Last may my girlfriend got a cyberpower prebuilt for her birthday, and other than a few slight issues with performance there has never been something quite like what is happening now.\n\nAfter one of the more recent windows 11 updates, certain things like the overwatch voice chat system and store will not load when they would normally, another instance being on phasmophobia she cannot connect to the multiplayer system at ALL.\n\nWe have tried things like resetting her windows installation which that process didn't start properly with her pc. The newer update versions that claim to be \"fixed\" are not helping either. She uses a tplink powerline adapter but we do not think it has anything to do with her internet because this only started happening after the update, which unfortunately she's unable to revert.\n\nA while ago when she started launching overwatch it would come up with a pop up saying she needs to update her bios to be compatible with her CPU, it would launch anyways and run fine after closing that pop up though. Could this be it?",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I made a reddit account just for this post because something a month ago occurred to me but now im wondering if it meant anything.  On Septermber 7, 2025, my pc (which ive had for about 3 years now) started acting up and becoming super slow. I decided to shut down my pc and restart it hoping maybe that would fix it, (since my pc is on the older side and it acts up sometimes). I then assumed that this mightve been malware, so I ran my files through the built in windows malware detector to see if anything was suspicious, but nothing came up. I decided to shut down my pc again because my pc was still acting slow, and the process of opening anything at all was super laggy. However, on my second attempt, something extremely weird came up. All of sudden, my apps all went missing, and my wallpaper was completely black. A weird message on the bottom of my pc read “Something is watching you” this occured at 2:43PM, and to be honest, i wasnt too scared because i assumed it to be just malware, or maybe this is farfetched, but i do use wallpaper engine, and maybe the person who made my wallpaper put some sort of code or whatever that could do that when i start up my pc, i dont know much to be honest. I took a screenshot and i also told my family, but after a minute or so my pc went completely back to normal and everything went back to being smooth. I threw away my webcam after that. As of now, my pc is still normal and i have never gotten that pop up again; there has also been no sign of malware. I also tried searching this up online but nothing similar came up. If you guys know anything about this please let me know! Im just a little curious but i hope this doesnt lead to anything harmful.\n\nId like to mention that my pc also does this thing where it turns on and off by it self in the middle of the night when i set it to sleep. I just assumed that it was because my mouse was super sensitive and the \"wind was setting it off\" but im not sure anymore..\n\nIf you guys would like to see a screenshot i also posted this to r/pchelphub\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PCHelpHub/s/qeHaKjoV1H",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I hope this is the right place to ask.\n\nI recently bought an old crt (philips 14pv110-01) and I'm trying to set it up. The problem is that I don't have the controller and I can't get past the language selection screen because I have to press the OK button (there's no ok button on the TV itself). I bought an universal controller but the OK button didn't work. I could change the language, but not press ok to confirm it.\n\nI returned the controller and tried a regular philips one but it didn't work either, I think it's too new. My Wii U's remote control mode did work but had the same issues as the first one and for some reason it turned the tv on by pressing 1?\n\nI'm wondering: is this an infrared sensor issue or a controller issue? If anyone has any ideas please share them, I'm a bit desperate here. I just wanna play super mario retro style.",

Thought it would be a simple fix, so used Acronis to clone the 2TB over the SSD.  Now I can't boot from either.  Guessing I've overwritten the boot partition that lived on the SSD that pointed to the Windows install on the 2TB drive.\n\nEither way, what is the method to fix so I can boot off of the SSD.  Windows 11, and if possible I'd rather not do a reinstall if I can avoid it.\n\nI've since pulled the SSD, and installed a new one, and installed Windows 11 on it.  I then created a recovery USB disk with that install, but haven't put the old SSD back in and tried any of the recovery options yet.  I'm hoping to get a few pointers before I get to it later today.\n\nThank you in advance!",

But advice from HP (I’m using an Elitebook) was to observe if such blurry/flickering occurs in the BIOS settings. There isn’t the flickering which means it is not a hardware issue.\n\nToday, I found out that when I open my file explorer or settings while my screen is being blurry on Youtube, the blurryness of the screen stopped. The blurring continued when the tab is reopened.\n\nPossible stuff I was thinking: I’ve just updated my Intel graphics driver recently as Riot Games can’t initialise graphics devices. It’s the 32.0.101.7076 for the Iris Xe Graphics Driver. Downloaded random older Intel drivers for 11th gen Intel Graphics Driver off the Intel website during the process of fixing the Riot Games issue.  Probably adjusted some settings and clean installs which I’m not entirely sure.\n\nThanks!",

I would insert the number on the top right, then add my name beside it and there was no gap.\n\nNow, I have to click it, where the only options that show are a \"Add Page Number,\" \"Format Page Number,\" and \"Remove Page Numbers.\" It brings up a little window where I can select an alignment, but when I do that it puts the number in a draggable box and makes a big gap between my name and the number. I can't figure out a way to make it show me a picture of the alignment like it did before, or how to stop the number from going into a draggable box. \n\nI managed to make it look sort of right by selecting the Ion (Light) setting on Headers, but now there's a larger space between the start of what I was writing and the header.

I decided to shut down my pc again because my pc was still acting slow, and the process of opening anything at all was super laggy. However, on my second attempt, something extremely weird came up. All of sudden, my apps all went missing, and my wallpaper was completely black. A weird message on the bottom of my pc read “Something is watching you” this occured at 2:43PM, and to be honest, i wasnt too scared because i assumed it to be just malware, or maybe this is farfetched, but i do use wallpaper engine, and maybe the person who made my wallpaper put some sort of code or whatever that could do that when i start up my pc, i dont know much to be honest. I took a screenshot and i also told my family, but after a minute or so my pc went completely back to normal and everything went back to being smooth. I threw away my webcam after that. As of now, my pc is still normal and i have never gotten that pop up again; there has also been no sign of malware. I also tried searching this up online but nothing similar came up. If you guys know anything about this please let me know! Im just a little curious but i hope this doesnt lead to anything harmful.\n\nId like to mention that my pc also does this thing where it turns on and off by it self in the middle of the night when i set it to sleep. I just assumed that it was because my mouse was super sensitive and the \"wind was setting it off\" but im not sure anymore..\n\nIf you guys would like to see a screenshot i also posted this to r/pchelphub\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PCHelpHub/s/qeHaKjoV1H",

    "title": "My PC stopped powering on overnight, no signs of life",
    "selftext": "**Context:**\n\nOver the last few weeks, I noticed it was taking considerably longer for the POST screen to show up when booting up my PC. Going by the sound of the fans, I felt like it had to \"restart\" once or twice before going through. When reaching desktop, the time would be set wrong each time as well (only the time though, not the date). Along the way I figured out my BIOS was getting reset on (probably) each boot. As a random idea I tried updating my BIOS to version F20, which didn't seem to do anything.\n\nSo yesterday, I committed and took everything apart to replace the CMOS battery. I'm really regretting this mini-ITX shit right now. Anyway, new battery, threw my rig back together, everything seemed okay and things ran just fine for the next 8 hours or so. Didn't notice anything strange when shutting down.\n\nToday, I come home from work, I fire up my PC, and nothing. No lights, no fans, no sounds. It's just dead. I can even feel it in how the power button clicks that there's nothing going on in there.\n\nWhen trying to diagnose the problem, the only observation I was able to make, is that the PSU makes a very quiet, continuous, rapid clicking sound when turned on, yet only when it's connected to the 24-pin. Strangely, the sound also persists after switching the power back off, until I disconnect the actual power cable. No idea what that means.\n\n**What I've tried:**\n\n* Using a different power cable: *No change*\n* Using a different outlet: *No change*\n* Reconnecting the power button to the motherboard: *No change*\n* Shorting the PWR+ and PWR- pins with a screwdriver: *Suspicious of my accuracy but no change*\n* Paperclip test: *PSU fan spins for a (literal) second, then stops. Likely the zero-RPM feature*\n* Shorting the CLR\\_CMOS pins with a screwdriver: *No change*\n* Discharging the capacitors: *No change*\n\nDid I brick the install of the new CMOS battery somehow? I used a Stanley knife to pry the spot-welded connectors off the old battery. One came off almost perfectly, the other end got nicked in places but was still in one piece. It's held together with electrical tape.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Gigabyte AORUS B550i PRO AX rev1.0\n* Corsair SF600 Platinum\n* AMD Ryzen 5 5600X\n* Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GAMING OC 8G\n* G.Skill 32GB DDR4-3600\n* ADATA SX8200 Pro, 2TB SSD\n\n**What I'm thinking of trying:**\n\nI'm gonna head out and get a multimeter tomorrow, see if the PSU is actually delivering the correct power. If the PSU is fine, I'll tear the whole thing apart again to check the CMOS battery. I have no idea how to diagnose the motherboard, though. Do I need to get an ammeter or something? I could also try reseating everything, I guess?\n\nAny insight is more than appreciated, I am quite frankly at my wit's end here.",

When the PC has a Youtube video playing, or while I'm gaming, Its runs perfect.  However it will often hard freeze once there's no videos or games playing. Only way back is to hold power button down to hard power cycle the pc\n\nI have\n\nVerified that all drivers/firmware are up to date.  \nTried every windows power plan (on balanced now as it is recommended for 5900x scheduling etc)  \nReseated my GPU  \nTried taking out ram and reseating  \nTried running dual channel A1/B1 and A2/B2 instead of occupying all 4 dimm slots.  \nTried BOTH XMP profiles  \nThoroughly Cleaned the PC (other than minor dust accumulation, everything was clean)  \nChecked all connections to MOBO and all Hardware  \nRan Benchmarks with HWMonitor open and temps/voltages all look great (Benchmarks always result with the PC running in the top 98th percentile or higher for my hardware)  \nNever overclocked anything. Closest thing would be enabling XMP profiles.\n\nThe issue went away for a few months over the summer but has since returned.  Event viewer shows nothing other than improper shutdown with no other details when the freezes happen.  Task manager never shows any crazy usage etc.\n\nI am beyond stumped and really just want to chuck this PC into a fire at this point.\n\nAny any all help is greatly appreciated!",

I tried some things like setting the resolution in steam launch options and forcing fullscreen but that doesn't seem to work as when I hover over the process it shows in the top left of the screen in a small window.\n\nI've tried to search around on google for a solution but haven't really been able to find anything relating to this specific issue no matter how I phrase the search and just kinda accepted it and didn't play the game. \n\nI've however recently bought Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on steam and was hoping to play it since I remember playing it when I was younger but I've run into the same issue now so I thought it may be worth a shot to ask in here if anyone knows what could be causing this and or how to fix it",

    "selftext": "To preface this, I left my apartment for around a week. When I left, my PC was working with no issues. I come back, and when I turned on my PC all the hardware came on, then immediately turned off. On my MOBO it went from the DRAM light to the CPU light, and immediately turned off.\n\nI originally thought this was a PSU problem, and bought a new power supply (Corsair CX750M -> RM850x) Of course, no dice.\n\nI then checked my ram, and swapped it with a spare stick I had. Still the same problem. Then I thought it had to be the motherboard then, and I swapped my MOBO for the same model (Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX). Again, same problem.\n\nMy last ditch thought was that it could be a CPU problem, and I swapped my CPU for a new Ryzen 7 7800x3d. Once again, did not fix the problem.\n\nAt this point, I was just completely lost. I tried unplugging all my case’s headers, like the front panel, audio, and USB connectors. I then started the PC by shorting the power on pins with a screwdriver. The PC actually stayed on this time, but did not boot.\n\nA couple things I also tried was booting without the GPU. After this, I tried plugging the PC into different outlets to make sure it wasn’t just an outlet problem. Both of course did not work.\n\nThe MOBO light sequence started at DRAM, stayed there for around 20 seconds, went to VGA which instantly cleared, then went back to CPU where it stayed on with no boot or display. \n\nMy last ditch effort was thinking there was some sort of short here, and bought a NZXT internal USB hub. I kept this the only thing connected to MOBO usb wise, with again no case connectors. I plugged my AIO USB into here. Originally when I gave it SATA power, the radiator fans and GPU LEDS stayed permanently on, and when it went from VGA to CPU the PC would shut off and then not start again until I unplugged the PSU. \n\nThis led me to try once with it connected to the hub but giving it no SATA power once to the same result as before with it staying on the CPU light and not booting, but also not shutting off. I did that once then just plugged the AIO back into one of the mobos USB connectors to the same result.\n\nI tried multiple times reapplying the AIO pump to make sure it was getting even pressure and wasn’t overtightened. All of this has not worked, and now here I am.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas or knows what’s going on it would be well appreciated.\n\nMy build:\nNZXT H5 Flow\nGigabyte B650 Eagle AX (swapped for same board) \nRTX 2080 \nRyzen 7 7700x -> Ryzen 7 7800x3d (swapped)\nNZXT Kraken 360 \nCorsair CX750M -> Corsair RM850x\n32gb Crucial DDR5 5600MHz x2 16 sticks\nSamsung 990 Pro",

I believe part of this might be because of unnecessary programs, files, etc. downloaded on my PC.\n\nI have looked into simply uninstalling and deleting what I believe is doing whatever to my pc making it slow, but since everything’s well organised on my PC, a complete wipe of it would not be much of a hassle—it at least does not seem like it. It would also be easier for me to then start all over again and to then maybe do it right this time.\n\nMy question is whether I should factory reset, or clean install windows 11 again, and then if any of you people (hopefully) could either guide me or send any helpful guides my way. I am of course willing to provide whatever piece of information you might need. :)",

However, it shut down immediately after I lifted my smartphone off the top-left side of the touchpad. After that event, it didn’t turn on again.\n\nI asked my friend for help again and he said the problem might be related to the motherboard. He said it has to be replaced, but it is also expensive.

If the problem is the motherboard, I think I will have to buy a second-hand laptop.\n\nThank you for your help.",

    "selftext": "So, quick context: I've had to replace one of my fans before, the CPU one to be exact.  It's been a long while since then and I'm currently saving up for an upgrade.  However, until then, my laptop's all I have atm.  It started running fairly hot so I opened it up to check the fans and blast it with pressurized air.  Other than some hairballs, the CPU is running...ok.  Not the best (5555 RPM) but the GPU fan's completely dead.  It took effort to spin it with my finger which is the same problem with the CPU fan.  While I'm here, might as well replace the CPU fan too.  So I went looking, found replacements aplenty of CPU fans for my model of laptop, but I keep finding GPU fans lumps together only for the seller details to either lie through their title that they have the part or they don't specify how you're to differentiate between the CPU or GPU fan at checkout.  I've also gotten conflicting information about whether the fans are interchangeable or not since according to sellers, they are.  However, asking this question and Google's AI says they're not.  Not gonna trust something like this in a system that has gotten things wrong before, so I ask the hardware nerds of Reddit: Are the CPU and GPU cooling fans for the PH315-51 Acer Predator Helios 300 interchangeable?",

This flicker happens every 2 seconds or so.\n\nI power cycled the monitor, tried messing with colors/turn off Overdrive/factory reset settings. I also used the input cables (hdmi and dp) on a different monitor and that monitor doesn't have the issue. I plugged in a different laptop to the XF270HU and it still happens. \n\nIs the laptop dead?

Any ideas?\n\nHardware:\n\n* ASUS TUF RTX 5090\n* 9800X3D\n* 64GB RAM (forgot model)\n* 990 Pro 2TB SSD\n\n**System info:**\n\n* Edition: Windows 11 Pro\n* Version: 25H2\n* Installed on: 10/4/2025\n* OS build: 26200.6899\n* Experience: Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.26100.253.0",

The ProfileImagePath in the registry is correctly pointing to C:\\\\Users\\\\Simplon.\n2.

I would insert the number on the top right, then add my name beside it and there was no gap.\n\nNow, I have to click it, where the only options that show are a \"Add Page Number,\" \"Format Page Number,\" and \"Remove Page Numbers.\" It brings up a little window where I can select an alignment, but when I do that it puts the number in a draggable box and makes a big gap between my name and the number. I can't figure out a way to make it show me a picture of the alignment like it did before, or how to stop the number from going into a draggable box. \n\nI managed to make it look sort of right by selecting the Ion (Light) setting on Headers, but now there's a larger space between the start of what I was writing and the header.

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I made a reddit account just for this post because something a month ago occurred to me but now im wondering if it meant anything.  On Septermber 7, 2025, my pc (which ive had for about 3 years now) started acting up and becoming super slow. I decided to shut down my pc and restart it hoping maybe that would fix it, (since my pc is on the older side and it acts up sometimes). I then assumed that this mightve been malware, so I ran my files through the built in windows malware detector to see if anything was suspicious, but nothing came up. I decided to shut down my pc again because my pc was still acting slow, and the process of opening anything at all was super laggy. However, on my second attempt, something extremely weird came up. All of sudden, my apps all went missing, and my wallpaper was completely black. A weird message on the bottom of my pc read “Something is watching you” this occured at 2:43PM, and to be honest, i wasnt too scared because i assumed it to be just malware, or maybe this is farfetched, but i do use wallpaper engine, and maybe the person who made my wallpaper put some sort of code or whatever that could do that when i start up my pc, i dont know much to be honest. I took a screenshot and i also told my family, but after a minute or so my pc went completely back to normal and everything went back to being smooth. I threw away my webcam after that. As of now, my pc is still normal and i have never gotten that pop up again; there has also been no sign of malware. I also tried searching this up online but nothing similar came up. If you guys know anything about this please let me know! Im just a little curious but i hope this doesnt lead to anything harmful.\n\nId like to mention that my pc also does this thing where it turns on and off by it self in the middle of the night when i set it to sleep. I just assumed that it was because my mouse was super sensitive and the \"wind was setting it off\" but im not sure anymore..\n\nIf you guys would like to see a screenshot i also posted this to r/pchelphub\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PCHelpHub/s/qeHaKjoV1H",

    "title": "My PC stopped powering on overnight, no signs of life",
    "selftext": "**Context:**\n\nOver the last few weeks, I noticed it was taking considerably longer for the POST screen to show up when booting up my PC. Going by the sound of the fans, I felt like it had to \"restart\" once or twice before going through. When reaching desktop, the time would be set wrong each time as well (only the time though, not the date). Along the way I figured out my BIOS was getting reset on (probably) each boot. As a random idea I tried updating my BIOS to version F20, which didn't seem to do anything.\n\nSo yesterday, I committed and took everything apart to replace the CMOS battery. I'm really regretting this mini-ITX shit right now. Anyway, new battery, threw my rig back together, everything seemed okay and things ran just fine for the next 8 hours or so. Didn't notice anything strange when shutting down.\n\nToday, I come home from work, I fire up my PC, and nothing. No lights, no fans, no sounds. It's just dead. I can even feel it in how the power button clicks that there's nothing going on in there.\n\nWhen trying to diagnose the problem, the only observation I was able to make, is that the PSU makes a very quiet, continuous, rapid clicking sound when turned on, yet only when it's connected to the 24-pin. Strangely, the sound also persists after switching the power back off, until I disconnect the actual power cable. No idea what that means.\n\n**What I've tried:**\n\n* Using a different power cable: *No change*\n* Using a different outlet: *No change*\n* Reconnecting the power button to the motherboard: *No change*\n* Shorting the PWR+ and PWR- pins with a screwdriver: *Suspicious of my accuracy but no change*\n* Paperclip test: *PSU fan spins for a (literal) second, then stops. Likely the zero-RPM feature*\n* Shorting the CLR\\_CMOS pins with a screwdriver: *No change*\n* Discharging the capacitors: *No change*\n\nDid I brick the install of the new CMOS battery somehow? I used a Stanley knife to pry the spot-welded connectors off the old battery. One came off almost perfectly, the other end got nicked in places but was still in one piece. It's held together with electrical tape.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Gigabyte AORUS B550i PRO AX rev1.0\n* Corsair SF600 Platinum\n* AMD Ryzen 5 5600X\n* Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GAMING OC 8G\n* G.Skill 32GB DDR4-3600\n* ADATA SX8200 Pro, 2TB SSD\n\n**What I'm thinking of trying:**\n\nI'm gonna head out and get a multimeter tomorrow, see if the PSU is actually delivering the correct power. If the PSU is fine, I'll tear the whole thing apart again to check the CMOS battery. I have no idea how to diagnose the motherboard, though. Do I need to get an ammeter or something? I could also try reseating everything, I guess?\n\nAny insight is more than appreciated, I am quite frankly at my wit's end here.",

    "selftext": "Let me preface by saying that I rarely use Reddit, so please be nice lol.\n\nI have a PC that I built in late 2020 that has been giving me a weird issue for a while now.\n\nSpecs are  \nAMD 5900x  \nEVGA 3080 FTW3 (10GB)  \nSN850  \n4x8 G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4-3600 CL16-16-16-36 Samsung B Die.\n\nThe issue is Freezing at idle or doing simple tasks such as web browsing.  When the PC has a Youtube video playing, or while I'm gaming, Its runs perfect.  However it will often hard freeze once there's no videos or games playing. Only way back is to hold power button down to hard power cycle the pc\n\nI have\n\nVerified that all drivers/firmware are up to date.  \nTried every windows power plan (on balanced now as it is recommended for 5900x scheduling etc)  \nReseated my GPU  \nTried taking out ram and reseating  \nTried running dual channel A1/B1 and A2/B2 instead of occupying all 4 dimm slots.  \nTried BOTH XMP profiles  \nThoroughly Cleaned the PC (other than minor dust accumulation, everything was clean)  \nChecked all connections to MOBO and all Hardware  \nRan Benchmarks with HWMonitor open and temps/voltages all look great (Benchmarks always result with the PC running in the top 98th percentile or higher for my hardware)  \nNever overclocked anything. Closest thing would be enabling XMP profiles.\n\nThe issue went away for a few months over the summer but has since returned.  Event viewer shows nothing other than improper shutdown with no other details when the freezes happen.  Task manager never shows any crazy usage etc.\n\nI am beyond stumped and really just want to chuck this PC into a fire at this point.\n\nAny any all help is greatly appreciated!",

I tried some things like setting the resolution in steam launch options and forcing fullscreen but that doesn't seem to work as when I hover over the process it shows in the top left of the screen in a small window.\n\nI've tried to search around on google for a solution but haven't really been able to find anything relating to this specific issue no matter how I phrase the search and just kinda accepted it and didn't play the game. \n\nI've however recently bought Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on steam and was hoping to play it since I remember playing it when I was younger but I've run into the same issue now so I thought it may be worth a shot to ask in here if anyone knows what could be causing this and or how to fix it",

The codes are one time use only so I had to go to the lobby and get a new one. Now today same thing happened to my wifes phone again. Meanwhile I am still connected with no problems whatsoever. We are both using iPhones so I think this has to be some sort of setting. I just dont feel like explaining myself every other day at the reception, so I would like a fix for this.

    "selftext": "To preface this, I left my apartment for around a week. When I left, my PC was working with no issues. I come back, and when I turned on my PC all the hardware came on, then immediately turned off. On my MOBO it went from the DRAM light to the CPU light, and immediately turned off.\n\nI originally thought this was a PSU problem, and bought a new power supply (Corsair CX750M -> RM850x) Of course, no dice.\n\nI then checked my ram, and swapped it with a spare stick I had. Still the same problem. Then I thought it had to be the motherboard then, and I swapped my MOBO for the same model (Gigabyte B650 Eagle AX). Again, same problem.\n\nMy last ditch thought was that it could be a CPU problem, and I swapped my CPU for a new Ryzen 7 7800x3d. Once again, did not fix the problem.\n\nAt this point, I was just completely lost. I tried unplugging all my case’s headers, like the front panel, audio, and USB connectors. I then started the PC by shorting the power on pins with a screwdriver. The PC actually stayed on this time, but did not boot.\n\nA couple things I also tried was booting without the GPU. After this, I tried plugging the PC into different outlets to make sure it wasn’t just an outlet problem. Both of course did not work.\n\nThe MOBO light sequence started at DRAM, stayed there for around 20 seconds, went to VGA which instantly cleared, then went back to CPU where it stayed on with no boot or display. \n\nMy last ditch effort was thinking there was some sort of short here, and bought a NZXT internal USB hub. I kept this the only thing connected to MOBO usb wise, with again no case connectors. I plugged my AIO USB into here. Originally when I gave it SATA power, the radiator fans and GPU LEDS stayed permanently on, and when it went from VGA to CPU the PC would shut off and then not start again until I unplugged the PSU. \n\nThis led me to try once with it connected to the hub but giving it no SATA power once to the same result as before with it staying on the CPU light and not booting, but also not shutting off. I did that once then just plugged the AIO back into one of the mobos USB connectors to the same result.\n\nI tried multiple times reapplying the AIO pump to make sure it was getting even pressure and wasn’t overtightened. All of this has not worked, and now here I am.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas or knows what’s going on it would be well appreciated.\n\nMy build:\nNZXT H5 Flow\nGigabyte B650 Eagle AX (swapped for same board) \nRTX 2080 \nRyzen 7 7700x -> Ryzen 7 7800x3d (swapped)\nNZXT Kraken 360 \nCorsair CX750M -> Corsair RM850x\n32gb Crucial DDR5 5600MHz x2 16 sticks\nSamsung 990 Pro",

I came to my settings and found this sitting here. Storage hadn't been an issue before, and this sudden brick sitting in System & Reserved is new to me. Anyone have a proper fix? Been scouring the internet for a bit but I can't find anything effective for this.\n\nDevice is a Dell XPS 14 9440, bought summer 2024.",
