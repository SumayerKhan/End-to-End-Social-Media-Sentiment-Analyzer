    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

Staying healthy was becoming a second full-time job.\n\n**👉 So I built** [**Nori**](https://nori.ai)**.**\n\nNori is an AI health coach that connects all your health data (Apple Health, Oura, Whoop, Garmin, labs, whatever) and tells you what to actually do to get healthier.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Syncs all your wearables and health apps automatically\n* AI analyzes patterns across sleep, workouts, nutrition, biomarkers\n* Gives you personalized daily insights and recommendations\n* One conversation interface instead of 5+ apps\n\n**Real examples from my own data:**\n\n* I got stronger when I *added* rest days instead of grinding 6-7 workouts weekly\n* Magnesium at bedtime increased my REM sleep by 25%\n* When I miss a workout, it tells me exactly how to adjust\n\n**🙌 Giving away 25 free invites to readers of** r/apple **so you can try the app**.  \n**🍎 Use invite code APPLE.** \n\nI'm especially looking for Apple Watch users focused on weight loss, energy, or recovery.\n\nIf you try it, I'd love feedback—and an App Store review would mean a lot to me 🙏\n\n**App store link:** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nori-ai-own-your-health/id6746278715](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nori-ai-own-your-health/id6746278715)  \n**🍎 First 25 to try it - use invite code APPLE.**  (Update: this should work now, sorry!)\n\n**Website:** [https://nori.ai](https://nori.ai)\n\nThanks so much—really looking forward to hearing what you think!  \nDave",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Tracking devices, while designed to help users find their belongings in case of loss/theft, bring in new questions about privacy and surveillance of not just their own users, but in the case of crowd-sourced location tracking, even that of others even orthogonally associated with these platforms.\n\nApple's Find My is perhaps the most ubiquitous such system which can even locate devices which do not possess any cellular support or GPS, running on millions of devices worldwide. Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks.\n\nThis paper presents a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties.",

    "title": "iPhone & Wi-Fi 7",
    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7’s most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> • **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> • **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> • **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> • **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3–4× higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time — yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple’s iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism — effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it’s a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn’t support 240 MHz channels — but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple’s iPhones simply don’t take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple’s documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> • [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> • [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> • [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> • [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> • [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> • [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> • [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> • [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> • [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> • [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> • [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard. Apple’s current implementation delivers **minimal improvement over Wi-Fi 6/6E**.  \n>  \n> **If you’d like to see full Wi-Fi 7 features enabled on Apple devices, submit feedback via Safari:**  \n\n1.

    "title": "The iPhone Upgrade Program is absolutely NOT compatible with AppleCare One",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR: DO NOT try and add your iPhone Upgrade Program iPhone to AppleCare One, unless you want significant problems down the road.**\n\nI added my 16 Pro to AppleCare One in July, a few days after the program started. The support specialist read me boilerplate along the lines of \"In order to remain enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, you must immediately add your phone to AppleCare One to ensure no gap in coverage\". I did that, got a gift card back for \\~$120, and felt happy with myself.\n\nI successfully used the program to get a 17 Pro a few weeks ago, which I picked up in store. However, when I came to return the 16 Pro, the phone was marked as \"Enrolled in iPhone Upgrade Program\", but the option to close the loan was greyed out with \"loan details not found\". The store associates, up to and including supervisors were very confused by this and hadn't seen it before.\n\nAfter approximately **11 hours** on the phone with Citizens, and Apple Support, speaking with about 15 different people, all of whom were very friendly, but none of whom had any idea what had happened, and **3 visits** to the store, I was eventually advised to return the phone as a standalone trade-in, and receive a store gift card. I then had to call a special escalated support number and have them cancel the gift card and close the loan. (It still ended with a 4¢ balance, which I then had to pay Citizens by credit card 😅)\n\nI eventually had final confirmation from that escalated support line that, despite what AppleCare specialists tell you, and despite the boilerplate coverage language, cancelling the Theft and Loss protection to put your phone into AppleCare One **immediately** cancels the Upgrade Program eligibility. Obviously some systems are aware of this (allowing me to upgrade to 17 Pro), and some are not (preventing me from returning 16 Pro).\n\nI asked about the 17 Pro and confirmed that it too had been removed from the program. They advised me to do a Closed Box return in store and then immediately re-buy the same phone through the program to get it back into eligibility. I tried this, and while I passed the credit check and managed to keep my same phone, Verizon refused to activate the line (presumably because it was already connected - to me). As a result, I couldn't complete the transaction, and ended up having to re-buy my phone outright.\n\nTo Apple's credit, they recognized what a clusterfuck this was, and gave me a credit of $250, which I used for some AirPods Pro 3, and the guy in-store also gave me an Ultra Watch band for free. I also ended up with a negative loan balance of $260, which I got back as a check, and when you add back the $120 gift card back from July, I ended up doing ok. \n\nBut, it was an incredible time and energy suck and I did have to drop $1400 all in one go. I am lucky that I could just do that otherwise I would have left the store without my phone and then who knows what would have happened. I do not recommend this adventure to anyone. \n\nHopefully by the time the next phones are released there will be a proper integrated upgrade path, but for now, if you want to preserve your sanity, just stick with Theft and Loss coverage.\n\n ",

I've  had USB-C loosen over time and have seen them get destroyed by there hollow design but the lightning port was a plug that you didn't have to worry about as much and was easier to clean. Why at least not make it a little bigger on a redesign or something to compete? I like USB-C, but I was always curious why Apple never continued to innovate a good port and cash cow.",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

As soon as I attempt to connect to either their staff or guest WiFi it just goes into a loop of reconnecting or the WiFi restarting itself. Only had the phone for two days now but I haven’t noticed any issues at home, no changes with or without my AW. Apple support had me run some tests and check settings but nothing substantial yet. Might test how it works at my gym on the way home too.",

All her previous voicemails disappeared, and were wiped from the Verizon systems. \n\nNow, whenever people leave a voicemail, it shows all new messages twice, and after a day or so of them being in her mailbox, they disappear. The deleted messages folder has since appeared, however these disappearing messages aren’t even in the deleted folder. \n\nI’ve contacted both Apple and Verizon, and neither have any idea about this. I’ve also googled it and cannot find anything. Has anyone had this issue, or a solution?",

No way to turn it on again; it just died.\n\nIt had enaugh battery (around 30%) and battery health was at 99%, but even so I plug it in to check if that way it turned on... but no luck.\n\nAny idea what could happened?

    "title": "(Serious QC Issue)-Discovered a Heavy Blemish Upon Unboxing & Unacceptable Staff Response",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I just picked up my new iPhone 17 Pro Max from the Apple Store today and wanted to share a deeply troubling experience regarding a severe quality control (QC) issue and the store staff's highly unprofessional and illogical response.\n\nThe Situation\n * Product Pickup & Unboxing: I purchased and picked up the sealed, brand-new iPhone 17 Pro Max today and unboxed it at the store.\n * Heavy Blemish Discovery: Immediately upon taking the device out of the box, I noticed a very prominent, raised, and thick dried stain/smudge on the back panel, specifically below the camera island (on the silver/white metal area).\n * Staff Interaction & Response: I immediately brought this stain to the attention of an Apple Store employee, pointing out that a brand-new, sealed product should not have this kind of initial defect.\n   * Staff Action: Instead of following any official protocol (like reporting a QC issue or offering an exchange), the employee simply took the device and wiped the stain away with their cloth.\n   * Staff Statement: After wiping it, they handed it back, declaring it \"fine\" or \"no problem.\"\n   * Unacceptable Justification: When I pressed further about the underlying QC issue, the employee offered an explanation, citing what another (seemingly American) foreign employee had told me: \"This happens, though rarely, due to mass production and is sometimes seen.\" This felt like an attempt to normalize a clear defect and dismiss my valid concern.\n\nMy Logical Argument (Why this is a serious issue)\n\n * Fundamental QC Failure on a New Product:\n   * I paid full price for a brand-new, sealed device. The presence of a thick, dried, unknown liquid substance on the phone's exterior straight out of the box is unambiguous proof of a failure in Apple's pre-shipment Quality Control.\n   * This is not an issue I couldn't wipe off myself; the point is that the phone was contaminated at the factory or during the supply chain. A customer should not have to clean their $1,000+ premium device immediately after opening the box.\n * Staff's Improper Problem-Solving Protocol:\n   * I showed the staff the stain not to ask them to clean it for me, but to formally report a product defect.\n   * The correct logical steps for a significant initial defect on a new product should have been:\n     * Acknowledge the defect and file a QC report.\n     * Check inventory and offer an immediate exchange for a truly pristine unit.\n     * If no stock was available (which is what they claimed), offer a refund or an official replacement order, not a quick, dismissive wipe-down.\n   * Wiping the stain and saying \"it's fine\" is a logically flawed and irresponsible response that appears to be an attempt to cover up the issue rather than address the manufacturing flaw.\n * Breach of Trust & Potential Reseal/Refurbished Concern:\n   * This experience makes me wonder: How can I be certain this was a genuinely new unit and not a resealed/refurbished one if it comes with such an obvious physical contamination?\n   * The attitude displayed—dismissing a clear defect as a \"rare mass production thing\" and refusing an exchange due to lack of inventory—feels like arrogant business practice.\n\n“If you’re not satisfied with the phone you can return it in 14 days if we have it in stock but no guarantee”\n\nI am extremely frustrated and feel that my legitimate concerns about the quality of my newly purchased iPhone were completely disregarded. \n\nHas anyone else experienced such a severe initial QC issue or such a poor, illogical response from Apple Store staff? \n\n#iPhone17ProMax #AppleQC #QualityControlFailure #AppleStoreExperience #Blemish\n",

    "selftext": "I've been an android user for the past 10 years and currently use a Pixel 10 pro. It's fantastic and have no issues. However, I'm considering switching to an Iphone 17 pro and using the android for work instead. I have three children and 1 uses an iphone and 2 use an apple watch. I have to consistently bring both my work(iphone 14) and personal cell with me (android) and switch to the work iphone to track them in order to know when to meet them at the bus stop. The stop is not in my neighborhood since they attend school outside of our area and I do hit traffic getting there. In order to modify settings on their devices I need the iphone although not often. Regardless, it would be nice to have the ability to leave my work phone at home and just focus on one handset the majority of the time.  \n  \nMy concern is backing up information: I pay for 1-2 TB via google storage for both my photos and my back ups. This has already been paid for and I don't want to have to pay for icloud storage on top of this. I want to keep all of my photos on google photos. I know I can keep using google photos on the iphone but my concern is my back ups for text messages. Right now ALL back ups for photos, calls/texts are done using google and it goes to my google storage. The messages in particular go into a folder in my google storage or gmail. Can someone help me in understanding how I would back up my text messages on the iphone or if there is a way to continue using google storage for this? I don't think so but figured I'd ask.  \n\n",

    "selftext": "HELP!\nI have a stupid situation in which I factory reset my iPhone 12 to fix the Apple Maps storage glitch (was taking up 12GB of storage and climbing when I don’t even use the app, followed all protocol of deleting and reinstalling the app to get rid of the documents and data, but it didn’t work so lead me to final step of factory resetting) but upon reopening my phone it has been locked back to original carrier. \n\nFor context, I bought this phone 2nd hand 4 years ago. It had always been unlocked I have used multiple SIM cards in it and never had a problem, both in the US and in Europe. I am now in the UK but my sim has locked back to T-Mobile, which was apparently the original owners carrier, but i have no relation with them. I can no longer use my UK SIM card and am locked out of many accounts due to 2FA. \n\nAre there any UK based solutions on how to unlock my phone again??? Really frustrating that the fix to my minor inconvenience storage glitch (which should also be fixed by Apple) turned into a major inconvenience that is halting me from going on with my work.",

To be completely honest, the 17 pro max feels thinner than it looks in my hand and in my jeans pocket. Thus I am of the belief that in real life experience and everyday use, the feel in thickness between the pro/promax vs the air is negligible. What I mean to say is that when you’re holding both the pro and air at the store to compare, MAYBE you can feel the difference. But with everyday use, the I don’t think the difference is noticeable. With everyday use, I don’t think a pro/ pro max owner will wish it was any thinner than it already is. This is obviously without any case or cover, just a screen protector. \n\nSo… if you’re debating whether to go with the pro/promax or Air, my advice is go with the pro/promax. I gave the Air considerable time before I made my decision and I don’t regret going with the pro max. ",

I have not used anything MagSafe before. Is it safe to put a phone grip like a pop socket on the wallet attachment or would me holding it by the grip potentially make the wallet slip off the MagSafe case and therefore making me lose my grip on the phone? Should I just stick to a better iPhone card case? \n\nAny suggestions are appreciated. Thanks! ",

With the screen starting to pop out of the frame, I thought I would make the jump too. \n\nFrankly - I am ***amazed***. Yes, it has its caveats - the camera is fine. The single speaker isn't as powerful. The screen time is not as long lasting as the old phone. But, for my use it is **simply perfect**. I can point and take photos without any extra features. I can barely feel it in my hand or pocket compared to the toe-crusher my 13PM was. I can make it through a light use day with juice to spare - or simply connect it at work. It is snappy, responsive and is sexy in black with no case. \n\nIn summary, I think it is a perfect phone for those of us who need a phone for the **basics**. Yes, for a power user you will have drawbacks, but if like me you treat your phone as an accessory rather than an extension of your body - make the jump. You too will be amazed I think :) ",

    "selftext": "I used to use YouTube Music for mobile music stuff, but my premium subscription just expired and I'm delaying renewing it until I can figure out how VPNs work so I can renew it for the Turkish price. In the meantime, I need a new music player since it's basically useless with background play disabled.\n\nSo far, I've tried VLC player and Foobar 2000, but I've found both of them lacking. It's very difficult to customize the upcoming tracks. A \"play next\" and \"play last\" option would be really all I need. I mentioned Musicbee in the title because I really like it for how it functions, the UI and the fact it's free, but unfortunately the only ios app they have is some kind of remote that I don't see the point of.\n\nI'd like an app with those three same attributes, but I could justify spending some money if necessary. I haven't had much luck browsing through the app store since every other app has either ads, a subscription model or both, which I can't justify.",

    "title": "Weekly iOS Battery Support Megathread",
    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

No 16 Pro unfortunately only 17's.\n\nIs it possible for my USA carrier to transfer the Esim to my new phone without me having to go back to the united states? The apple store in Bangkok said there is nothing they could do about it other than setting up a new apple ID and getting a Thai sim card, which is not ideal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d4fpu0u3fwf1.jpg?width=3060&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e6d0e419ee976a625a3e393f852d1f626719c36\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9y6tcr1w3fwf1.jpg?width=3060&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54c3ebe62fd9b3efd0c96399f26cb8e5364f70a3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fh27nouf5fwf1.jpg?width=3060&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba7fc91aa805e125e09cb441569f9321797c7086",

We have filed a police report.\n\nDoes anyone know if there is something we can do to get this phone refunded? Why would Apple ship it without requesting signature on delivery?

I tried to switch off/on the wifi but the wifi switch was not working, so I though the iphone was freezed and I thought about just switched if off/on again. When I switch it off it did it and the screen turned off as usual BUT the first top line (where time/wifi and cel icon go) stayed visible for 10-20 seconds. Then phone switched off... and stay there. No way to turn it on again; it just died.\n\nIt had enaugh battery (around 30%) and battery health was at 99%, but even so I plug it in to check if that way it turned on... but no luck.\n\nAny idea what could happened?

However, I'm considering switching to an Iphone 17 pro and using the android for work instead. I have three children and 1 uses an iphone and 2 use an apple watch. I have to consistently bring both my work(iphone 14) and personal cell with me (android) and switch to the work iphone to track them in order to know when to meet them at the bus stop. The stop is not in my neighborhood since they attend school outside of our area and I do hit traffic getting there. In order to modify settings on their devices I need the iphone although not often. Regardless, it would be nice to have the ability to leave my work phone at home and just focus on one handset the majority of the time.  \n  \nMy concern is backing up information: I pay for 1-2 TB via google storage for both my photos and my back ups. This has already been paid for and I don't want to have to pay for icloud storage on top of this. I want to keep all of my photos on google photos. I know I can keep using google photos on the iphone but my concern is my back ups for text messages. Right now ALL back ups for photos, calls/texts are done using google and it goes to my google storage. The messages in particular go into a folder in my google storage or gmail. Can someone help me in understanding how I would back up my text messages on the iphone or if there is a way to continue using google storage for this? I don't think so but figured I'd ask.  \n\n",

I’ve been an iPhone user since the original was released in 2007, typically upgrading every 1-2 years, and I’ve never had second thoughts about a purchase. However, the battery life on the air is just not enough for me. \n\nI’m typically taking the phone off charger around 6am, and while sometimes I have some juice left when I go to bed around 11pm or so, many times it’s on low battery mode, or I have to top it off. I wouldn’t consider myself a power user, but I use my phone consistently throughout the day. The battery is at 100% capacity, and it’s struggling to keep up with my needs. It’s hard to imagine what it would be like at 90% capacity. \n\nWhen I couple the battery issues with the camera deficiencies and the single speaker, I’m left regretting my purchase. I do make calls on speaker sometimes, and the single speaker can make it hard to hear the person on the other end. I do like the form factor, and that is why I gave it a shot, but to have dramatically better battery/camera/speaker for only $100 more with the pro, I will be returning my air and purchasing the pro. I will miss having a lighter phone, but the tradeoffs on performance are simply not worth it. ",

The apple store in Bangkok said there is nothing they could do about it other than setting up a new apple ID and getting a Thai sim card, which is not ideal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d4fpu0u3fwf1.jpg?width=3060&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e6d0e419ee976a625a3e393f852d1f626719c36\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9y6tcr1w3fwf1.jpg?width=3060&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54c3ebe62fd9b3efd0c96399f26cb8e5364f70a3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fh27nouf5fwf1.jpg?width=3060&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba7fc91aa805e125e09cb441569f9321797c7086",

When I switch it off it did it and the screen turned off as usual BUT the first top line (where time/wifi and cel icon go) stayed visible for 10-20 seconds. Then phone switched off... and stay there. No way to turn it on again; it just died.\n\nIt had enaugh battery (around 30%) and battery health was at 99%, but even so I plug it in to check if that way it turned on... but no luck.\n\nAny idea what could happened?

However, I'm considering switching to an Iphone 17 pro and using the android for work instead. I have three children and 1 uses an iphone and 2 use an apple watch. I have to consistently bring both my work(iphone 14) and personal cell with me (android) and switch to the work iphone to track them in order to know when to meet them at the bus stop. The stop is not in my neighborhood since they attend school outside of our area and I do hit traffic getting there. In order to modify settings on their devices I need the iphone although not often. Regardless, it would be nice to have the ability to leave my work phone at home and just focus on one handset the majority of the time.  \n  \nMy concern is backing up information: I pay for 1-2 TB via google storage for both my photos and my back ups. This has already been paid for and I don't want to have to pay for icloud storage on top of this. I want to keep all of my photos on google photos. I know I can keep using google photos on the iphone but my concern is my back ups for text messages. Right now ALL back ups for photos, calls/texts are done using google and it goes to my google storage. The messages in particular go into a folder in my google storage or gmail. Can someone help me in understanding how I would back up my text messages on the iphone or if there is a way to continue using google storage for this? I don't think so but figured I'd ask.  \n\n",

    "title": "[PSA] Lost my phone, managed to get it back after an 18-kilometer chase, all without police intervention",
    "selftext": "***\\[Skip to the end for precautionary measures and to know how to track\\]***  \n  \nYesterday, while strolling around, my phone slipped out of my pocket as I crossed a speed bump. I noticed it had fallen but wasn't worried since it was only about 10 meters behind me. However, with three autos and a bit of a crowd around, I ended up losing it.\n\n# The Panic Phase\n\nI searched everywhere but couldn’t find it. I kept calling my number from a stranger’s phone on the road, along with my parents and sister trying to reach the device, but there was no response. After searching for about 15 minutes, it finally struck me to track my phone since I had taken all the precautionary measures to safeguard it in case it got lost (never thought they’d actually come in handy).\n\nI asked a random guy on the road to help track it. I logged into his phone using my email ID and password, and to my surprise, I was able to track it, but shockingly it is **located about 8 kilometers away from where I lost it**.\n\n# The Chase Begins\n\nI rushed home, grabbed my sister’s phone, and continued tracking. Luckily, I ran into my father on the way, and he quickly joined in. He was tracking while I was driving. We realized he was close to our location, but every time we approached, he moved further away. It felt like a movie for nearly 10 kilometers. Frustrated, we decided to skip a few stops. Suddenly, we lost the tracking signal (he must have hidden it somewhere where there's no network).\n\nAfter some waiting, it came back online - and this time, it was stationary. The location led us to an **automobile showroom**.\n\n# Caught Red-Handed\n\nWe went straight there and explained everything to the security guards, who were amazingly cooperative. They helped monitor everyone coming in and out while I kept checking the tracker. Meanwhile, the person who had ignored over 20 of my calls **suddenly called the emergency number** I’d set up on my lock screen, which I locked it remotely to secure the device - but didn’t speak a word. I was 100% confident he is somewhere nearby and aware that we were inquiring about him.\n\nOne of the guards took my phone while the call was still active and noticed faint noises in the background that matched the workshop area. Bingo, it is almost clear that he is in the place. I kept tracking the device and he is somewhere around but I'm not sure exactly, and all of a sudden, he left the place and went outside. Turns out, he is an employee in that company and **caught him red-handed** while he was trying to decline our calls.\n\nTurns out, he was an employee at the showroom. We reported him to the company’s CEO, who assured us that **strict action** would be taken.\n\n# What Saved Me (Precautionary Measures)\n\nHere’s what helped me recover my phone. These steps are simple but can make all the difference:\n\n* **Enable “Power Off Verification”**\n   * Prevents anyone from turning off or restarting your phone without your password.\n\n*Processing img jihf3od1xewf1...*\n\n* **Disable Quick Settings on Lock Screen**\n   * Stops thieves from pulling down the quick settings menu, so they can’t disable data or location.\n\n*Processing img x1g7nsr6xewf1...*\n\n* **Keep Mobile Data and Location Always On**\n   * Minimal battery drain, huge payoff. You can’t track your phone if these are off.\n\n*Processing img 55c8u818xewf1...*\n\n* **Enable Location Access for “Find My Device” / Find Hub**\n   * Make sure location services are allowed for this app so your phone can always be located.\n\n*Processing img cgx4adsa2fwf1...*\n\n# How to Track a Device from Another Mobile\n\n* All Android devices come with the **Find Hub app** preinstalled.\n* Just open it, select “Sign in as Guest”, and log in using the Google account linked to your lost device.\n* It won’t ask for two-step verification or additional confirmation, so you can access tracking instantly.\n* Once logged in, you’ll see all the devices connected to that account, and it will show you the real-time location of your lost device (as long as all the conditions mentioned above are met)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nDropped my phone while I was driving. Someone picked it up and tried to run off. I tracked it using Google’s Find My Device, followed the signal for a few kilometers, found it at a showroom, and caught the thief red-handed- who turned out to be an employee there.\n\nMoral of the story: **set up your phone’s security features before you lose it.** You never know when you’ll need them. It will save your shit ton of time circling around police stations.",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Samsung is canceling the upcoming s26 edge completly. but should it?\n\nCurrent reports say its because of poor sales of the 25 edge (only 178k in the first month) vs the other s series (s25 ultra with 1.5m, s25 with more than 1m). \n\nFor my opinion, the poor sales of the s25 edge were caused only because thats a new technology and it was mostly a prototype phone.\nIt had many problems and seemed rushed and unfinished (wasnt that thin, small battery, no telephoto camera). It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

    "title": "[Dev] Introducing Media Bar - Control media playback from your status bar with swipe gestures!",
    "selftext": "Hi all! I've been working on something I think you'll find useful. **Media Bar** transforms your Android status bar into a functional media controller and progress indicator.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nInstead of pulling down notifications or switching apps to control your music/podcast/video, you can now:\n\n* **See media progress** as a thin colored bar along your status bar\n* **Swipe left/right** on the status bar to scrub through your media\n* **Tap, double-tap, or long-press** three invisible regions on the status bar for custom actions (play/pause, skip, jump forward/back, launch app, etc.)\n\n**How is this different from Android's Live Notifications or OneUI's Now Bar?**\n\nWhile Android's live notifications and Samsung's Now Bar are excellent features, Media Bar takes a different approach:\n\n* **Always visible, minimal footprint** \\- Just a thin line on your status bar (can be as small as 1 pixel), not a pill or expandable widget that takes screen real estate\n* **Blind muscle memory control** \\- Your entire status bar becomes an interactive surface. No need to look for or tap specific small buttons\n* **Works system-wide** \\- Doesn't matter which media app you're using or which Android skin you have\n* **Swipe to scrub** \\- Directly scrub through your media by swiping, rather than tapping skip buttons\n* **Deep customization** \\- Color coding for progress tracking, custom button zones, transparency options, etc.\n\nThink of it as complementary to those features - it's for when you want the most minimal, muscle-memory-based control possible.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI found myself constantly interrupting my workflow to control media playback - whether I was gaming, browsing, or working. I wanted something that was always visible and accessible without being intrusive.\n\n**The \"aha\" moment:**\n\nHere's the thing - **Media Bar might feel a bit unusual at first, but give it a day or two.** Once your muscle memory kicks in, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n\nImagine this: You're at the gym mid-rep and need to pause your music. Instead of fumbling to find the play button, your thumb just *knows* where to tap on the status bar. Or you're deep into a 3-hour podcast and want to skip ahead - a quick swipe does it without even looking.\n\n**That's the magic**: your fingers learn the zones, and suddenly media control becomes second nature. No more hunting for tiny buttons or pulling focus from what you're doing. It just... flows. I'm confident that once it becomes part of your routine, it'll feel indispensable.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Color coding options** \\- Solid colors, dynamic (based on album art/app), segments (changes color at different progress points), or gradients\n\n**Highly customizable** \\- Adjust the bar's thickness (down to 1 pixel!), position (top/bottom), transparency, button regions, and more\n\n**Smart behavior** \\- Auto-hides in fullscreen apps, works with any media player\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, [get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.mediabar)! I would love to hear what you guys think about it and happy to answer any questions you may have! I would specifically like to hear if you build a muscle memory for it! :)",

    "selftext": "Yesterday, a particularly nasty bug caused by Google Play services started making Pixel users' lives a nightmare as many apps started hanging and crashing. the issue seemed especially bad on the Pixel 10 line for some reason. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977488699291213936\n\nHere's the post from /r/GooglePixel about this issue: https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1o4rz9j/pixel_10_pro_apps_crashing/.\n\nAnd from /r/Android: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1o5f5ou/pixel_10_users_report_random_app_crashes_after/.\n\nSince this bug essentially nuked my phone, I alerted Google to it right away and provided several bugreports and stack traces. The issue got escalated to an incident this morning.\n\nWell, I just got news that Google thinks the Pixel hanging/crashing apps bug is now fixed. I've asked for clarification on whether the fix is server-side or requires a Play Services update. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977868145840050230\n\n**Update**: Alright, got confirmation that the Pixel crashing/hanging apps fix is server-side. There will be a post-mortem within Google, but I'm not sure if it will be made public. Incidents like this one cannot happen again. The Android System Intelligence issue is still being worked on. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977877354082087048",

    "title": "[PSA] Lost my phone, managed to get it back after an 18-kilometer chase, all without police intervention",
    "selftext": "***\\[Skip to the end for precautionary measures and to know how to track\\]***  \n  \nYesterday, while strolling around, my phone slipped out of my pocket as I crossed a speed bump. I noticed it had fallen but wasn't worried since it was only about 10 meters behind me. However, with three autos and a bit of a crowd around, I ended up losing it.\n\n# The Panic Phase\n\nI searched everywhere but couldn’t find it. I kept calling my number from a stranger’s phone on the road, along with my parents and sister trying to reach the device, but there was no response. After searching for about 15 minutes, it finally struck me to track my phone since I had taken all the precautionary measures to safeguard it in case it got lost (never thought they’d actually come in handy).\n\nI asked a random guy on the road to help track it. I logged into his phone using my email ID and password, and to my surprise, I was able to track it, but shockingly it is **located about 8 kilometers away from where I lost it**.\n\n# The Chase Begins\n\nI rushed home, grabbed my sister’s phone, and continued tracking. Luckily, I ran into my father on the way, and he quickly joined in. He was tracking while I was driving. We realized he was close to our location, but every time we approached, he moved further away. It felt like a movie for nearly 10 kilometers. Frustrated, we decided to skip a few stops. Suddenly, we lost the tracking signal (he must have hidden it somewhere where there's no network).\n\nAfter some waiting, it came back online - and this time, it was stationary. The location led us to an **automobile showroom**.\n\n# Caught Red-Handed\n\nWe went straight there and explained everything to the security guards, who were amazingly cooperative. They helped monitor everyone coming in and out while I kept checking the tracker. Meanwhile, the person who had ignored over 20 of my calls **suddenly called the emergency number** I’d set up on my lock screen, which I locked it remotely to secure the device - but didn’t speak a word. I was 100% confident he is somewhere nearby and aware that we were inquiring about him.\n\nOne of the guards took my phone while the call was still active and noticed faint noises in the background that matched the workshop area. Bingo, it is almost clear that he is in the place. I kept tracking the device and he is somewhere around but I'm not sure exactly, and all of a sudden, he left the place and went outside. Turns out, he is an employee in that company and **caught him red-handed** while he was trying to decline our calls.\n\nTurns out, he was an employee at the showroom. We reported him to the company’s CEO, who assured us that **strict action** would be taken.\n\n# What Saved Me (Precautionary Measures)\n\nHere’s what helped me recover my phone. These steps are simple but can make all the difference:\n\n* **Enable “Power Off Verification”**\n   * Prevents anyone from turning off or restarting your phone without your password.\n\n*Processing img jihf3od1xewf1...*\n\n* **Disable Quick Settings on Lock Screen**\n   * Stops thieves from pulling down the quick settings menu, so they can’t disable data or location.\n\n*Processing img x1g7nsr6xewf1...*\n\n* **Keep Mobile Data and Location Always On**\n   * Minimal battery drain, huge payoff. You can’t track your phone if these are off.\n\n*Processing img 55c8u818xewf1...*\n\n* **Enable Location Access for “Find My Device” / Find Hub**\n   * Make sure location services are allowed for this app so your phone can always be located.\n\n*Processing img cgx4adsa2fwf1...*\n\n# How to Track a Device from Another Mobile\n\n* All Android devices come with the **Find Hub app** preinstalled.\n* Just open it, select “Sign in as Guest”, and log in using the Google account linked to your lost device.\n* It won’t ask for two-step verification or additional confirmation, so you can access tracking instantly.\n* Once logged in, you’ll see all the devices connected to that account, and it will show you the real-time location of your lost device (as long as all the conditions mentioned above are met)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nDropped my phone while I was driving. Someone picked it up and tried to run off. I tracked it using Google’s Find My Device, followed the signal for a few kilometers, found it at a showroom, and caught the thief red-handed- who turned out to be an employee there.\n\nMoral of the story: **set up your phone’s security features before you lose it.** You never know when you’ll need them. It will save your shit ton of time circling around police stations.",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

    "title": "[PSA] Lost my phone, managed to get it back after an 18-kilometer chase, all without police intervention",
    "selftext": "***\\[Skip to the end for precautionary measures and to know how to track\\]***  \n  \nYesterday, while strolling around, my phone slipped out of my pocket as I crossed a speed bump. I noticed it had fallen but wasn't worried since it was only about 10 meters behind me. However, with three autos and a bit of a crowd around, I ended up losing it.\n\n# The Panic Phase\n\nI searched everywhere but couldn’t find it. I kept calling my number from a stranger’s phone on the road, along with my parents and sister trying to reach the device, but there was no response. After searching for about 15 minutes, it finally struck me to track my phone since I had taken all the precautionary measures to safeguard it in case it got lost (never thought they’d actually come in handy).\n\nI asked a random guy on the road to help track it. I logged into his phone using my email ID and password, and to my surprise, I was able to track it, but shockingly it is **located about 8 kilometers away from where I lost it**.\n\n# The Chase Begins\n\nI rushed home, grabbed my sister’s phone, and continued tracking. Luckily, I ran into my father on the way, and he quickly joined in. He was tracking while I was driving. We realized he was close to our location, but every time we approached, he moved further away. It felt like a movie for nearly 10 kilometers. Frustrated, we decided to skip a few stops. Suddenly, we lost the tracking signal (he must have hidden it somewhere where there's no network).\n\nAfter some waiting, it came back online - and this time, it was stationary. The location led us to an **automobile showroom**.\n\n# Caught Red-Handed\n\nWe went straight there and explained everything to the security guards, who were amazingly cooperative. They helped monitor everyone coming in and out while I kept checking the tracker. Meanwhile, the person who had ignored over 20 of my calls **suddenly called the emergency number** I’d set up on my lock screen, which I locked it remotely to secure the device - but didn’t speak a word. I was 100% confident he is somewhere nearby and aware that we were inquiring about him.\n\nOne of the guards took my phone while the call was still active and noticed faint noises in the background that matched the workshop area. Bingo, it is almost clear that he is in the place. I kept tracking the device and he is somewhere around but I'm not sure exactly, and all of a sudden, he left the place and went outside. Turns out, he is an employee in that company and **caught him red-handed** while he was trying to decline our calls.\n\nTurns out, he was an employee at the showroom. We reported him to the company’s CEO, who assured us that **strict action** would be taken.\n\n# What Saved Me (Precautionary Measures)\n\nHere’s what helped me recover my phone. These steps are simple but can make all the difference:\n\n* **Enable “Power Off Verification”**\n   * Prevents anyone from turning off or restarting your phone without your password.\n\n![img](jihf3od1xewf1)\n\n* **Disable Quick Settings on Lock Screen**\n   * Stops thieves from pulling down the quick settings menu, so they can’t disable data or location.\n\n![img](x1g7nsr6xewf1)\n\n* **Keep Mobile Data and Location Always On**\n   * Minimal battery drain, huge payoff. You can’t track your phone if these are off.\n\n![img](55c8u818xewf1)\n\n* **Enable Location Access for “Find My Device” / Find Hub**\n   * Make sure location services are allowed for this app so your phone can always be located.\n\n![img](cgx4adsa2fwf1)\n\n# How to Track a Device from Another Mobile\n\n* All Android devices come with the **Find Hub app** preinstalled.\n* Just open it, select “Sign in as Guest”, and log in using the Google account linked to your lost device.\n* It won’t ask for two-step verification or additional confirmation, so you can access tracking instantly.\n* Once logged in, you’ll see all the devices connected to that account, and it will show you the real-time location of your lost device (as long as all the conditions mentioned above are met)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nDropped my phone while I was driving. Someone picked it up and tried to run off. I tracked it using Google’s Find My Device, followed the signal for a few kilometers, found it at a showroom, and caught the thief red-handed- who turned out to be an employee there.\n\nMoral of the story: **set up your phone’s security features before you lose it.** You never know when you’ll need them. It will save your shit ton of time circling around police stations.",

Also, I use gestures for navigation (swipe left instead of the back button).\n\nNow to the problem: in my previous Pixel experience (as well as with One UI), when I have Gboard open and want to close it, I simply swipe from left in any part of the screen. With Android 16, however, the swipe left does not close Gboard if done over Gboard. It doesn't work with the \"one hand\" keyboard view either.\n\nTo close the keyboard I need to swipe left in a place above the keyboard or use the down arrow. This is extremely annoying, since I have to overstretch my thumb to reach above the keyboard what ends up moving the phone and requiring my right hand assistance.\n\nI have triple-checked the settings but could not find out how to solve this one.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

After having the 17 pro since release day, I could no longer put up with the stuttering UI and lesser photography compared to others I have had. Switching to the 10 pro I immediately could tell the software and UI is a lot smoother. Like a finished software compared to Apple ongoing bug fixes. I could also tell the photography is way ahead of Apple in daylight and poor lighting. Of course nothing beats the 17 pros videography. But overall I feel the Pixels are coming up quick on Apple and I feel like my 1,000 dollars is better spent for n the Pixel this year which is surprising due to me being Apple since the X.

To her fault she does toss her phone in her purse with her keys...but that's expected design scenario-she's an average user. She's had many phones, both with and without screen protectors. None of them have ever looked like this. She has an iphone for work (no protector) and it looks great. Honestly I was shocked, she gave me her phone to login to an app and I noticed this. We ordered screen protectors for both sides but the damage is done. Purchased brand new less than 6 months ago.\n\nThis isn't meant to start a flame war, it's a PSA.

Let me explain. \n\nuTorrent or Bittorrent app\nIf I want to download anything over mobile as soon as I start downloading I see my data literally turns off and back on again, off , on, off, on.\n\nUber Drivers app:\n\nIn the Uber app, customers sometimes can call you instead of here voice. They can use data to call and when they do that instead of receiving a phone call I'm getting a call via Uber app using data and when that happens exactly the same thing happens my data goes off then on , off then on again. In the Uber when you go flying it shows you offline with the red mark and when you go online it show you as a green Mark and that's exactly what I see. Red green, red green, red green and obviously I cannot connect to customer and I don't hear anything. \n\nThird and final instance when it happened to me is my online doctor appointment. I'm using doxy.me to connect to my doctor and when I am online in the queue waiting for a doctor. Everything is fine but as soon as doctor connects and video and audio starts streaming from him and from me to him I'm getting exactly the same thing data goes off and then back on again constantly until I drop the call. As soon as I drop the call it stops, data goes back in, and it's happening in the chrome because to connect I just go to the website doxy.me/doctorroomname and that's it.\n\nPlease help !\n\nPS \n\nI am on Pixel 10 Pro XL latest public non beta build. Just FYI. Whatever I mentioned just now. Previously I was on 9 Pro XL and everything was great on that phone so I'm not sure what has happened but this is very annoying and I don't know what to do.",

They said I also had to pay a fee ranging from $0 - $99.00 in addition to it.\n\nMy last question is they said for \"other damages\" I would have to pay for parts, do I also have to pay for the labor?

I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation. Even standard stabilisation copes perfectly well with normal walking.\n\n  \n2) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 30fps + HDR +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because of the benefits of the Video Optimization mentioned above (clearer image).\n\n3) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 60fps + HDR not available +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because the additional 30 fps do not provide any additional benefit, except that the size of the video becomes larger.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I was thinking of returning it because even though I like the bigger screen for bigger view on apps... the actual apps themselves aren't robust in taking full advantage of them like you get in a tablet, or even the galaxy fold 7.\n\nFor example, many apps I cannot open more than 1 instance at a time, error keeps saying app can be only open in 1 window.  Only some like chrome can once it detects dual screen, but this is very limited.\n\nI SWEAR the Samsung galaxy fold 7 somehow forces these apps for dual screen, or even have a pop up feature.\n\n  \nNot to mention, even though I got use to the camara on the pixel 10 fold, the pixel 10 pro still outshines it.  At least its better than the Galaxy fold 7, which is why I haven't switched to it.\n\n  \nI know this is android, I know there has to be ways or methods to make it work on this pixel 10 fold.  Otherwise If very limited to one screen on majority of the apps I use, I might as well return it and get a regular pixel or invest in a galaxy fold 7, even with the botched cameras.\n\n  \nAny ideas, or suggestions? Anybody played with developer options and see what it has?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Story time... after a couple of weeks to one month of use, can't recall, I was thinking that the battery for my new Pixel 10 Pro was truly bad. \n\nReading people's options here in reddit was only confirming - \"I was fkd, why the hell did I left my iphone?\" - From 80% at 7 am to 25% at 10 pm, not that much use 2 to 3 hours SOT.\n\n Contacted support, we found out that my Google app  was going wild. Deleted cache and storage. Restarted the phone. Reset voice match. Put it to change no limits, 100% all night. It is 9:40 pm and I still have 74% - 2:10 SOT.Wow! I am not saying that it is out of this world battery life, but the difference is too big! What the hell happened!? \n\nI commute 60 minutes and the phone is connected to the car, but barely charges. Same as last month.\n\nSo for anyone there facing the same, maybe try to delete data from the Google app and let it charge all night to 100%? No clue how might that be related, but it was the only thing I did different from the previous weeks.\n\nI would post a screenshot, but I can't, it is greyed out.",

I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

    "title": "1 Month Review of Google Pixel 10 Pro - Disappointing for the price, Don't Buy Yet",
    "selftext": "I Bought this phone for my mother who previously had a Pixel 8. She liked the phone overall and was complaining about the battery and it freezing occasionally. She doesn't use her phone for much besides content and communication, so I thought that and the fact she's already in the ecosystem, I'd by her a 10 Pro. After a month of use we're both going to return the phone and try to buy something like a s25+ or 17 pro. Here's my honest review\n\n**Pros**\n\n* *UI/Software -* Phone feels great to use, UI is responsive and visually appealing. I genuinely think it has the best UI out of any phone currently\n* *Hardware -* Feels premium in the hand, a bit heavy but overall the screen, cameras, buttons, charging, and finger print reader keep up with the other phones of the same price and what I'd expect for paying $1k+\n* *AI -* Didn't use too many of the features since it's not my phone, but when I did use it it was all really impressive. The AI photo tools are surprisingly good and useful, and Gemini is miles ahead of other phones, giving actual response (unlike Apple \"Intelligence\")\n\n**Issues**\n\n* *Battery -* For comparison, I have a 2 year old 15 pro max with 80% battery health, I have on average 2 more hours screen time than her on the pixel, and I occasionally game on the 15 pro max. We'd end the day and I'd have more battery almost always compared to her. You should still be able to get through a day of moderate use with a Pixel, but it's a bit lackluster compared to other phones right now.\n* *Freezing -* My mom would mention an app freezing every other day, and in some cases you'd even have to full restart the phone for the app to work. She uses her phone a lot for work, and when your apps keep crashing it makes the entire experience frustrating. I expect maybe in a few months some updates will fix this issue\n* *Google Apps -* Youtube has a decent amount of issues when it comes to going fullscreen, sometimes freezes. Google Maps was the biggest problem. When using it the location and direction were so inaccurate that it was literally unusable(not exaggerating). I tried debugging both, but they are updated and still have issues. You'd expect Google apps to work on a Google Phone, but they both work better on my Iphone.\n\nOverall I really like the Pixel, and was actually looking to switch my phone over after my current one breaks or gets old, but the issues are too glaring. The last straw happened today, her phone was on the lock screen, but completely frozen, the time and notifications were visible, the fingerprint reader was functional, but as soon as you open the phone you're met with a black screen. A restart fixed the issue, but at this point after a month of complaints I think it will just be best if we replace it with a different phone. I think most of the issues will be fixed eventually with updates, but also keep in mind I spent $1100. I don't see the appeal for wanting the current pixel unless you really love the AI features it has. The pixel is slower, has worse battery life, and has more bugs as compared to other phones its price. If you use your phone primarily for photos/social media and don't use game, I'd say wait a few months for them to update them, otherwise I'd avoid buying this phone. I have high hopes for Pixel, however, and hope they can fix the issues in future generations.\n\nThanks for the read, I'll try to answer any questions",

They advertise that their case works with PixelSnap and even has product photos of it using a stand, but it's false advertising and their case doesn't work at all with PixelSnap accessories.\n\nThey also have a return policy of 30 days and when I reached out, their automated emailing system said it would be 24 hours before they would get back to me and that never happened. I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what? I finally got a response and they are having me pay for shipping the case back with me just putting a return number in the package. There's not real official return process outside of that \n\nTLDR: The Ghostek Pixel 10 Pro Fold case is a scam and doesn't work with PixelSnap.",

I read that it is a known issue on this phone and started a ticket via Google.

That I did not have the phone was always in a protecting cover. They wanted 150€. I couldn't even get more info, had 2 options. Pay for the repair or send the phone back to me. \n\nOf course I chose to send it back, I have not received any more information. It's been 10 days with no info. Today I finally got hold of someone at Google and they just said the same thing again and again. They will escalate the issue. Could not tell me where the phone is, if it is sent or not, if it is lost or not. Just that they will escalate and hopefully I will be contacted via e-mail within 48h.\n\nI loved my pixel 8, almost bought the new one. Instead am typing this on my Samsung now. ",

However this is not always available to me so I have to use my phone. Never satisfying as it never works as well as I need it to. \n\nNow I've had the Swype keyboards from earliest days on my Samsung galaxy s2 though various android phones too my P9 now. It got ok but then kind of lost the plot.\n\n I've tried the Google gesture typing. I've tried typing each letter and use autocorrect but jeez how many times do I have to make sure the language is English UK and it still passes English US spelling. How hard is it to remember to use grey, colour, etc??!!\n\nThen there's the gesture types of keyboards. The first one I used you did a loop over a letter you doubled snoop, loop, etc has a squiggle over the letter o. It worked years ago on older phones but it's been going wrong on my last two or three phones.\n\nThen there's the note taking app itself. It's so difficult to put in formatting to highlight say bullet points, underlining or highlighting. I've used basic notes through to onenote, and those competitors like evernote, keep, etc.\n\nSo my question is twofold, what is the best way to put notes down into the memory of your phone via an input method? Secondly, what is a really good and efficient note taking app that allows efficient ways to put thoughts or notes down with formatting to emphasis points as needed? \n\nThe first I am limited by not wanting voice input method. The second is limited by not wanting to spend that much on it. Also, little notebook isn't helpful for me as I want to not carry such things on the off chance I'm going to need it when there's a phone with me all the time. It's a phone based option I need \n\nI hope people have ideas to help me here ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m facing a serious provisioning issue after an *official motherboard replacement* of my **Pixel 9 Pro (Hazel, 512 GB, original SKU: GEC77)**.\n\nMy phone unexpectedly stopped powering on in Sept. Since there’s no official Google service center in my country, I took it to a **Google-authorized service center in Singapore** during a business trip, where the staff replaced the motherboard.\n\nAfter the repair, I verified that the phone had **two valid IMEIs**, and the system is **Android 14**.\n\nHowever, after returning home and updating to **Android 16**, I suddenly received an email saying that my phone was **blacklisted** after several days of use.\n\nWhen I checked *#06#*, I was shocked to find that both IMEIs were **gone** — replaced by a **single IMEI shared by both SIM slots**.\n\nI checked this new IMEI at [imeipro.info](https://www.imeipro.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and it was **indeed blacklisted**, listed as an **old Nokia device**.\n\nIn addition, my Google account now shows this phone as a **Verizon Pixel 9 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB)** and system properties report the **SKU as “unknown.”**\n\nBased on these findings, I believe the **replacement motherboard was never fully provisioned** — the IMEIs were *soft-provisioned* during the repair but never *permanently burned* into the protected area. After the Android 16 OTA, a fallback IMEI used, which happens to be part of a **globally blacklisted** IMEI.\n\nI’m currently living in a country without a Google repair center and can’t travel again soon.  \nI’ve already contacted Google Support, but they could only suggest visiting an authorized region in person.\n\n👉 **Request:**  \nPlease escalate this as a *post-repair provisioning defect*.  \nI need confirmation that my case will remain eligible for a **delayed re-provisioning fix** (IMEI re-burn or change a new board) once I’m able to visit an official repair region.\n\nThanks to anyone from the **Google Repair or Pixel Hardware team** who can help flag this internally.",

Presenting this transcript made no difference. Google refused to do absolutely anything to defuse this situation. \nIn the end I decided to return the tablet. That way Google is paying for shipping and refurbishing this tablet. I could care less at this point. \nSilver lining is that I got Galaxy Tab 10 lite instead and couldn't be happier.

Switching to the 10 pro I immediately could tell the software and UI is a lot smoother. Like a finished software compared to Apple ongoing bug fixes. I could also tell the photography is way ahead of Apple in daylight and poor lighting. Of course nothing beats the 17 pros videography. But overall I feel the Pixels are coming up quick on Apple and I feel like my 1,000 dollars is better spent for n the Pixel this year which is surprising due to me being Apple since the X. Also the liquid glass is not my cup of tea personally, it feels like too many people developed it and too many ideas mashed together to make a software fruit salad. ",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

I'm finally back to Pixel with a 10 Fold. \n\nI'm a traditional keyboard user, ie I type, no gliding. Also, I use gestures for navigation (swipe left instead of the back button).\n\nNow to the problem: in my previous Pixel experience (as well as with One UI), when I have Gboard open and want to close it, I simply swipe from left in any part of the screen. With Android 16, however, the swipe left does not close Gboard if done over Gboard. It doesn't work with the \"one hand\" keyboard view either.\n\nTo close the keyboard I need to swipe left in a place above the keyboard or use the down arrow. This is extremely annoying, since I have to overstretch my thumb to reach above the keyboard what ends up moving the phone and requiring my right hand assistance.\n\nI have triple-checked the settings but could not find out how to solve this one.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation. Even standard stabilisation copes perfectly well with normal walking.\n\n  \n2) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 30fps + HDR +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because of the benefits of the Video Optimization mentioned above (clearer image).\n\n3) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 60fps + HDR not available +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because the additional 30 fps do not provide any additional benefit, except that the size of the video becomes larger.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device’s screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A €500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn’t I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google’s assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can’t even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen’s problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle’s written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don’t know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I’ve been for months without my phone, and it’ll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google’s abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. 🙂",

    "selftext": "Just giving a fair warning to y'all who may be looking for a phone case for your Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Avoid buying from Ghostek. They advertise that their case works with PixelSnap and even has product photos of it using a stand, but it's false advertising and their case doesn't work at all with PixelSnap accessories.\n\nThey also have a return policy of 30 days and when I reached out, their automated emailing system said it would be 24 hours before they would get back to me and that never happened. I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what? I finally got a response and they are having me pay for shipping the case back with me just putting a return number in the package. There's not real official return process outside of that \n\nTLDR: The Ghostek Pixel 10 Pro Fold case is a scam and doesn't work with PixelSnap.",

I'm getting a protection plan for my phone and I'm debating between TMobile 360 and Pixel Care.\n\n I know T Mobile is expensive, but I've called and chatted online with Google representatives and I haven't gotten a straight answer.\n\nI know Google covers the front, and back glass and battery with zero deducitble. but does it also cover past warranty the same way?\n\nAlso if the damage is beyond just a scratch it said I had to pay a fee of $59.00 as the service fee is that right? They said I also had to pay a fee ranging from $0 - $99.00 in addition to it.\n\nMy last question is they said for \"other damages\" I would have to pay for parts, do I also have to pay for the labor? And if they cannot repair do I just get a replacement?\n\nAre there any gotchas?\n\nI apologize I'm just looking for a much information as possible before I make a decision. Or even if T-Mobile protection is even freaking worth it haha and Google is just better",

After having the 17 pro since release day, I could no longer put up with the stuttering UI and lesser photography compared to others I have had. Switching to the 10 pro I immediately could tell the software and UI is a lot smoother. Like a finished software compared to Apple ongoing bug fixes. I could also tell the photography is way ahead of Apple in daylight and poor lighting. Of course nothing beats the 17 pros videography. But overall I feel the Pixels are coming up quick on Apple and I feel like my 1,000 dollars is better spent for n the Pixel this year which is surprising due to me being Apple since the X. Also the liquid glass is not my cup of tea personally, it feels like too many people developed it and too many ideas mashed together to make a software fruit salad. ",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

Also, I use gestures for navigation (swipe left instead of the back button).\n\nNow to the problem: in my previous Pixel experience (as well as with One UI), when I have Gboard open and want to close it, I simply swipe from left in any part of the screen. With Android 16, however, the swipe left does not close Gboard if done over Gboard. It doesn't work with the \"one hand\" keyboard view either.\n\nTo close the keyboard I need to swipe left in a place above the keyboard or use the down arrow. This is extremely annoying, since I have to overstretch my thumb to reach above the keyboard what ends up moving the phone and requiring my right hand assistance.\n\nI have triple-checked the settings but could not find out how to solve this one.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "to make a long story short, i work at a computer repair shop, and we often have people come in with cellphones, which we almost always direct over to the local cellphone repair shop. we have an agreement that if we get a cellphone repair request we send them to their shop, and if they get a laptop repair request they send them to our shop\n\nbut with the issues where people are having with samsung galaxy ring batteries swelling, im not sure if i should send them to the cellphone repair shop, or the hospital.\n\nthis isnt a joke meme post, ive just heard that hospitals have a hard time removing the rings because of the nature of the battery in the ring meaning the ring cant just be cut off in the normal way they would a stuck ring, so im really not sure what to do in that situation\n\ni dont have anything much aganst samsung, asside from the annoyance of apps with the appliances my landlord has recently installed in our apartment (im not a fan of needing an app to access all the features of my stove) cause samsung phones are not bad, not the best option in my opinion but if you have the money to spend they are the apple of the android world and so i get it.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I preordered the Z Flip 7 the 20th of july, while there was the promotion of the free galaxy buds pro 3 while giving my Z Flip 6 for trade in, so i ended up paying around 380€ for the phone, earbuds and galaxy Watch 8 Classic.\n\nIt's been a month and a half, the site said it would've been sent by the 4th of August but still my order is \"pending\" on their site with no update since they got my money on july 20th. I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

My one singular complaint about the 7 (I don't even care about the cost at this point because you know what you're getting) is the fact that you can't set it down on a table and not have it rock awkwardly.  The pixel figured this out a long time ago.  Is there some weird licensing thing that stops Samsung from making an obvious design choice?  Are they just that desperate to sell cases?  For the life of me, I can't see the upside to configuring it the way that they do.",

I didn’t realize how convenient this machine might be when I bought this (costco deal!) I’ll def check in later in a couple months with quirks. If you’re an engineer that worked on this product - thank you!\n\n1. Loads a bunch of wash fluids (detergent & such). Back saver. \n2. I just set and forget. Literally can get a load done overnight!! Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I’m going to start to train to load and start. ",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I’ve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

Can’t wait to see if it motivates me or just roasts me for my “brisk walking” pace.\n\nBut seriously, can someone explain why some of these new features aren’t available on the other Galaxy Watches?\nSame sensors, same everything — but nope, Samsung said “you can look, but you can’t touch.”\n\nHaving Facer back is great though. I’ve already changed my watch face three times today because apparently commitment isn’t my thing.\n\nAlso, the grouped notifications — chef’s kiss. Finally, my wrist doesn’t look like it’s having a notification panic attack.\n\nOverall, One UI 8 feels like a solid glow-up. Just wish Samsung didn’t sprinkle in that classic “you can’t have this yet” energy.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

    "selftext": "I was discovering the features of the One UI 8 on the Galaxy Watch 7, and I expected that, given that they delayed the update for 3 months compared to the rest of the watches that support this feature, it would be supported so that they could wait for the new watches to be sold and then release them to the public, but wow. They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

It turns out the first-party straps from Samsung are just 22mm watch straps attached to a lug adapter.\n\n------\n\nBackstory: I had been using third-party strap adapter for this watch. I noticed a bit of flimsiness and a bit of clang as my arm moves. This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

But after several registration attempts, I kept getting error codes 4001 and 5000.\n\nI went to the Globe Business Center at SM North EDSA, where they told me the service was not yet available, even though it’s already on their website. I also checked with the Samsung Service Center, and they said the same thing — it’s still unavailable. Feeling disappointed, I realized I was misled by outdated information.\n\nNearby, I visited the Smart Telecom Center, where they introduced me to Device Link, their version of Globe One Number. They suggested I apply for a Smart postpaid plan and use Mobile Number Portability (MNP) to keep my Globe number.\n\nThe approval was quick. I went back to Globe to settle my balance, terminate my open-contract plan, and process the number transfer. Then I returned to Smart, where they immediately activated my postpaid and Device Link service.\n\nIt was a frustrating start with Globe, but everything went smoothly once I switched to Smart — and now my watch works perfectly.",

I just long pressed both buttons, and it displayed the logo and said rebooting, but just went blank afterward. I tried long pressing the lower button as well as the top button separately, but nothing happens now. Is the battery dead? Is the battery replaceable and would I have to contact Samsung to get it replaced?\n\nDoes anyone know if the band is swappable with the Watch 7? I bought a Watch 7 earlier this year, but hated its super uncomfortable bulky tank tread band, so returned it. It also didn't offer me anything over the AW2 as I really only use the watch to see the time and answer phone calls (notifications are somewhat half-assed useless as I still have to tell it to display on my phone - especially FB notifications).",

They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

I noticed a bit of flimsiness and a bit of clang as my arm moves. This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

Can’t wait to see if it motivates me or just roasts me for my “brisk walking” pace.\n\nBut seriously, can someone explain why some of these new features aren’t available on the other Galaxy Watches?\nSame sensors, same everything — but nope, Samsung said “you can look, but you can’t touch.”\n\nHaving Facer back is great though. I’ve already changed my watch face three times today because apparently commitment isn’t my thing.\n\nAlso, the grouped notifications — chef’s kiss. Finally, my wrist doesn’t look like it’s having a notification panic attack.\n\nOverall, One UI 8 feels like a solid glow-up. Just wish Samsung didn’t sprinkle in that classic “you can’t have this yet” energy.",

    "selftext": "I was discovering the features of the One UI 8 on the Galaxy Watch 7, and I expected that, given that they delayed the update for 3 months compared to the rest of the watches that support this feature, it would be supported so that they could wait for the new watches to be sold and then release them to the public, but wow. They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

I noticed a bit of flimsiness and a bit of clang as my arm moves. This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

Can’t wait to see if it motivates me or just roasts me for my “brisk walking” pace.\n\nBut seriously, can someone explain why some of these new features aren’t available on the other Galaxy Watches?\nSame sensors, same everything — but nope, Samsung said “you can look, but you can’t touch.”\n\nHaving Facer back is great though. I’ve already changed my watch face three times today because apparently commitment isn’t my thing.\n\nAlso, the grouped notifications — chef’s kiss. Finally, my wrist doesn’t look like it’s having a notification panic attack.\n\nOverall, One UI 8 feels like a solid glow-up. Just wish Samsung didn’t sprinkle in that classic “you can’t have this yet” energy.",

    "selftext": "This is the first time I'll be purchasing my own personal laptop, so I'll be needing some guidance and good recommendations. My budget is around 50-60k Indian Rupees (586-681 Dollars) which I can increase upto 70k (795 dollars) if it's really required and within that I need a laptop which is not only great for students but also can provide me good editing experience (not a pro editor), great graphics and a more than decent gaming experience as well (even if not a gaming experience like a pure gaming laptop). Well basically I am a student who needs for mostly projects, basic editing, student's purpose and a medium casual gamer, although even tho I mostly do casual gaming but on somedays I can do hardcore gaming for long hours and that too high graphic games, so the gaming performance does matter to me as well even tho I'm a casual gamer and not a hardcore gamer in general. At first I had my eyes on Samsung Galaxy book 4 intel i7 13th Gen 1335U, it's a great laptop with great specs, ui, features and provides more than decent gaming experience on medium graphics. Honestly probably the best laptop for students at this price point but the reason on why I'm hesitant to buy is because it's 1335\"U\" which stands for ultra low power, although I need a processor starting from \"H\" high performance or HS or HX, but most preferrably H or HS, as the HX processors laptop drain a lot of battery due to its extreme desktop level performance. Also the galaxy book 4 doesn't even has dedicated nvidea genforce rtx graphic cards but comes comes with integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, neither it has a dedicated graphic memory capacity. Lenovo LOC is a bit above the budget but I was still willing to purchase it considering it's all arounder ability, great gaming, cooling system and dedicated rtx 3050 but considering that it's processor is i5 13th Gen 13450\"HX\" so it's not efficient for normal tasks as it's gonna drain a lot of battery even in normal tasks and even more in gaming 🥲, the battery life is gonna be a nightmare for me as someone who's gonna buy this laptop for mostly \"student\" and other casual uses, also the thermals are quite poor, and the laptop heats up very quickly plus let's not forget that there have been multiple reports of motherboard failure in the LOQ series as well. So please give your helpful valuable recommendations to me, so that I can choose the best laptop suitable for my need and won't have any regrets 🙏🏼. My minimum required specifications are:- \nRam - minimum 16gb with minimum of 3200MHZ\nProcessor - starting from Intel i5 13th Gen(minimum) and should be H (High performance) or HS (but more power efficient than H)\nGraphics card - minimum of Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 with minimum dedicated graphic memory capacity of 4GB\nSSD- the SSD generation should be minimum of Gen.4\nTDP- should have decent TDP numbers\n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

I have a PC that I build myself almost a year ago so I know PC parts a bit but when it comes to laptops I'm fully lost, lol. \n\nQUESTIONNAIRE:\nTotal budget (in local currency) and country of purchase\n\nNot sure.\n\nAre you open to refurbs/used?\n\nIdk, probably yes if what I need ends up being too expensive new but tbh new does feel a little safer so idk.\n\nHow would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?\n\nI probably need relatively good performance, though idk to what extent. I'm not sure tbh\n\nHow important is weight and thinness to you?\n\nI'm not sure how much I'll need to carry it around uni but ideally it shouldn't be too big/heavy\n\nDo you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\n\nN/A\n\nAre you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\n\nI do need to be able to use cad programs though I'm not sure which ones. I've used creo parametric before but idk which program they'll use in that uni. I would like to be able to play games but realistically I don't need anything too much when I'm comes to that. I also draw and I would like to be able to do that. I currently use clip studio paint. \n\nIf you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\n\nNot sure. I don't need to best settings or fps but I don't want to feel too limited if I do want to play something, that's all.\n\nAny specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\n\nNot sure.\n\nLeave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\n\nSince I have a PC at home, I will only really be using this for like 6 months on my Erasmus and then maybe once in a while if I just happen to need a laptop for something. So I want it to be good and I don't want to just get a really cheap one necessarily but also getting a really good, really expensive one feels like a waste.\n\nI don't necessarily just need specific recommendations but also if you have any more general advice in terms of what I should probably look for or what just what sounds like it would be ideal for me that would be very helpful. I don't feel like I know what I need enough to be able to get specific recommendations tbh, lol\n\nAlso, I was looking a little bit into framework laptops, just because for me a big part that I liked about building my own PC is that I now know exactly what's in it and I can upgrade things and repair/change things if I need to. So I don't need to rely on someone else to fix it and even if I do I can understand enough to not have to just blindly trust them. So having that in a laptop sounds really good but idk if it's worth it.",

    "selftext": "Hello! This is my first time in this subreddit so apologies for any inconveniences.\n\nSo lately I've been looking for a new laptop and I've stumbled upon these.\n\n--------------------------------------------\nMSI Thin 15.6 inch FHD 144Hz Gaming Laptop Intel Core i5-13420H\n\nLenovo LOQ 15IAX9\n\nAcer Nitro V Gaming Laptop\n\nASUS Vivobook 16 Lapto\n--------------------------------------------\n\nMy budget is around 900usd\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a laptop that:\n\n1. A strong one that can handle multi tasking, work and also gaming ( I'm not really a heavy gamer but I might play a heavy game once in a while )\n\n2. Doesn't have cooling issues. I've heard alot about laptops having loud fans or heating up quickly.\n\n3. Has a good screen in terms of the amount of hertz and also quality and colors.\n\n4. I want it to be light so not too heavy.\n\n5. I want it to have 512gb of storage minimum and also expandable in case I need to expand it later.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSo basically I was just wondering if you can take a look at the ones I've listed and see if they would be a good fit for me. I'm also open to any suggestions so if you have any other recommendations go ahead. Also, one final thing. I would prefer if it's new and not refurbished.\n\nThanks in advance!",

That seems strange to me — I thought low cycles should mean almost no wear.\n\nCould this be a sign of battery degradation from storage or something else?\nThe laptop looks clean otherwise, and performance seems great for my use (browsing, work, and light gaming).\n\nShould I worry about the battery, or is this perfectly fine for a used laptop?\n\nThanks in advance for your opinions! 🙏",

I've got a strict budget of £150 and know I wont get anything spectacular, but I'm sure I should be able to get something older but usable second hand for that price. So could you guys give me some tips on what specs I should be keeping an eye out for as minimum?",

    "title": "Need help in choosing a suitable laptop for me as a first time laptop buyer.",
    "selftext": "This is the first time I'll be purchasing my own personal laptop, so I'll be needing some guidance and good recommendations. My budget is around 50-60k Indian Rupees (586-681 Dollars) which I can increase upto 70k (795 dollars) if it's really required and within that I need a laptop which is not only great for students but also can provide me good editing experience (not a pro editor), great graphics and a more than decent gaming experience as well (even if not a gaming experience like a pure gaming laptop). Well basically I am a student who needs for mostly projects, basic editing, student's purpose and a medium casual gamer, although even tho I mostly do casual gaming but on somedays I can do hardcore gaming for long hours and that too high graphic games, so the gaming performance does matter to me as well even tho I'm a casual gamer and not a hardcore gamer in general. At first I had my eyes on Samsung Galaxy book 4 intel i7 13th Gen 1335U, it's a great laptop with great specs, ui, features and provides more than decent gaming experience on medium graphics. Honestly probably the best laptop for students at this price point but the reason on why I'm hesitant to buy is because it's 1335\"U\" which stands for ultra low power, although I need a processor starting from \"H\" high performance or HS or HX, but most preferrably H or HS, as the HX processors laptop drain a lot of battery due to its extreme desktop level performance. Also the galaxy book 4 doesn't even has dedicated nvidea genforce rtx graphic cards but comes comes with integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, neither it has a dedicated graphic memory capacity. Lenovo LOC is a bit above the budget but I was still willing to purchase it considering it's all arounder ability, great gaming, cooling system and dedicated rtx 3050 but considering that it's processor is i5 13th Gen 13450\"HX\" so it's not efficient for normal tasks as it's gonna drain a lot of battery even in normal tasks and even more in gaming 🥲, the battery life is gonna be a nightmare for me as someone who's gonna buy this laptop for mostly \"student\" and other casual uses, also the thermals are quite poor, and the laptop heats up very quickly plus let's not forget that there have been multiple reports of motherboard failure in the LOQ series as well. So please give your helpful valuable recommendations to me, so that I can choose the best laptop suitable for my need and won't have any regrets 🙏🏼. My minimum required specifications are:- \nRam - minimum 16gb with minimum of 3200MHZ\nProcessor - starting from Intel i5 13th Gen(minimum) and should be H (High performance) or HS (but more power efficient than H)\nGraphics card - minimum of Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 with minimum dedicated graphic memory capacity of 4GB\nSSD- the SSD generation should be minimum of Gen.4\nTDP- should have decent TDP numbers\n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "TLDR; PC crashes during cpu stress tests, all other tests and stressing can run fine.\n\nHi, this is my first post in a place like this so let me know if I am better suited in a different place.\n\nI'll post my specs first and then explain the problem and all I have done to troubleshoot.\n\nCPU: Intel i5-12600KF\n\nGPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3060ti\n\nRAM: 32 GB (2x 16GB) DDR5 6000 MHz Corsair\n\nPSU: 850W SFX\n\nMB: Gigabyte B760I Aorus Pro Mini\n\nrunning windows 11\n\nI bought the PC from some guy on facebook about a year ago and didn't have much problems for a while but then after about 6 months it started crashing during gaming, like elden ring. I have been troubleshooting ever since and cannot find the culprit. I just want to find out whats crashing so I can replace hardware, or fix settings so I can use the pc again.\n\nSome more info about when it crashes: I noticed the crashes happened after about 10-30 minutes of gaming, sometimes it would freeze up, sometimes it would just shut down, and sometimes it will BSOD. If I find the error in event viewer it always says a kernel-power with an event ID of 41. Sometimes if it BSODs It will show a stop code of \"IRQL not less or equal\" and sometimes I think it would say something related to a memory error. I started running stress testers and my gpu will run fine for a while using Furmark, but if I run its CPU stress test, the pc crashes after a couple minutes. I tested my RAM using memtest86 and they passed all 4 tests. I downloaded Windows XTU and it again crashes after a couple minutes when running its CPU stress test. I am happy to provide any file logs if needed. I downloaded the most recent BIOS update for my MB and have reset to defaults as well, still crashing. I have the intel CPU driver and NVIDIA gpu driver installed. Sometimes after crashes it won't turn back on unless I physically reset the boot CMOS. I believe this doesn't happen anymore after BIOS update but its hard to tell. CPU and GPU temp always remain within normal temperatures as well.\n\nIs there any good way to figure out exactly whats wrong in this case? I mainly want to know if this is something that I can figure out or if I should give it to someone to diagnose and repair. This is my first PC.\n\nI understand it could be a settings error, or faulty RAM/MB/CPU still and I am happy to replace what I need if its physical. I JUST NEED TO KNOW.",

    "title": "Research Server: 5090 vs L4 vs L40S with 40k€ budget",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: Is it possible to put 8x RTX 5090 in a single 4U Rack? Does anyone have experiene with L4 and/or L40 cards?\n______________\n\nFirst of all: Sorry if this is against sub rules, but /r/buildaserver is completely dead, so I figured I might as well post here. So mods: Please feel free to remove if this content is not wanted.\n\n_______________\n\nThat being out of the way:  \nOur research group has a private compute cluster with 4x A100 GPUs, however, as we've gotten more people, this simply isn't enough anymore. I noticed however, that most of us don't even remotely make use of the 80GB VRAM these cards are capable of. Our workloads usually demand <20GB of VRAM, but could benefit greatly from more cards to run more simulations in parallel (parameter sweeps). That's why I have been pushing to buy many smaller cards for our next purchase instead of one or two big ones. And since it is my idea and also because I probably know hardware best out of our group, it has fallen to me to configure the thing. The thing is tho: Besides some LTT videos, I have zero experience with server hardware (and so does the rest of our group). So here are my **constraints**:\n\n- Has to be rack-mounted\n- Has to be air-cooled (it will be put into a big server room that has a nice cooling infrastructure)\n- approx. 40k€ budget (unfortunately we are not tax-exempt and have to pay 20% VAT, but this is not a hard limit - it just gets less likely it will get approved by our funders)\n\nSome additional information:\n\n- No software support needed (we have a software genius in our group that can handle setting up the server no problem)  \n- It'd be great if we got a completed system tho\n- Good warranty would be very nice also\n- We do **not** pay for electricity ourselves\n\nWith all that, I have basically got 3 options I think: \n\n- 8x RTX 5090\n- 8x L4\n- 4x L40S\n\nSo I would love to just put 8x RTX 5090 in the server and be done with it, but I haven't found any big server builders that build their systems with gaming GPUs and I am afraid if I buy from a no-name that the system will not function due to cooling issues. 8x 5090 at full tilt, two powerful CPUs and all the rest, we might be looking at 5000+ Watts, right? Are air-cooled 4U even prepared to handle that much heat?\n\nL4 and L40S are proper server GPUs, so we hopefully wouldn't have that issue, but the question is which one to take and I am tending towards the L4, since they are 3x as cheap as the L40S while being only 2x slower, and as I said, most of us don't use more than 20GB of VRAM anyway. But with the L4 we kind of \"waste\" that we do not need to pay for our electricity. But does anyone have experience with either of these cards? Because just from the specs it seems the gaming cards are a way better offer - if it weren't for the potential cooling issues...\n\n________________\n\nAnyway, long story short, this is the system I have currently configured with 8x L4s on supermicro that comes in just under 40k€ after VAT:\n\n| Component | Qty | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Chassis** | 1 | Supermicro AS-4125GS-TNRT 4U Rackmount H13 GPU SuperServer |\n| **CPU** | 2 | AMD EPYC™ Turin 9375F Processor 32-Core 3.85GHz 256MB Cache (320W) |\n| **Memory** | 12 | 32GB DDR5 6400MHz ECC RDIMM Server Memory (2Rx8) |\n| **M.2 SSD** | 1 | 480GB M.2 22x80 7450 PRO NVMe PCIe 4.0 3D TLC (1 x DWPD) |\n| **NVMe SSD** | 1 | 7.68TB 2.5\" CD8-P NVMe PCIe 5.0 Solid State Drive (1 x DWPD) |\n| **GPU** | 8 | NVIDIA® Ada L4 24GB GDDR6 PCIe 4.0 Graphics Card (70W) |\n\nAnd then we'll also throw in 2x 20TB HDDs ourselves in the 2 front bays, since you cant configure HDDs on supermicro for some reason (or more likely: ask them to do it for us). I figured one small M.2 SSD for boot and then a bigger one for fast storage is also good.\n\nWhat do you think? Are the CPUs enough to feed all 8 GPUs?  \nIf we can get another 10k€ (so 50k€ total after VAT) I'd really like to future proof a bit and get some Turin 9575F 64-cores instead and upgrade from 384GB RAM to 768GB. Because, while we don't do a lot on CPU, some of us will inevitably want to use this server as a CPU server also and this'd be a rather \"cheap\" upgrade for more than 2x the performance",

I have a working PC now though it's quite old - I received it from a good friend for a really good price when i was pc-less a few years back. I've upgraded the RAM and GPU over time.\n\n Current specs below:\n\n* [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/QpF94p](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/QpF94p)\n\nI generally have a game running alongside a browser with video or something. I play star citizen, cyberpunk 2077, new world, things like that. Sometimes I'll stream if i want to show something off to friends. I live in the US, near a micro center, best buy, etc... \n\nPerformance-wise,  I seem to be bottlenecked at CPU, then memory, then gpu. So, i'm looking at starting with the CPU and going from there which means a lot of parts will get replaced. But Im going to save money by repurposing the parts I can for now like the PSU, case, OSdrive. \n\nI *think* a solid upgrade for me would look something like the next partpicker list below, but i've fallen into the ryzen 5 7600x3d vs ryzen 5 9600x black hole and now i don't know which direction to go lol. Maybe there's a ryzen7 that outperforms both at or near the same price point?\n\n* [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6cFVxg](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6cFVxg)\n\nI'm setting my CPU/MOBO budget at \\~$400. (never mind the price of the cpu and mobo in the pc parts picker link, there are numerous options for the 7600x3d  at or under $200)\n\nHappy to hear suggestions on a GPU around $400 that will go well with this build for the future.\n\n  \nThanks!\n\n",

But the more I thought about it the less true that became.\n\nIt is true that newer and non optimized titles need more than 8gb, but is there really anything that is equal or better in that 9060 xt 8gb price range? You can find the powercolor model for 270 in amazon. Excluding games that need more than 8gb, it destroys anything else in price to performance. I cant even find an equivalent in the used market for that price.\n\nIf it later in its life drops to around 250, wouldnt it just be the defacto card, the 16gb version is significantly more expensive at 350 USD.\n\nSo, im asking, is it actually that bad? And what price do you think it needs to be to be good?\n\n  \n  \nSome extra stuff. Im thinking of upgrading at some point in the next year and so it my friend, so we are looking for gpus. We have massive import taxes on items over 200. Anything over 200 has a 20% tax added so a 250 USD card becomes a 300 USD so the lower the better.

Before you guys say anything, I want to rehash again, I know building a laptop is difficult, but I want to see if I can, so again, dont mention it, I know.\n\n(PS: I apologize for the typos, I typed this quickly)",

    "selftext": "**Hey folks,**\n\nBattlefield 6 has officially put me into the low-end bracket of PC gaming, and I’ve somewhat accepted that fact by now. 😅\n\nAfter trying out many different settings, I’ve realized it’s time to stop dreaming and start upgrading.\n\n**Here’s my current system:**\n\n* **Mainboard:** MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 3700X\n* **GPU:** 8GB Gainward GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Phantom GS\n* **RAM:** 32GB G.Skill DDR4-3200\n* **PSU:** 550W be quiet! Straight Power 11 Modular 80+ Gold\n* **Case:** be quiet! Dark Base 700\n* **Cooling:** Corsair Hydro Series H100i Platinum + be quiet! Silent Wings 3 PWM\n\nI believe that my cooling setup is pretty solid, so it should have enough headroom for new hardware?\n\nThe first thing I already did: I replaced my 34-inch 60 Hz LG monitor with a 32-inch HP 165 Hz gaming monitor. Now my average FPS hurts even more - ouch! 😅  \nI did that to lower the resolution load on my system (and because the monitor itself is just way better overall).\n\nI’ve run a bunch of in-game benchmarks and attached some screenshots. To me, they don’t paint a clear picture of what the actual bottleneck is — but from what I’ve read on Reddit, it’s mainly the CPU, closely followed by the GPU. Basically, both are struggling.\n\nI've uploaded them here: [https://imgur.com/a/bwKQrOV](https://imgur.com/a/bwKQrOV)\n\nI’d love to get your opinion on the screenshots, maybe you can interpret them better than I can and give me some advice on good *budget* upgrade components.  \nUnfortunately, I have no idea whether a new GPU would fit in my case, if my PSU would be enough, or if my mainboard would still be compatible, and so on.\n\nI’m thinking about upgrading the CPU to something like a *Ryzen 7 5800XT or 5800X (Cost around 150 and 160 €)*, and the GPU to something from AMD or Nvidia for like 350 €.\n\n***Does an upgrade of like 500 € help me in my use-case for Battlefield 6 and upcoming games like GTA?***\n\nI’m from Germany, so prices here might differ from other regions.\n\n**Thanks a lot!**",

Thankfully it was off at the time.\n\nI have been trying to fix it, and I am pretty sure that the mobo is still good, but now it is bootlooping. So far I have:\n\n* Removed power supply (not going to re use for obvious reasons)\n* Removed GPU which took the brunt of the water\n* Removed everything from the motherboard but didn't unplug cpu, figured that if water was in there the whole thing was done anyway.\n* Removed water and dried using hairdryer\n\nThen I started replacing with spare parts. I don't care about retaining graphics or performance, files and use of a computer is more important.\n\n* Replaced PSU with old 450W (never had problems with it in the past but it is a low quality Corsair bronze from ages ago)\n* Replaced GPU with spare 1060 (this is the setup I used to run before)\n\nReconnecting everything outside the case, the computer came back to life!! files were there and everything was fine.\n\n* I then put the CPU cooler back on (with new paste) which was the most damp as dust inside it had absorbed water.\n* re-attached all the PSU cables back in the case\n\nThen, I turned it on forgetting to connect the GPU power supply, but it gave an error message saying to power down and attach the 6 pin pice. \n\nI reconnected the pcie, and the computer turned on. It then was acting strange; certain usb ports were not working, I had to switch things around for the keyboard and mouse to work. If I had the mouse in USB-1 and plugged something in to USB-2, the mouse would stop working. This is the moment I got very worried as turning the PC then suddenly turned off, and turning it on again would cause it to turn off shortly after. Since then I have tried:\n\n* Re-seating ram\n* Changing CMOS battery\n* Running with only one ram stick\n* unplugging and re-plugging power connectors\n* unplugging all drives except for the boot drive\n\nUnfortunately none of it had any effect and the PC still turns on only momentarily. I am about to strip it down and re-build it outside of the case so any suggestions would be great. Thank you.\n\nP.s. if I got a new PC entirely, would my hard drive files be safe? I had an SSD for booting and a hard drive with my files. Are they gone forever now?",

I do active trading and charting, usually have 100+ edge browser tabs open, twitch streams running (watching, not streaming), discord, an RDP session, maybe even a local zoom meeting, and the occasional light gaming session, though I don't care about 4K. Games might be open in the background potentially while all those other things are still open. I will have at least 3 monitors.\n\nI already have an MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk motherboard that I got for a good price, so that part is locked in unless there is a compelling reason to change it.\n\nHere’s the rest of the planned build:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9700X 3.8 GHz 8-Core Processor\n* CPU Cooler: ARCTIC Liquid Freezer III Pro A-RGB 360 77 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler\n* Motherboard: MSI MAG X870 TOMAHAWK WIFI ATX AM5\n* Memory: Corsair Vengeance 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory\n* GPU: MSI GAMING TRIO OC GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB Video Card\n* Storage: Samsung 990 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\n* PSU: Corsair RM750x (2024) 750 W Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\n* Case: NZXT H5 Flow (2024) ATX Mid Tower Case\n\nCouple things I’m wondering:\n\n* Is 32GB RAM enough for this kind of workload, or would 64GB actually make a noticeable difference?\n* Any bottlenecks in this build that might become a problem later on?\n* Are 8 cores in the 9700x sufficient or should I move up to the 9900x with 12 cores?\n* I don’t need a monster GPU, but I also don’t want to regret not going up a tier in a year or two. Is the 5060 Ti a solid choice here, or should I bump up a tier (5070 12GB?) for smoother multitasking and a bit more longevity?\n* Not planning on overclocking — just want something stable and quiet. I would also prefer something that doesn't generate a ton of heat. \n\n\n\nTrying to strike a balance between smooth multitasking and not overspending on stuff I won’t use. Any advice from folks with similar setups or experts in the field would be awesome. Thank you!",

It's my first AM5 build so i'm not entirely sure what i'm doing wrong. At stock speeds, my PC was constantly running into BSOD problems related to memory (MEMORY\\_MANAGEMENT, etc) so i'm just taking a good guess that there is something wrong with my RAM.\n\nMost importantly I couldn't get my RAM stable on anything higher than **2400MHz** (1200 DRAM Frequency) and I really don't have a clue what to do. When I was unable to post, I cleared the CMOS with the button on the back of the motherboard so I could reset the settings to default. If anyone can provide a better way to troubleshoot that'd be great. I'd be happy to provide any more useful information if it can help.",

Basically my pc was bought prebuilt and it worked fine. \n\nI upgraded the ram and GPU and again it worked fine for about a week. I was trying to play Cod ranked and Valorant and had to enable TPM 2.0 or something like that but my motherboard didn't have that option as it needed an update.\n\nI updated the bios and it booted up fine I went straight back into the bios and checked the version and the new version was there, I then turned on TPM 2.0 and when I rebooted the computer after saving the changed my pc would boot but with no display and mouse/keyboard RGB not working. All case fans spin, all case RGB including ram lights up, but still not display.\n\nThe motherboard I had at the time didn't support onboard graphics so I bought a new one in hopes I could then get back into the bios that way and just reset the settings however the new mobo still has no display with both onboard and via GPU.\n\nI've reset the CMOS about 10 times on both boards. I've reseated the GPU and RAM. I've tested 2 sets of ram 1 slot at a time and 1 stick at a time. I've tried booting with GPU and CMOS out.\n\nAny suggestions? I've tried using a different monitor and two different TVs as output also and it's a brand new monitor so that's not the issue or the cables.\n\nI don't have a second computer so I can't get into the bios to see what's going on that way.\n\nPc boots up still no display no matter what I try, the new mobo now shows RGB with the mouse but not keyboard and all other case fans and RGB still working.\n\nI've tried different HDMI cables etc and it's always the same.\n\nGTX 1650 OC\nCorsair CX 750\nHM310 MOBO + Asus hm110-plus\nI5 6400 CPU \n2x 8GB HyperX ram 3200 ",

I will hear (through my headset) a pretty loud EEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR like a static noise. I'll have to turn my PC off, and then turn it back on and it'll just work again. \n\nThis will only happen with certain games, and *never* others. It's never happened with Tarkov or dayz or dark and darker, but it has been happening with arena breakout infinite and star citizen. It also also *never* happened when there are no games open. \n\nThere is another issue, where, OBS will constantly crash if I am recording. In my 2 most recent posts I have my 2 most recent OBS crash logs. I fully uninstalled and reinstalled it and it crashed again. \n\nStuff I have done to try fix this: \n\nUpdated all drivers to latest version \n\nDid clean driver install \n\nUpdated bios to latest version \n\nRan CPU and GPU stress tests sperately and at the same time (nothing looked abnormal to me)\n\nUsed project lasso to disable some e-cores which games apparently try to use sometimes (tried with this off and on)\n\nDisabled windows game-boost thingy (I don't remember what it's called) in the windows settings \n\nI would very much like to know what the problem is. Or be able to perform a test to identify the problem. \n\nA while ago AMD would constantly crash, sometimes causing a game crash, and sometimes causing a whole pc crash, but that doesn't happen anymore. \n\nI have also tried overclocking and not changing any default settings, and it crashes with both settings. (Though I haven't tried overclocking since doing a clean reinstall of the amd drivers). \n\nPeople have told me (on other posts) that it's my \"faulty processor\", suffering from degraging. But I don't see why some games would literally never crash, or why I have never crashed when watching YouTube and stuff or while editing or programming. \n\nI also don't feel like purchasing a new processor if I'm not very certain that that is the issue. \n\nAny assistance would be very appreciated!\n\nNote: this isn't a new build.

So i can go with 9060xt and stick to the current psu, or go take any of the 9070 gpus which requires a stronger power supply, so another 100$.\n\nHere are the prices in my country for more details:\n\n9060xt 16gb - 435$  \n9070 - 665$  \n9070xt - 760$\n\nNow I have saved enough cash to go with any of the three (perks of being grown up) it's just I have never spent that much on a PC before (this 6600 cost me 350$ and thats it). Also, I do have power outages in the area, like once or twice every year, so I'm just tripping that it might damage my components as well...

What CPU would pair good with them? Is Intel Ultra 7 or 9 series good? or go with a Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9? I haven't played any AAA games past few years, only 2-3 games on a PS5 Slim. I like RPG and FPS genre (Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon, GTA 5 and Call of Duty). I am thinking something around $1900-$2000. Should I:\n\n1. Spend all of that on a PC build to use with my LG G4 TV (65 inch), I am also thinking about selling it to downsize to a 48 inch C5 or a 55 inch G4/Sony A95L.\n2. Spend less, build something with a AMD 9700 or RTX 5070 and take the rest of the budget toward a Sony or similar  OLED monitor at 2K 120 or 2K 240 Hz.\n3. Spend less, still use my 4K 120 Hz TV, sell my i7-11800H / RTX 3070 laptop, build a PC and the rest spend on getting a decent non-gaming laptop for office work/ study or movie on the go.",

    "selftext": "My friend made me a question the other day \"which is better 4060 ti 8gb or 9060 xt 8gb?\" I instantly said neither, 8gb of vram is enough and surely there is something better in the used market for that price. But the more I thought about it the less true that became.\n\nIt is true that newer and non optimized titles need more than 8gb, but is there really anything that is equal or better in that 9060 xt 8gb price range? You can find the powercolor model for 270 in amazon. Excluding games that need more than 8gb, it destroys anything else in price to performance. I cant even find an equivalent in the used market for that price.\n\nIf it later in its life drops to around 250, wouldnt it just be the defacto card, the 16gb version is significantly more expensive at 350 USD.\n\nSo, im asking, is it actually that bad? And what price do you think it needs to be to be good?\n\n  \n  \nSome extra stuff. Im thinking of upgrading at some point in the next year and so it my friend, so we are looking for gpus. We have massive import taxes on items over 200. Anything over 200 has a 20% tax added so a 250 USD card becomes a 300 USD so the lower the better. If you have any recommendations for what cards are good right now, new or used im all ears.",

I have analysis paralysis from all the research and I'm hesitant to pull the trigger for fear of messing up and getting a bad monitor.\n\nHere are my system specs:\n\n* Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700K CPU @ 3.80GHz, 3792 Mhz, 8 Core(s)\n* Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n* Monitors: (2) Asus VG278 & 1 Asus VE278\n* KVM Switch to move between work & home use\n* Xbox Series X tied into 1 of the 3 monitors\n* Lenovo ThinkPad T490 (for Work, will be switched to Dell Latitude 5450)\n\nI currently have flat monitors, but the curved ones are very attractive and seem like they'd be a good fit for my desk and all around. I currently have all 3 arranged in a line but can easily re-arrange to put 1 long monitor on the bottom and two additional ones on top of that.\n\nMy budget is $500 - $700 total.\n\nThe monitors that stand out so far are:\n\n* Asus VG27WQ3B\n* AOC C27G4H2 \n* Sceptre C275B Series\n* Dell G2524H\n* AOC Q27g3xMN\n\nMy main concern is to get something that will last a while, at least through my next PC upgrade and that I can see the text clearly. I have over the counter readers now because my monitors are not easy to read when working in excel for long hours.\n\nWhat would you recommend that I purchase?",

I have been troubleshooting ever since and cannot find the culprit. I just want to find out whats crashing so I can replace hardware, or fix settings so I can use the pc again.\n\nSome more info about when it crashes: I noticed the crashes happened after about 10-30 minutes of gaming, sometimes it would freeze up, sometimes it would just shut down, and sometimes it will BSOD. If I find the error in event viewer it always says a kernel-power with an event ID of 41. Sometimes if it BSODs It will show a stop code of \"IRQL not less or equal\" and sometimes I think it would say something related to a memory error. I started running stress testers and my gpu will run fine for a while using Furmark, but if I run its CPU stress test, the pc crashes after a couple minutes. I tested my RAM using memtest86 and they passed all 4 tests. I downloaded Windows XTU and it again crashes after a couple minutes when running its CPU stress test. I am happy to provide any file logs if needed. I downloaded the most recent BIOS update for my MB and have reset to defaults as well, still crashing. I have the intel CPU driver and NVIDIA gpu driver installed. Sometimes after crashes it won't turn back on unless I physically reset the boot CMOS. I believe this doesn't happen anymore after BIOS update but its hard to tell. CPU and GPU temp always remain within normal temperatures as well.\n\nIs there any good way to figure out exactly whats wrong in this case? I mainly want to know if this is something that I can figure out or if I should give it to someone to diagnose and repair. This is my first PC.\n\nI understand it could be a settings error, or faulty RAM/MB/CPU still and I am happy to replace what I need if its physical. I JUST NEED TO KNOW.",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: Is it possible to put 8x RTX 5090 in a single 4U Rack? Does anyone have experiene with L4 and/or L40 cards?\n______________\n\nFirst of all: Sorry if this is against sub rules, but /r/buildaserver is completely dead, so I figured I might as well post here. So mods: Please feel free to remove if this content is not wanted.\n\n_______________\n\nThat being out of the way:  \nOur research group has a private compute cluster with 4x A100 GPUs, however, as we've gotten more people, this simply isn't enough anymore. I noticed however, that most of us don't even remotely make use of the 80GB VRAM these cards are capable of. Our workloads usually demand <20GB of VRAM, but could benefit greatly from more cards to run more simulations in parallel (parameter sweeps). That's why I have been pushing to buy many smaller cards for our next purchase instead of one or two big ones. And since it is my idea and also because I probably know hardware best out of our group, it has fallen to me to configure the thing. The thing is tho: Besides some LTT videos, I have zero experience with server hardware (and so does the rest of our group). So here are my **constraints**:\n\n- Has to be rack-mounted\n- Has to be air-cooled (it will be put into a big server room that has a nice cooling infrastructure)\n- approx. 40k€ budget (unfortunately we are not tax-exempt and have to pay 20% VAT, but this is not a hard limit - it just gets less likely it will get approved by our funders)\n\nSome additional information:\n\n- No software support needed (we have a software genius in our group that can handle setting up the server no problem)  \n- It'd be great if we got a completed system tho\n- Good warranty would be very nice also\n- We do **not** pay for electricity ourselves\n\nWith all that, I have basically got 3 options I think: \n\n- 8x RTX 5090\n- 8x L4\n- 4x L40S\n\nSo I would love to just put 8x RTX 5090 in the server and be done with it, but I haven't found any big server builders that build their systems with gaming GPUs and I am afraid if I buy from a no-name that the system will not function due to cooling issues. 8x 5090 at full tilt, two powerful CPUs and all the rest, we might be looking at 5000+ Watts, right? Are air-cooled 4U even prepared to handle that much heat?\n\nL4 and L40S are proper server GPUs, so we hopefully wouldn't have that issue, but the question is which one to take and I am tending towards the L4, since they are 3x as cheap as the L40S while being only 2x slower, and as I said, most of us don't use more than 20GB of VRAM anyway. But with the L4 we kind of \"waste\" that we do not need to pay for our electricity. But does anyone have experience with either of these cards? Because just from the specs it seems the gaming cards are a way better offer - if it weren't for the potential cooling issues...\n\n________________\n\nAnyway, long story short, this is the system I have currently configured with 8x L4s on supermicro that comes in just under 40k€ after VAT:\n\n| Component | Qty | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Chassis** | 1 | Supermicro AS-4125GS-TNRT 4U Rackmount H13 GPU SuperServer |\n| **CPU** | 2 | AMD EPYC™ Turin 9375F Processor 32-Core 3.85GHz 256MB Cache (320W) |\n| **Memory** | 12 | 32GB DDR5 6400MHz ECC RDIMM Server Memory (2Rx8) |\n| **M.2 SSD** | 1 | 480GB M.2 22x80 7450 PRO NVMe PCIe 4.0 3D TLC (1 x DWPD) |\n| **NVMe SSD** | 1 | 7.68TB 2.5\" CD8-P NVMe PCIe 5.0 Solid State Drive (1 x DWPD) |\n| **GPU** | 8 | NVIDIA® Ada L4 24GB GDDR6 PCIe 4.0 Graphics Card (70W) |\n\nAnd then we'll also throw in 2x 20TB HDDs ourselves in the 2 front bays, since you cant configure HDDs on supermicro for some reason (or more likely: ask them to do it for us). I figured one small M.2 SSD for boot and then a bigger one for fast storage is also good.\n\nWhat do you think? Are the CPUs enough to feed all 8 GPUs?  \nIf we can get another 10k€ (so 50k€ total after VAT) I'd really like to future proof a bit and get some Turin 9575F 64-cores instead and upgrade from 384GB RAM to 768GB. Because, while we don't do a lot on CPU, some of us will inevitably want to use this server as a CPU server also and this'd be a rather \"cheap\" upgrade for more than 2x the performance",

Straight Power 11 Modular 80+ Gold\n* **Case:** be quiet! Dark Base 700\n* **Cooling:** Corsair Hydro Series H100i Platinum + be quiet! Silent Wings 3 PWM\n\nI believe that my cooling setup is pretty solid, so it should have enough headroom for new hardware?\n\nThe first thing I already did: I replaced my 34-inch 60 Hz LG monitor with a 32-inch HP 165 Hz gaming monitor. Now my average FPS hurts even more - ouch! 😅  \nI did that to lower the resolution load on my system (and because the monitor itself is just way better overall).\n\nI’ve run a bunch of in-game benchmarks and attached some screenshots. To me, they don’t paint a clear picture of what the actual bottleneck is — but from what I’ve read on Reddit, it’s mainly the CPU, closely followed by the GPU. Basically, both are struggling.\n\nI've uploaded them here: [https://imgur.com/a/bwKQrOV](https://imgur.com/a/bwKQrOV)\n\nI’d love to get your opinion on the screenshots, maybe you can interpret them better than I can and give me some advice on good *budget* upgrade components.  \nUnfortunately, I have no idea whether a new GPU would fit in my case, if my PSU would be enough, or if my mainboard would still be compatible, and so on.\n\nI’m thinking about upgrading the CPU to something like a *Ryzen 7 5800XT or 5800X (Cost around 150 and 160 €)*, and the GPU to something from AMD or Nvidia for like 350 €.\n\n***Does an upgrade of like 500 € help me in my use-case for Battlefield 6 and upcoming games like GTA?***\n\nI’m from Germany, so prices here might differ from other regions.\n\n**Thanks a lot!**",

Thankfully it was off at the time.\n\nI have been trying to fix it, and I am pretty sure that the mobo is still good, but now it is bootlooping. So far I have:\n\n* Removed power supply (not going to re use for obvious reasons)\n* Removed GPU which took the brunt of the water\n* Removed everything from the motherboard but didn't unplug cpu, figured that if water was in there the whole thing was done anyway.\n* Removed water and dried using hairdryer\n\nThen I started replacing with spare parts. I don't care about retaining graphics or performance, files and use of a computer is more important.\n\n* Replaced PSU with old 450W (never had problems with it in the past but it is a low quality Corsair bronze from ages ago)\n* Replaced GPU with spare 1060 (this is the setup I used to run before)\n\nReconnecting everything outside the case, the computer came back to life!! files were there and everything was fine.\n\n* I then put the CPU cooler back on (with new paste) which was the most damp as dust inside it had absorbed water.\n* re-attached all the PSU cables back in the case\n\nThen, I turned it on forgetting to connect the GPU power supply, but it gave an error message saying to power down and attach the 6 pin pice. \n\nI reconnected the pcie, and the computer turned on. It then was acting strange; certain usb ports were not working, I had to switch things around for the keyboard and mouse to work. If I had the mouse in USB-1 and plugged something in to USB-2, the mouse would stop working. This is the moment I got very worried as turning the PC then suddenly turned off, and turning it on again would cause it to turn off shortly after. Since then I have tried:\n\n* Re-seating ram\n* Changing CMOS battery\n* Running with only one ram stick\n* unplugging and re-plugging power connectors\n* unplugging all drives except for the boot drive\n\nUnfortunately none of it had any effect and the PC still turns on only momentarily. I am about to strip it down and re-build it outside of the case so any suggestions would be great. Thank you.\n\nP.s. if I got a new PC entirely, would my hard drive files be safe?

    "selftext": "My friend made me a question the other day \"which is better 4060 ti 8gb or 9060 xt 8gb?\" I instantly said neither, 8gb of vram is enough and surely there is something better in the used market for that price. But the more I thought about it the less true that became.\n\nIt is true that newer and non optimized titles need more than 8gb, but is there really anything that is equal or better in that 9060 xt 8gb price range? You can find the powercolor model for 270 in amazon. Excluding games that need more than 8gb, it destroys anything else in price to performance. I cant even find an equivalent in the used market for that price.\n\nIf it later in its life drops to around 250, wouldnt it just be the defacto card, the 16gb version is significantly more expensive at 350 USD.\n\nSo, im asking, is it actually that bad? And what price do you think it needs to be to be good?\n\n  \n  \nSome extra stuff. Im thinking of upgrading at some point in the next year and so it my friend, so we are looking for gpus. We have massive import taxes on items over 200. Anything over 200 has a 20% tax added so a 250 USD card becomes a 300 USD so the lower the better. If you have any recommendations for what cards are good right now, new or used im all ears.",

I have analysis paralysis from all the research and I'm hesitant to pull the trigger for fear of messing up and getting a bad monitor.\n\nHere are my system specs:\n\n* Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700K CPU @ 3.80GHz, 3792 Mhz, 8 Core(s)\n* Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n* Monitors: (2) Asus VG278 & 1 Asus VE278\n* KVM Switch to move between work & home use\n* Xbox Series X tied into 1 of the 3 monitors\n* Lenovo ThinkPad T490 (for Work, will be switched to Dell Latitude 5450)\n\nI currently have flat monitors, but the curved ones are very attractive and seem like they'd be a good fit for my desk and all around. I currently have all 3 arranged in a line but can easily re-arrange to put 1 long monitor on the bottom and two additional ones on top of that.\n\nMy budget is $500 - $700 total.\n\nThe monitors that stand out so far are:\n\n* Asus VG27WQ3B\n* AOC C27G4H2 \n* Sceptre C275B Series\n* Dell G2524H\n* AOC Q27g3xMN\n\nMy main concern is to get something that will last a while, at least through my next PC upgrade and that I can see the text clearly. I have over the counter readers now because my monitors are not easy to read when working in excel for long hours.\n\nWhat would you recommend that I purchase?",

I have been troubleshooting ever since and cannot find the culprit. I just want to find out whats crashing so I can replace hardware, or fix settings so I can use the pc again.\n\nSome more info about when it crashes: I noticed the crashes happened after about 10-30 minutes of gaming, sometimes it would freeze up, sometimes it would just shut down, and sometimes it will BSOD. If I find the error in event viewer it always says a kernel-power with an event ID of 41. Sometimes if it BSODs It will show a stop code of \"IRQL not less or equal\" and sometimes I think it would say something related to a memory error. I started running stress testers and my gpu will run fine for a while using Furmark, but if I run its CPU stress test, the pc crashes after a couple minutes. I tested my RAM using memtest86 and they passed all 4 tests. I downloaded Windows XTU and it again crashes after a couple minutes when running its CPU stress test. I am happy to provide any file logs if needed. I downloaded the most recent BIOS update for my MB and have reset to defaults as well, still crashing. I have the intel CPU driver and NVIDIA gpu driver installed. Sometimes after crashes it won't turn back on unless I physically reset the boot CMOS. I believe this doesn't happen anymore after BIOS update but its hard to tell. CPU and GPU temp always remain within normal temperatures as well.\n\nIs there any good way to figure out exactly whats wrong in this case? I mainly want to know if this is something that I can figure out or if I should give it to someone to diagnose and repair. This is my first PC.\n\nI understand it could be a settings error, or faulty RAM/MB/CPU still and I am happy to replace what I need if its physical. I JUST NEED TO KNOW.",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: Is it possible to put 8x RTX 5090 in a single 4U Rack? Does anyone have experiene with L4 and/or L40 cards?\n______________\n\nFirst of all: Sorry if this is against sub rules, but /r/buildaserver is completely dead, so I figured I might as well post here. So mods: Please feel free to remove if this content is not wanted.\n\n_______________\n\nThat being out of the way:  \nOur research group has a private compute cluster with 4x A100 GPUs, however, as we've gotten more people, this simply isn't enough anymore. I noticed however, that most of us don't even remotely make use of the 80GB VRAM these cards are capable of. Our workloads usually demand <20GB of VRAM, but could benefit greatly from more cards to run more simulations in parallel (parameter sweeps). That's why I have been pushing to buy many smaller cards for our next purchase instead of one or two big ones. And since it is my idea and also because I probably know hardware best out of our group, it has fallen to me to configure the thing. The thing is tho: Besides some LTT videos, I have zero experience with server hardware (and so does the rest of our group). So here are my **constraints**:\n\n- Has to be rack-mounted\n- Has to be air-cooled (it will be put into a big server room that has a nice cooling infrastructure)\n- approx. 40k€ budget (unfortunately we are not tax-exempt and have to pay 20% VAT, but this is not a hard limit - it just gets less likely it will get approved by our funders)\n\nSome additional information:\n\n- No software support needed (we have a software genius in our group that can handle setting up the server no problem)  \n- It'd be great if we got a completed system tho\n- Good warranty would be very nice also\n- We do **not** pay for electricity ourselves\n\nWith all that, I have basically got 3 options I think: \n\n- 8x RTX 5090\n- 8x L4\n- 4x L40S\n\nSo I would love to just put 8x RTX 5090 in the server and be done with it, but I haven't found any big server builders that build their systems with gaming GPUs and I am afraid if I buy from a no-name that the system will not function due to cooling issues. 8x 5090 at full tilt, two powerful CPUs and all the rest, we might be looking at 5000+ Watts, right? Are air-cooled 4U even prepared to handle that much heat?\n\nL4 and L40S are proper server GPUs, so we hopefully wouldn't have that issue, but the question is which one to take and I am tending towards the L4, since they are 3x as cheap as the L40S while being only 2x slower, and as I said, most of us don't use more than 20GB of VRAM anyway. But with the L4 we kind of \"waste\" that we do not need to pay for our electricity. But does anyone have experience with either of these cards? Because just from the specs it seems the gaming cards are a way better offer - if it weren't for the potential cooling issues...\n\n________________\n\nAnyway, long story short, this is the system I have currently configured with 8x L4s on supermicro that comes in just under 40k€ after VAT:\n\n| Component | Qty | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Chassis** | 1 | Supermicro AS-4125GS-TNRT 4U Rackmount H13 GPU SuperServer |\n| **CPU** | 2 | AMD EPYC™ Turin 9375F Processor 32-Core 3.85GHz 256MB Cache (320W) |\n| **Memory** | 12 | 32GB DDR5 6400MHz ECC RDIMM Server Memory (2Rx8) |\n| **M.2 SSD** | 1 | 480GB M.2 22x80 7450 PRO NVMe PCIe 4.0 3D TLC (1 x DWPD) |\n| **NVMe SSD** | 1 | 7.68TB 2.5\" CD8-P NVMe PCIe 5.0 Solid State Drive (1 x DWPD) |\n| **GPU** | 8 | NVIDIA® Ada L4 24GB GDDR6 PCIe 4.0 Graphics Card (70W) |\n\nAnd then we'll also throw in 2x 20TB HDDs ourselves in the 2 front bays, since you cant configure HDDs on supermicro for some reason (or more likely: ask them to do it for us). I figured one small M.2 SSD for boot and then a bigger one for fast storage is also good.\n\nWhat do you think? Are the CPUs enough to feed all 8 GPUs?  \nIf we can get another 10k€ (so 50k€ total after VAT) I'd really like to future proof a bit and get some Turin 9575F 64-cores instead and upgrade from 384GB RAM to 768GB. Because, while we don't do a lot on CPU, some of us will inevitably want to use this server as a CPU server also and this'd be a rather \"cheap\" upgrade for more than 2x the performance",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

It’s pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound’s coming from. I don’t see any technical reason why we can’t have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nRaivk here, one of the two people working on ULTRA VERTIGO. We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

    "selftext": "**Hey, r/pcgaming!**\n\n**I’m Louis Denizet, game director at** [Hibernian Workshop](https://hibernian-workshop.com/)**, the indie studio behind the roguelite** [Astral Ascent](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280930/Astral_Ascent/) **— and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have!**\n\nI started the studio years ago after meeting Alexandre Magnat online — we were both self-taught and completely obsessed with pixel art, especially the kind you see in anime across different eras and styles. \n\nWhat followed after a few years since this match was Astral Ascent, a colorful, fast-paced roguelite in the vein of Dead Cells with a focus on fluid combat, replayability (with 5 unique characters to choose from), and wrapped up in a pixel art style that’s by now become a signature of our work. \n\nIt wasn’t our first game, but it’s the one where we finally found our footing. A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I’d describe the thematic heart of AA and we’ve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It’s also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we’re still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe’ve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We’ve learned a lot from our past games — Astral Ascent most of all — and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project… which, truth be told, probably won’t be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that’s the short of it about us.\n\nIt’s been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that’s to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We’re excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

    "title": "toggleHDR util for Windows",
    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

It’s pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound’s coming from. I don’t see any technical reason why we can’t have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nWe are currently in the process of designing our future house that we'll have built. \n\nThe main design is more or less finished, waiting on some financial and other details before kicking off the project for real.\n\nWhat we've wanted with my wife is to get a dedicated \"server room\" dedicated to storing all the household PCs, a NAS, an UPS etc... basically all the IT shit. And then have \"terminals\" around the house that consist of screens, HID, sound. The idea is to isolate all the annoying GPU noise, heat, dust etc in a single place in the house and be able to work and game in peace, quiet and comfort. Also have our TV/Video Projector connected to the system too, for netflix and chill. The basic idea was inspired by an old-ish LTT video.\n\nWe've planned to request the house be built with as many cable ducts/conduits built in the walls/floors, to allow for simple and efficient management of cables running around, without having to drill holes etc.\n\n  \nNow, the main question that we face today is - what exactly can be used to achieve the desired result? In the LTT video, Linus uses fiberoptic cables and it works fine, but it's way too expensive to do that for us, we are just engineers, not youtubers. We've considered running CAT6 cables and sending all through them, but i am not sure it'll work with our needs (at least 120hz, 2k for gaming, 4k 60hz, 5.1 sound for the TV...).\n\n  \nSo, i am looking for suggestions on general solutions, cables, KVMs and hubs etc that would work.\n\nHere's the details of what we want to achieve:\n\n* Kid's terminal 1 - 1 or 2 2k/120hz screens, HID, Sound\n* Kid's terminal 2 - 1 or 2 2k/120hz screens, HID, Sound\n* Parent work/gaming terminal 2 - 2 2k/120hz (or better) screens, HID, Sound\n* Parent work/gaming terminal 2 - 2 2k/120hz (or better) screens, HID, Sound\n* TV or Video Projector, connected through a 5.1 proper A/V amp\n\nThe distances are not big, the house will be \\~130m2 in total and a single floor.",

I swapped the GPU with the 9060xt and issues went away immediately with no issues until right now.  I do have another GPU to test with, just looking for some good input on how I should troubleshoot first. \n\nAlso, one thing I noticed on all of my GPU's is that I have to manually go into the AMD software and turn on fan tuning and shut off zero rpm or the GPU fans will not turn on.  This is something I need to do every AMD update.\n\n  \n",

And I'm about to buy two M.2 SSDs, suspecting the SATA SSD I have is old.  \nThe symptoms are:  \n\\- The BIOS detects the peripherals several times before booting into Windows (the keyboard and mouse turn on and off), making me think it's not finding the boot option on the disk.  \n\\- When Windows boots, it takes 5 to 10 minutes to be fully usable, and once it does, it's lightning fast! I read that changing the SATA SSD to an NVME M.2 SSD might fix it.  \n  \nBut I'm a little afraid it's the motherboard, and I bought my SSDs for nothing. What can I do to check definitively before spending money?\n\n**SPANISH:**\n\nHola, mi w11 tarda mucho en arrancar. Y estoy a punto de comprar 2 discos m.2 ssd, sospechando que el ssd sata que tengo ya está viejo. \n\nLos sintomas son: \n\n\\-La BIOS detecta los perifericos varias veces antes de dar con el arranque de windows (el teclado y el mouse encienden y apagan) y me hace pensar que no está encotrando el arranque en el disco.\n\n\\-Cuando windows arranca, demora enter 5 y 10 mins en quedar totalmente utilizable, y una vez lo logra, es un misil de rapido!. Leí que cambiando el ssd sata a un nmve m.2 podría solucionar.\n\nPero tengo cierto temor de que sea la placa, y compre mis ssds para nada. Qué puedo hacer para chequear definitivamente antes de desembolsar?",

How can I confirm if the 3070 Ti is actually dead vs just not initializing?\n\n\n2. Any known issues between B450M S2H and RTX 3070 Ti?\n\n\n3. Can this be a BIOS or PCIe Gen4 handshake issue? (should I force PCIe Gen3?)\n\n\n4. If the GPU is dead, what’s the best way to diagnose or repair it in India (Asus TUF variant)?\n\nAny help, advice, or similar experiences would be appreciated 🙏\nThanks in advance!",

    "title": "Thought on first build? - Ryzen 7 9700X & Radeon 9070XT",
    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nThis is my first time building myself a PC. I'm preparing this build and eagerly waiting for the BF offers.  \nI've never been able to play new games in good conditions so I thought it was time to change that, and learn to build a PC on my own. I want to have a good rig now, and upgrade it along the years.\n\nMy budget is EUR 1,500 max.  \nI live in Belgium but can buy from other EU countries - np. I prefer higher price for reliable components, rather than cheaper for lower reliability or unknown reliability.  \nI don't need a new monitor. I have a 1080p one rn and will upgrade to an IPS QHD one later. So the build is designed taking this into account.\n\nI already bought the SSD and the RAM sticks before the prices started to increase too much.  \nIn some cases, I have enforced the price for a component. That price is then the lowest I've recently seen - to keep in mind for Black Friday deals.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* What do you think of the build? Is it solid or has it flaws ?\n* Is the PSU enough for the build (9070XT more specifically), or would a 750W PSU be OK ?\n* Is the B850 mobo really needed? Or is a B650 (E?) enough? I see contradictory information on that\n* For the 9070XT, I mostly see Saphire and XFX at lower prices > are these reliable brands? Or should I prefer Gigabyte or Asrock, for example?\n* Do I need to buy separately thermal paste?\n* Do I need to buy a GPU bracket/support/holder?\n* Do I need anything else that won't be provided with any of the components yet?\n\nLet me know your thoughts!  \nTYVM! 🙏\n\n\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/list/kjwvXR)\n\n|Type|Item|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 7 9700X 3.8 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/YMzXsY/amd-ryzen-7-9700x-38-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100001404wof)|€208.00|\n|**CPU Cooler**|[ARCTIC Freezer 36 CPU Cooler](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/N6bRsY/arctic-freezer-36-cpu-cooler-acfre00123a)|€37.95 @ Bytes At Work|\n|**Motherboard**|[MSI PRO B850-S WIFI6E ATX AM5 Motherboard](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/GP7MnQ/msi-pro-b850-s-wifi6e-atx-am5-motherboard-pro-b850-s-wifi6e)|€156.00|\n|**Memory**|[Kingston FURY Beast 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/q7LdnQ/kingston-fury-beast-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-kf560c30bbek2-32)|Purchased For €112.50|\n|**Storage**|[Samsung 990 EVO Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 5.0 X2 NVME Solid State Drive](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/hpqrxr/samsung-990-evo-plus-2-tb-m2-2280-pcie-50-x2-nvme-solid-state-drive-mz-v9s2t0bw)|Purchased For €109.00|\n|**Video Card**|[XFX Swift Radeon RX 9070 XT 16 GB Video Card](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/T7RnTW/xfx-swift-radeon-rx-9070-xt-16-gb-video-card-rx-97tswf3b9)|€644.00|\n|**Case**|[MSI MAG FORGE 320R AIRFLOW ATX Mid Tower Case](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/brP8TW/msi-mag-forge-320r-airflow-atx-mid-tower-case-mag-forge-320r-airflow)|€69.98 @ Amazon Belgium|\n|**Power Supply**|[MSI MAG A850GL PCIE5 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/zF4Zxr/msi-mag-a850gl-pcie5-850-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-mag-a850gl-pcie5)|€104.21 @ Amazon Belgium|\n|*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts*|||\n|**Total**|**€1441.64**||\n|Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-10-21 14:44 CEST+0200|||",

I recently started playing RDR2 and the trees look like 2D paper cutouts from a 2005 game. That made me spend two hours researching TAA, FXAA, MSAA, FSR2, sharpening, and all that complicated stuff.\n\nNow while checking my NVIDIA Control Panel I noticed image sharpening is off. What’s the best value for clarity? Many recommend 25% but others say 50%. And what is “Ignore Film Grain”  also might the fact that image sharpening was turned off be the cause of ugly trees issue in games I play ? \n\n",

    "selftext": "Good morning!\nI recently made the error of buying a micro ATX motherboard for an ATX case. I cannot return the motherboard, so my two options are to buy a new case or buy a new motherboard. Now, obviously the cheaper alternative would be to buy a new case, however, I want to keep the existing case I have because I am set on having a 360 mm AIO. I have included a picture of the micro ATX motherboard inside the case with the proposed graphics card. I want to know if it looks OK if it still looks a little too small, it will have that 360 mm AIO on the front of the CPU.\n\nNo problems with the IO shield, also unsure if the GPU should be in the top PCIE slot or it’s fine where it is now. Above all else I am set on having an all white bill, which is why I ignorantly went with this motherboard.\n\nObviously, the common issue with this is that an MATX motherboard typically looks too small in a full ATX case, but if it doesn’t look too bad, I’m willing to just keep the set up as is. Any thoughts?\n\nThanks!\n",

It’s weirdly emotional seeing it all together after building it piece by piece. I’ve been testing everything nonstop gaming, editing, stress tests and on the side. No frame drops, no coil whine, no regrets.  \nAnyone else take the slow route with their setup instead of going all in at once? It makes the final build feel way more personal.",

    "selftext": "Im building my new pc and with my budget the 5070 fits perfectly. My only concern is that the 12gb of vram could be a limitation in the future since I mainly want to use it for 1440p gaming. I've seen that the 9070xt is 100$ more which doesn't fit my budget as good as the 5070 does so I'd probably have to save a bit on the monitor, mouse and keyboard, or maybe change my cpu from the 9600x to the 7600 or the 7500f. So what should I do? Thanks in advance ",

    "selftext": "(Pictures attached below) Bought the MSI G274QPX less than 2 years ago, probably about 1 year and 6 months, and it had some weird stuff happen to it some times (Like the lower side of the screen looks torn and all you could see is static but after turning it on and off, it goes away. This also happens when you boot up the PC while it's loading, then you get to the log in screen and it's just gone like it never happened), to name a few. Yes, I do use the PC for work, Zoom meetings, playing games like Call of Duty Warzone, watching movies, YouTube etc.  and I believe it's still moderate use case, borderline heavy, probably averaging 10 hrs a day. \n\nDidn't pay attention to it then since it resolved itself, and that shouldn't really be an issue, since my older Xiaomi Mi Surface 34\", about 5 or 6 years old at this point, has had no issues aside from actual screen tearing from playing games. I predominantly do the gaming on the MSI monitor for higher frames and not much of the workload etc. (which can still be pretty high demand since I have a lot of Google Chrome tabs open.\n\nNow, my MSI monitor is having these intermittent lines pop up throughout the length of the whole monitor and it becomes very distracting when working, especially when watching stuff on the other monitor since you get to focus on the lines instead of the movie/anime or whatever it is. \n\nI've already tried turning the monitor on and off, turning the whole PC off, restarting, checking for AMD software updates (previously had a 3060Ti here not sure if this can cause an issue since even after uninstalling there seems to be some leftover Nvidia software on the PC), swapped DP cables, swapped where it's inserted in the GPU slots, I also tried it on HDMI (Issue is much worse there), tried connecting it to my Mac too still showing the issue. \n\nAlso, putting pressure on the bezel, makes the behavior of the intermittent lines more erratic no matter where I put pressure on it. Currently trying to see if it's still under warranty, store still hasn't gotten back to me.\n\nAny thoughts on what else I can do aside from taking it to a reputable store to have it repaired / buying a new one?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w681wi68xfwf1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c19d525220c76416a2ac1d9cb4e869b53fcbbdcf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1iqnf78xfwf1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51ea8cff9f1028a6a498eec7aba3afd077a29dd8\n\n",

All other cores are mostly idling. \n\nI have tried:\n\n* Obviously reinstalling the driver\n* Disabling fTPM\n* Disabling PCI Express Link Statement Management\n* Disabling XMP / Enabling XMP\n* Disabling Window real time protection\n\nI am at my wits ends - it's a damn fresh install with everything updated; I've had my GB AX370-Gaming 5 with this same proc, GPU and RAM for a couple of years and it ran flawlessly... so obviously this new board combo is breaking something. \n\nHalp?

Just now i thought about could it be that the other OS ssd has encryption on and thus it doesnt work in the \"new\" pc?\n\nBoard is a MSI B450 Gaming Plus. Both ssds are M.2 nvme ",

    "title": "Another 5090 down in flames",
    "selftext": "I had my MSI 5090 Suprim Liquid for five months without any issues until yesterday. Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA’s foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI’m totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card… \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I’m usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can’t believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately. I’m aware this is an MSI product, but Nvidia insist that every manufacturer uses this horrible connector.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI have reached out to MSI for a warranty claim, but they told me I need to get in touch with my local vendor Scan.\nScan initially accepted the request but wanted me to pay for shipping and insurance of that 8lb box on my own dime, as it is a \"damaged goods return\". And insuring such an expensive box turns out to be quite pricey.\n\nThis morning they suddenly changed their stance and a pre-paid courir will pick it up tomorrow.\nThis is likely due to this post, which I have mentioned in my correspondence with customer support. \n\nI can't thank you enough for all the upvotes and I'll keep you posted on this.\n\n \nRE choice of cable: Many of you have pointed out not to use the included MSI cable and instead the 12v6x2 from my Corsair PSU, which most PSUs won't even provide. When I built the PC I've watched this video https://youtu.be/6FJ_KSizDwM?si=MTw-3uioJ0wdiR_M&t=486 which strongly recommends not to use the Corsair PSU cable because of the bad quality and instead use the MSI cable which was praised for it's quality.\n\nDo with this information what you want, but it seems the current consensus is to use the PSU cable.",

I cannot return the motherboard, so my two options are to buy a new case or buy a new motherboard. Now, obviously the cheaper alternative would be to buy a new case, however, I want to keep the existing case I have because I am set on having a 360 mm AIO. I have included a picture of the micro ATX motherboard inside the case with the proposed graphics card. I want to know if it looks OK if it still looks a little too small, it will have that 360 mm AIO on the front of the CPU.\n\nNo problems with the IO shield, also unsure if the GPU should be in the top PCIE slot or it’s fine where it is now. Above all else I am set on having an all white bill, which is why I ignorantly went with this motherboard.\n\nObviously, the common issue with this is that an MATX motherboard typically looks too small in a full ATX case, but if it doesn’t look too bad, I’m willing to just keep the set up as is. Any thoughts?\n\nThanks!\n",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nThis is my first time building myself a PC. I'm preparing this build and eagerly waiting for the BF offers.  \nI've never been able to play new games in good conditions so I thought it was time to change that, and learn to build a PC on my own. I want to have a good rig now, and upgrade it along the years.\n\nMy budget is EUR 1,500 max.  \nI live in Belgium but can buy from other EU countries - np. I prefer higher price for reliable components, rather than cheaper for lower reliability or unknown reliability.  \nI don't need a new monitor. I have a 1080p one rn and will upgrade to an IPS QHD one later. So the build is designed taking this into account.\n\nI already bought the SSD and the RAM sticks before the prices started to increase too much.  \nIn some cases, I have enforced the price for a component. That price is then the lowest I've recently seen - to keep in mind for Black Friday deals.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* What do you think of the build? Is it solid or has it flaws ?\n* Is the PSU enough for the build (9070XT more specifically), or would a 750W PSU be OK ?\n* Is the B850 mobo really needed? Or is a B650 (E?) enough? I see contradictory information on that\n* For the 9070XT, I mostly see Saphire and XFX at lower prices > are these reliable brands? Or should I prefer Gigabyte or Asrock, for example?\n* Do I need to buy separately thermal paste?\n* Do I need to buy a GPU bracket/support/holder?\n* Do I need anything else that won't be provided with any of the components yet?\n\nLet me know your thoughts!  \nTYVM! 🙏\n\n\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/list/kjwvXR)\n\n|Type|Item|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 7 9700X 3.8 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/YMzXsY/amd-ryzen-7-9700x-38-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100001404wof)|€208.00|\n|**CPU Cooler**|[ARCTIC Freezer 36 CPU Cooler](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/N6bRsY/arctic-freezer-36-cpu-cooler-acfre00123a)|€37.95 @ Bytes At Work|\n|**Motherboard**|[MSI PRO B850-S WIFI6E ATX AM5 Motherboard](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/GP7MnQ/msi-pro-b850-s-wifi6e-atx-am5-motherboard-pro-b850-s-wifi6e)|€156.00|\n|**Memory**|[Kingston FURY Beast 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/q7LdnQ/kingston-fury-beast-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-kf560c30bbek2-32)|Purchased For €112.50|\n|**Storage**|[Samsung 990 EVO Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 5.0 X2 NVME Solid State Drive](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/hpqrxr/samsung-990-evo-plus-2-tb-m2-2280-pcie-50-x2-nvme-solid-state-drive-mz-v9s2t0bw)|Purchased For €109.00|\n|**Video Card**|[XFX Swift Radeon RX 9070 XT 16 GB Video Card](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/T7RnTW/xfx-swift-radeon-rx-9070-xt-16-gb-video-card-rx-97tswf3b9)|€644.00|\n|**Case**|[MSI MAG FORGE 320R AIRFLOW ATX Mid Tower Case](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/brP8TW/msi-mag-forge-320r-airflow-atx-mid-tower-case-mag-forge-320r-airflow)|€69.98 @ Amazon Belgium|\n|**Power Supply**|[MSI MAG A850GL PCIE5 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/zF4Zxr/msi-mag-a850gl-pcie5-850-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-mag-a850gl-pcie5)|€104.21 @ Amazon Belgium|\n|*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts*|||\n|**Total**|**€1441.64**||\n|Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-10-21 14:44 CEST+0200|||",

    "selftext": "I had my MSI 5090 Suprim Liquid for five months without any issues until yesterday. Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA’s foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI’m totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card… \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I’m usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can’t believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately. I’m aware this is an MSI product, but Nvidia insist that every manufacturer uses this horrible connector.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI have reached out to MSI for a warranty claim, but they told me I need to get in touch with my local vendor Scan.\nScan initially accepted the request but wanted me to pay for shipping and insurance of that 8lb box on my own dime, as it is a \"damaged goods return\". And insuring such an expensive box turns out to be quite pricey.\n\nThis morning they suddenly changed their stance and a pre-paid courir will pick it up tomorrow.\nThis is likely due to this post, which I have mentioned in my correspondence with customer support. \n\nI can't thank you enough for all the upvotes and I'll keep you posted on this.\n\n \nRE choice of cable: Many of you have pointed out not to use the included MSI cable and instead the 12v6x2 from my Corsair PSU, which most PSUs won't even provide. When I built the PC I've watched this video https://youtu.be/6FJ_KSizDwM?si=MTw-3uioJ0wdiR_M&t=486 which strongly recommends not to use the Corsair PSU cable because of the bad quality and instead use the MSI cable which was praised for it's quality.\n\nDo with this information what you want, but it seems the current consensus is to use the PSU cable.",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

I was able to make the MagSafe mount for $8 and the monitor riser I made myself by using the same dimensions from various manufacturers. \n\nRocking a 34” LG ultra-wide and man I love it. Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

    "selftext": "**Please ignore the cables and mess, that is currently in progress to be fixed.**  \n  \nI’m trying to add a 4th display under my main monitor. All three of my current monitors are wall-mounted, so there’s about an 8.5-inch vertical gap between the desk and the bottom edge of the middle screen. I’d like to fill that space with a small monitor that can tilt upward toward me, something around 15 inches smaller or larger is fine if it fits nicely.\n\nI work two remote jobs. My main desktop runs my primary job, and my company laptop handles a second, lighter role where I mostly respond to messages and manage a small team. Both setups really benefit from having two screens. I plan to use a KVM switch to share my keyboard/mouse and possibly one or two monitors between the systems, but I’d like a dedicated screen underneath the middle monitor for quick multitasking.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Fits within an 8.5-inch gap under my center monitor\n* Can tilt upward (20–35° ideally)\n* Doesn’t need to be fancy — 1080p is fine\n* Ideally plug-and-play (HDMI or USB-C)\n* Clean look that blends well with my setup\n\nI’ve looked into stretch bar displays, which would look amazing, but most are expensive or complicated to set up. So I’m leaning toward a portable monitor as a practical option for now. I just want to see if anyone has found a budget-friendly tilted display that fits under a main monitor like this.",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Finally got my setup to a place I’m happy with, so figured I’d share. My old chair’s recline mechanism broke and it was basically stuck in full chill mode 24/7. It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

I know Glorious gets a lot of hate, but I still enjoy the board even with the known issues. \n\nI enjoy playing around with these boards because of the ability to customize them. I have many other keyboards with about as much customizability, but they don’t have a matching numpad for me to play with. I finally decided to get the brass plates and do a black and gold build for my cheap keyboard.\n\nKeyboard(s): Glorious GMMK 3 Pro Barebones (Wired Only) and GMMK Numpad \n\nI have 3 plates for these, for this set up it has the Brass Plate. I also swapped out the knobs, the badge on the keyboard and the badge on the numpad for gold options. Loving the brass plate in this build.\n\nSwitches: Neo X Keygeek Oat\n\nKeycaps: GMK Black & Gold ",

    "selftext": "My experiences:\n\n**Corsair K95 (gone)**\n\nThe prints on that are laser imprinted and quickly faded. it became glossy and looked dirty after some use. It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper.\n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone as some reccomended it to me but GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust AI 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at an odd location. \n\nWhat other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI have posted this to Geek Hack also, but it's been over a week and my post has not been approved. I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

    "selftext": "I have built/modded several premium boards, but regardless of that fact,  I picked up a used Ducky One Mini. I had seen a video by Alex Otos, praising his 60% Ducky budget keyboard. He said it was his go-to for gaming. Therefore I decided to pick one up and guess what? I love it. I can’t really explain it, but it just feels good to type on. It has a quiet sound profile (which I typically hate), and has a pretty minimalist vibe to it.\n\nWhen I first bought it (used off of eBay), I immediately regretted it because I felt I overpaid for it after I foolishly looked around and found some for half the price. As soon as I got it, I tried to swap out keycaps and those freakin’ inductive switches came out with every single keycap! I soon realized the used budget keycap set I had grabbed (off of eBay, as well) were way too tight. I had to fight every single switch to get it out of the keycap I had pulled off (when I decided I didn’t like them and chose to go back to the original keycaps). They were so hard to detach from the keycaps, my hands were killing me. I finally resorted to a rubber jar gripper that made the job a little easier as I got down to the last few keycaps.\n\nThe inductive switches came out crazy easy and I was not happy about that. However, when I got it back together again and just chose a few colorful keycaps for some modifier keys, I liked the simple look of it (and I will never again swap out the keycaps!) My hands literally ached the entire next day. \n\nHowever, after using it for a few days, I was hooked!  You have got feel it to understand it.\n\nLayout: 60%\nConnectivity: Tri-mode\nCase: ABS\nMount Style: Gasket-mount\nPlate material: SPCC Steel\nSwitches: Ducky Inductive Switches-linear, 3.5 mm total travel, 40g initial force\nDampening Design: Ducky QUACK Mechanics+ with 7-layer dampening\nKeycaps: Ducky 85% high-purity PBT Double-shot PBT\nStabalizers: Ducky Plate-Mounted\nHot-Swappable: Yes\nReport Rate: 1000 Hz\nSoftware: Web-based \nModifier Keycaps - Double-shot PBT (Ali Express)\n\n",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

Something with 165hz or more, a decent HDR for the PS5 and obviously an HDMI 2.1 for VRR. I'm actually having a hard time trying to find something that has some reviews. \n\nI've actually found the new Lenovo Legion 27Q-10, but has zero reviews, because it's pretty new. The other option is the Lenovo Legion R27qe, but some say it has orribile HDR. \n\nSo, i hope you could help me, and sorry for any mistake as English is not my first language!",

    "selftext": "I run 1x 32\" 4K and 2x27\" 1440p monitors. I ideally want 115% for the 4k and 100% for the 1440p monitors, but custom scaling is applied to all monitors. 125% takes away too much real-estate on the 4K, but as a compromise I could live with it if it wasn't for the fact that some apps (mostly office applications) become really blurry on the 1440p monitors, which is a problem when I for example use outlook on one of them to keep track of my emails. Because the blur on my two 1440p monitors make them pretty much useless I just default to 100% on all three which causes eye strain when I use the main 4K monitor. \n\nSeriously, this has been an issue on windows for decades, and it's still a problem, and the fact that Office applications are the most affected by blur just further proves that Microsoft just can't handle scaling at all (don't get me started on the grandma-level \"recommended\" scaling factors...).   \nI currently run Win11. \n\nIs there any plugin or third party software that could fix the sclaing issues? When I search for solutions I couldn't find much at all. \n\n",

    "selftext": "MSI is committed to offering a wide variety of gaming monitors to meet the needs of all kinds of users.\n\nNow, we’re excited to introduce our latest Mini-LED monitors, specially designed for enthusiastic gamers. Powered by advanced Mini-LED technology, these monitors deliver vivid, high-contrast visuals, making them especially ideal for HDR content and immersive gaming experiences.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1jd5uocdwf1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37badcde8916b5a54460b9258f6571ba2dcf5c7\n\n**Mini-LED Backlight with 1152 Local Dimming Zones**\n\nAll three models are equipped with 1,152 full-array local dimming zones, deliver peak brightness of up to 1000 nits, and are VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified for a premium HDR experience with stunning clarity and contrast.\n\nCompared with conventional LCD monitors, the Mini-LED backlight technology provides a reduced halo effect, deeper blacks without being grayish, delivering precise light control and more lifelike, vivid visuals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvkqby5tcdwf1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a175ffc0d2ea17ad8c4faeeb8319e6711f5243\n\n**Quantum Dot Film for Superior Visuals**\n\nThe MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Rapid IPS panels, while the MAG 274QPF X30MV adopts a Rapid VA panel. All of them integrate Quantum Dot film to deliver an exceptional visual and gaming experience.\n\n\\- Rapid IPS / Rapid VA ensure ultra-fast response times, minimizing motion blur and delivering smooth gameplay.\n\n\\- Quantum Dot film expands the color gamut, producing richer, more vibrant colors for stunning image quality.\n\nTogether, they offer a perfect blend of speed, clarity, and color accuracy for both gamers and content creators.\n\n\n\n**Revolutionary Dual Mode for Ultimate Flexibility**\n\nBoth MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Dual Mode, supporting:\n\n·        4K@160Hz for ultra-sharp visuals.\n\n·        FHD@320Hz for ultra-smooth gameplay. \n\nTo make switching effortless, gamers can seamlessly move between AAA titles and competitive FPS games using MSI’s 5-way Navi Key, which allows them to toggle between two modes with a single click.\n\nMSI has also made Dual Mode smarter with AI Dual Mode. This feature detects resolution and refresh rate settings and automatically adjusts to the optimized refresh rate when switching. For example, if you set your monitor to 4K@120Hz, the FHD mode will automatically adjust to 240Hz instead of 320Hz, ensuring a balanced experience without extreme discrepancies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss8zsxuycdwf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3d7faf4171a7e6a1c0c02368dfb61ba6a323d5\n\nLearn more about Dual Mode and other AI features, please visit:\n\n[https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience](https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience)\n\n **Specification:**\n\n|Model|MPG 274URDFW E16M|MAG 274UPDF E16M|MAG 274QPF X30MV|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Size|27\"|27\"|27\"|\n|Resolution|UHD|UHD|WQHD|\n|Resfresh Rate|160Hz|160Hz|300Hz|\n|Dual Mode|FHD 320Hz|FHD 320Hz|N/A|\n|Panel|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid VA with Mini-LED|\n|Local Dimming|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|\n|Quantum Dot|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Brightness (nits)|SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |\n|HDR|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|\n|Response Time|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|\n|Connectivity|1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/98W PD, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x USB 2.0 Type-B |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/15W PD |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (WQHD@300Hz)|\n|Gaming Intelligence App|Support|N/A|N/A|\n|Firmware Update|Support|Support|Support|\n\nFor more information please visit the product pages.\n\nMPG 274URDFW E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274UPDF E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274QPF X30MV: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/)\n\n  \nRelease Date:\n\nThey are now available on the market in US.",

It's been completely adequate for how I use it. I just started getting back into playing PS5 and decided that I want something a little bigger (vertically) than what my ultrawide offers.\n\nI'v narrowed my search down to two monitors:\n\n1) Dell S3225QS (4K 120Hz VA)\n\n2) Samsung LS32DG502ENXZA (QHD 180Hz IPS)\n\nFor the life of me, I cannot decide which is the better option. I use my monitor primarily for productivity but also plan to start using it more for gaming. I like the idea of 4k, but I also like the idea of IPS. These are both \\~$300, which is really the most I want to spend for an upgrade. Regardless, both monitors would be a nice quality upgrade from what I have. For productivity, I work with a lot of documents, and, for PS5, I primarily play slower single player games (Lego games mostly but also enjoy Horizon and would like to eventually play Hogwarts Legacy).\n\nI keep reading polarizing opinions on both sides: QHD vs 4K and IPS vs VA.\n\nWould love any feedback anybody has!

    "title": "Samsung Odyssey G5 \"off timer\" issue",
    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have this Samsung Odyssey G5 monitor (C34G55). \n\nI've had it already for maybe couple of years. However few days ago, I did some tweaks with contrast, brightness, sharpness settings by testing how it may improve image quality. After playing with those settigns for a bit the entire screen menu froze and didn't respond at all.\n\nSo, I decided to unplug and plug it back. And that did solve that particular frozen menu issue.\n\nHowever, shortly afterwards I've started to have issues with off timer setting. I made some investigation before writing in here and it appears that for some reason, now the screen seems to ignore if I set off timer to \"off\". And instead, it just picks the off timer's hours values no matter if off timer itself is off or on.\n\nFor example, if I set off timer to 1, and then afterwards set off timer to \"off\", screen will still enter a shutdown mode after 1h. Meaning I have to manually turn it back on.\n\n- I've tried to do factory reset.\n- I double checked that both \"off timer plus\" and \"eco timer\" are set to off. \n- I also did reset with unplug/plug and pressing power button 30sec. \n- I did firmware update through usb.\n\nAnd while I suspect the thing with frozen menu might have somehow affected my current issue, I still have had few rare occasions even before, where I experienced similar but not as \"permanent\" issues. Like screen not turning on, where I had to replug and unplug screen to make it work again.\n\nIt's not a fatal issue, but pretty anoying as I'm used that it turns automatically on when I wake my PC. I can of course set that \"off timer\" to 23h, but it'll still turn off randomly after 23h. So I'm just wondering, if any of you have or had similar issues and if you have found any fixes for that?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers.\n\n\n",

This monitor, or the Acer variant, could be a candidate to be my next one, however I don't see a lot of reviews about its 2D capabilities. I currently own an Acer Predator X27bmiphzx monitor, which is an IPS monitor with local dimming and quantum dot technology. I really like its HDR capabilities and very bright and vivid colors, although the white halo around bright objects on a dark background and black uniformity are issues, including the very noisy fan, the noisiest component of my PC . I wonder if the 3D monitors can achieve similar HDR performance and color performance.\n\nAny experience or opinions would be very valuable.\n\nThanks...",

    "selftext": "The last time I bought a monitor was more than 12 years ago, so I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed and apprehensive by all the options currently at market. While my current monitor is functional, it's starting to show signs of needing a long overdue retirement, such as flashing the logo for a while until it warms up when turning on on cold weather.\n\nI'm looking for something that can handle video editing, but also gaming. Video editing is what I do for a living, so that means at least 8 hours of my day is spent with Premiere, After Effects and Word open. At night, I'm usually either gaming, practicing/studying motion design in After Effects or watching something. \n\nIn case it's relevant: I typically deliver my videos on Rec. 709. I play games like Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Stardew Valley, Subnautica, Frostpunk, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, and so on. I very rarely play multiplayer shooters. \n\nFrom my research, I'm under impression that OLED wouldn't be a good option for me, because of the amount of static stuff for a long period while I'm working, so I have focused on IPS panels, with maximum size of 27\", with minimum resolution at 1440p.\n\nI'm not in the US, neither EU, so while there are plenty of options, it isn't the same as US or EU options. Some of the monitors I can get through Amazon, though. Or even Aliexpress. \n\nSome options I considered, but not feeling confident in buying: BenQ EX271, Asus VG259Q5A or VG27AQ5A or VG249QML5A, AOC 27G4/P, Acer Nitro XV273K, MSI MAG 274URFW. \n\nAre they good options? Would you go for one of them or are there better options? Or would you recommend something else? ",

Work is a combination of coding, lots of database work, spreadsheets, email, etc.  The room has a lot of natural light during the day.  I really only play single player games and have never been bothered by the 165hz framerate.  My desktop PC has the following:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 7700x\n* RTX 4070 12 GB GPU\n* 32GB DDR5 memory.\n\nThe primary monitor (right in front of me) is a 27\" QHD Dell S2721DGF.  This is also the one that I use to occasionally play single player games.  My second monitor (to the right) is a 6+ year old Acer 24\" FHD 16:10 monitor.\n\nI wanted to upgrade the second monitor to a 27\" QHD or 4K display.  This leaves me with several options.\n\n1. Simply replace the 24\" FHD with a new 27\" QHD monitor (refresh/response rates wouldn't really matter).\n2. Get a new 27\" monitor and use the Dell as the secondary monitor.  If I go this route then that leads to several questions.\n   1. Should I replace it with a 2k (same resolution) or 4K monitor?  I'm a bit concerned that 27\" would be too small for 4k and that my setup wouldn't be adequate to play games on a 4k monitor\n   2. Should I consider mini-led given my usage?\n\nAny advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

IPS has none of the long term issues while costing way less, the only downside is the slightly worse picture quality and negligible extra 3ms response times. (You don't buy an OLED for competitive games don't lie, OLED blacks actually gives you a disadvantage in competitive games)\n\nThe reason why they charge so much for OLED is because of its popularity and audience not the hardware, OLED fans will defend OLED like their life depends on it and will even gaslight people into buying one. If you're not rich and don't have money to waste every 2-3 years just buy a good IPS monitor that will last you 10+ years.",

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G64",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. \n\nI come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). \n\nA few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for €170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for €199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. \n\nFirst, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. \n\nMy perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". \n\nWith those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). \n\nThe cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. \n\nIf I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! \n\nFor any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!\n\nHere is a link for the same images in decent quality: [https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C](https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C)",

    "selftext": "I just recently bought an Acer H236HL monitor, and it's been working well for about 2 months. However, just last night I was gaming on it and the monitor all of a sudden turned off but would still play sounds and such. I unplugged it and turned it back on, and the blue indicator light started blinking and the screen began to flicker on and off without truly turning on. Since then, I haven't been able to turn it off, and the only way to get it to turn off is by unplugging the power cord. Is there any way to fix this problem?",

Because the blur on my two 1440p monitors make them pretty much useless I just default to 100% on all three which causes eye strain when I use the main 4K monitor. \n\nSeriously, this has been an issue on windows for decades, and it's still a problem, and the fact that Office applications are the most affected by blur just further proves that Microsoft just can't handle scaling at all (don't get me started on the grandma-level \"recommended\" scaling factors...).   \nI currently run Win11. \n\nIs there any plugin or third party software that could fix the sclaing issues?

Also I can’t do ultra wides, I don’t have the desk space.",

For reference I mostly use it for productivity, movie watching and also some light gaming occassionally (casual online FPS games).  \n  \nI have a 32\" 4K at work that is great for productivity, but I went with the 1440p 27\" because I my PC isn't powerful enough to run games at 4k, but now realize FSR and integer scaling is supported by my GPU, so this would be less of a problem, right? \n\nSo does it make more sense to go with a 4K 32\"? Will the scaling be clearer/cleaner and have less potential issues with apps with the 4k over the 1440p? \n\nAm I missing anything? \n\nThank you!",

I also don’t trust all the marketing lingo reminds me of Alienware too much, and those are just expensive versions of other products. \n\nAnyone have any recommendations? Not sure if OLEDs are very fast just know they are very expensive. I have a budget around $500-$600USD. ",

Powered by advanced Mini-LED technology, these monitors deliver vivid, high-contrast visuals, making them especially ideal for HDR content and immersive gaming experiences.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1jd5uocdwf1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37badcde8916b5a54460b9258f6571ba2dcf5c7\n\n**Mini-LED Backlight with 1152 Local Dimming Zones**\n\nAll three models are equipped with 1,152 full-array local dimming zones, deliver peak brightness of up to 1000 nits, and are VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified for a premium HDR experience with stunning clarity and contrast.\n\nCompared with conventional LCD monitors, the Mini-LED backlight technology provides a reduced halo effect, deeper blacks without being grayish, delivering precise light control and more lifelike, vivid visuals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvkqby5tcdwf1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a175ffc0d2ea17ad8c4faeeb8319e6711f5243\n\n**Quantum Dot Film for Superior Visuals**\n\nThe MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Rapid IPS panels, while the MAG 274QPF X30MV adopts a Rapid VA panel. All of them integrate Quantum Dot film to deliver an exceptional visual and gaming experience.\n\n\\- Rapid IPS / Rapid VA ensure ultra-fast response times, minimizing motion blur and delivering smooth gameplay.\n\n\\- Quantum Dot film expands the color gamut, producing richer, more vibrant colors for stunning image quality.\n\nTogether, they offer a perfect blend of speed, clarity, and color accuracy for both gamers and content creators.\n\n\n\n**Revolutionary Dual Mode for Ultimate Flexibility**\n\nBoth MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Dual Mode, supporting:\n\n·        4K@160Hz for ultra-sharp visuals.\n\n·        FHD@320Hz for ultra-smooth gameplay. \n\nTo make switching effortless, gamers can seamlessly move between AAA titles and competitive FPS games using MSI’s 5-way Navi Key, which allows them to toggle between two modes with a single click.\n\nMSI has also made Dual Mode smarter with AI Dual Mode. This feature detects resolution and refresh rate settings and automatically adjusts to the optimized refresh rate when switching. For example, if you set your monitor to 4K@120Hz, the FHD mode will automatically adjust to 240Hz instead of 320Hz, ensuring a balanced experience without extreme discrepancies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss8zsxuycdwf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3d7faf4171a7e6a1c0c02368dfb61ba6a323d5\n\nLearn more about Dual Mode and other AI features, please visit:\n\n[https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience](https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience)\n\n **Specification:**\n\n|Model|MPG 274URDFW E16M|MAG 274UPDF E16M|MAG 274QPF X30MV|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Size|27\"|27\"|27\"|\n|Resolution|UHD|UHD|WQHD|\n|Resfresh Rate|160Hz|160Hz|300Hz|\n|Dual Mode|FHD 320Hz|FHD 320Hz|N/A|\n|Panel|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid VA with Mini-LED|\n|Local Dimming|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|\n|Quantum Dot|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Brightness (nits)|SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |\n|HDR|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|\n|Response Time|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|\n|Connectivity|1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/98W PD, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x USB 2.0 Type-B |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/15W PD |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (WQHD@300Hz)|\n|Gaming Intelligence App|Support|N/A|N/A|\n|Firmware Update|Support|Support|Support|\n\nFor more information please visit the product pages.\n\nMPG 274URDFW E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274UPDF E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274QPF X30MV: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/)\n\n  \nRelease Date:\n\nThey are now available on the market in US.",

Something with 165hz or more, a decent HDR for the PS5 and obviously an HDMI 2.1 for VRR. I'm actually having a hard time trying to find something that has some reviews. \n\nI've actually found the new Lenovo Legion 27Q-10, but has zero reviews, because it's pretty new. The other option is the Lenovo Legion R27qe, but some say it has orribile HDR. \n\nSo, i hope you could help me, and sorry for any mistake as English is not my first language!",

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G64",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. \n\nI come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). \n\nA few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for €170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for €199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. \n\nFirst, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. \n\nMy perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". \n\nWith those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). \n\nThe cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. \n\nIf I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! \n\nFor any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!\n\nHere is a link for the same images in decent quality: [https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C](https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C)",

Or do you think it's worth waiting until black friday( last year i waited and to be honest prices weren't as crazy as I thought they would be). I have a 1440p 144hz monitor at the minute but it's getting a little old at this point.

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "selftext": "After A/B testing both the AirPods Pros 3 and 2. I notice that my AirPods Pro 2 sound good for music listening on the go. When I am at my gaming PC, though, I use Moondrop x Crinacle DUSK DSP:Default or Moondrop S8, planning to buy the Meteor for music listening. I actually don't enjoy the Pros 3 for music listening. When I first tested these on a song Call me now by INNA and Michael Calfan, compared to my Pros 2, the punch of bass disappeared, and things sounded narrow like diffuse field-based tuning or Moondrop VSDF Tuning—also with the fact that her voice got really sharp.\n\nHowever, with the AirPods Pros 3, good Adaptive noise cancellation and the feature to turn off after you fall asleep, and 8 hours of battery life, along with its bass response and resonance peak. This may sound weird, but I have been listening to Sydney Sweeney jeans ads and a couple of whisper ASMR content. Pros 3 actually sounded excellent for this content, allowing me to listen to low volume with this content having that satisfying feeling that I can't describe. Like whisper sounded crisper and more delightful. I assume this is due to the \"vivid vocal clarity\" claim that Apple made. Can anyone relate?",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

Truly excellent. \n\nI have noticed some treble sharpness and sibilance on bright recordings such as choral pieces and flute passages (the high note in Miserere, flutes of Debussy Prelude a l’après midi d’un Faune). Even at moderate volume this was uncomfortable.\n\nIn general, the headphones are clearly at least one tier above the CB Sundaras. Better in every way.

    "selftext": "I'm potentially in the market for my first pair of earbuds and I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could help with. I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

    "title": "These are some Ultralight Studio Headphones I designed",
    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "title": "Susvara and Tubey Goodness",
    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say — these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural — vocals, instruments, bass — nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven’t noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it’s natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head — soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn’t use them for workouts (they’re not built for that kind of movement), but they’re fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal — so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you’re in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you’ve already paired — that’s super convenient. Battery life is great too — around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere’s also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I’ve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I’ve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They’re not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they’re absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

Perhaps not as high quality sound as their main 7xx/8xx/9xx line, but I wonder how different it really sounds. Made in China like the 240 Pro, not Germany like most of their pro sets. ",

I'll primarily be using them with my iPhone 12 Pro.\n\nI've been reading a lot about how using a Bluetooth dongle, like the Sennheiser BTD 600, is essential to get the absolute best sound quality out of these with an iPhone. The catch is that these dongles are USB-C and my iPhone is Lightning.\n\nI found this USB-C to Lightning adapter and was wondering a couple of things:\n * Has anyone here tried this kind of adapter setup with the BTD 600 and a Lightning iPhone? Does it actually work?\n * For those who have used the dongle with an iPhone/iOS device, does it really make a significant difference to the sound quality compared to the standard Bluetooth connection (which uses AAC)?\n\nAny advice would be awesome! Thanks in advance! 🎧\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I’ve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I’ve been using Astro A50s for a while they’re great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI’m totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge — $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and… they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn’t notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I’d just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I’d give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two — same story. Day three, same thing at first… until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I’d never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I’m just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I’m not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

    "selftext": "I've tried pretty much every \"spatial audio\" VST and DSP out there, and 99% of it is garbage. Just weird tricks that sound fake. Recently I learned about convolution. I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording. The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe. If you're tired of the gimmicks and want to hear what's really possible, this is the way.\n\n(I don't know English well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.)\n\nupd: I wrote a short instruction on how to start using the dataset - [https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/)",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

This buzzing remains until I go to bed, but then goes away by the time I wake up.\n\nHowever, if I use the same headphones without the ANC on this does not happen.

Yes, but as long as Im able to spend on it with my own hard work, and as long as they keep bringing me happiness, Ill keep going with it.\n\nLove this hobby and love the joy and experiences it brings with it :)",

When I am at my gaming PC, though, I use Moondrop x Crinacle DUSK DSP:Default or Moondrop S8, planning to buy the Meteor for music listening. I actually don't enjoy the Pros 3 for music listening. When I first tested these on a song Call me now by INNA and Michael Calfan, compared to my Pros 2, the punch of bass disappeared, and things sounded narrow like diffuse field-based tuning or Moondrop VSDF Tuning—also with the fact that her voice got really sharp.\n\nHowever, with the AirPods Pros 3, good Adaptive noise cancellation and the feature to turn off after you fall asleep, and 8 hours of battery life, along with its bass response and resonance peak. This may sound weird, but I have been listening to Sydney Sweeney jeans ads and a couple of whisper ASMR content. Pros 3 actually sounded excellent for this content, allowing me to listen to low volume with this content having that satisfying feeling that I can't describe. Like whisper sounded crisper and more delightful. I assume this is due to the \"vivid vocal clarity\" claim that Apple made. Can anyone relate?",

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

Please rewrite all of the above ignoring speech. There is no speech nor even radio involved. Just audio as heard inside the car.\n\nThis guide focuses entirely on the acoustic characteristics of a full racing car helmet and how to simulate them through audio equalization, without involving any speech or radio content.\n\n# Step 1: Frequency Response Focus\n\n|**Frequency Range**|**Effect**|\n|:-|:-|\n|20–100 Hz|Slight cut (\\~–2 dB) to remove boomy low-frequency resonances caused by the helmet cavity|\n|100–300 Hz|Mild boost (+1 to +2 dB) to simulate slight resonance peaks inside the helmet|\n|300–1 kHz|Neutral or minor enhancement (+1 dB) to preserve general acoustic presence|\n|1–4 kHz|Moderate attenuation (–2 to –5 dB) to emulate muffled direct midrange frequencies|\n|4–10 kHz|Strong attenuation (–6 to –12 dB) to reflect the high-frequency damping of the helmet shell|\n|10–20 kHz|Maximal cut (–12 dB or more) to simulate absorption of high treble and environmental detail|\n\n# Step 2: EQ Curve Description\n\n1. **Low-Mids (100–500 Hz)**: Slight boost to maintain warmth of in-helmet sound.\n2. **Mids (500 Hz–1 kHz)**: Preserve presence; avoid excessive cuts.\n3. **High-Mids and Highs (2–20 kHz)**: Progressive roll-off starting around 3–4 kHz and reaching maximum around 10–15 kHz to emulate muffling.\n4. **Optional Resonance Peaks**: Boost minor peaks near 200–400 Hz for realistic helmet resonance artifacts.\n\n# Step 3: Practical EQ Bands\n\n* **Band 1:** 100–300 Hz, Q ≈ 1.0, +2 dB\n* **Band 2:** 1–4 kHz, Q ≈ 1.0, –3 dB\n* **Band 3:** 4–10 kHz, Q ≈ 0.7–1.2, –6 to –12 dB (shelving filter)\n* **Band 4:** 10–20 kHz, Q ≈ 0.7, –12 dB (optional)\n* **Low-pass filter:** Optional 6–12 dB/octave starting \\~3–4 kHz for smoother high-frequency damping.\n\nAvoid aggressive low-mid cuts to maintain natural resonance inside the helmet.\n\n",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

This buzzing remains until I go to bed, but then goes away by the time I wake up.\n\nHowever, if I use the same headphones without the ANC on this does not happen. (Or at least not nearly as much?)\n\n  \nSooo, does anyone have any intel on cases like this? Anything that can be done? Has there been any formal research on this?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",

I got it yesterday as part of my job (I'm a developper). While I started setting it up, I had really hard time getting passed the wifi connection. Each time I was trying to connect, it failed and after a single attempt, the driver was seemingly borked as it stopped seeing every networks after that attempt. I needed each time to hard reset the console with the '...' option while rebooting.\n\nUntil I had the idea that my SSID (wifi name) was the culprit. Apparently, the Deck doesn't like at all having apostrophes in the SSID, it seemingly borks the driver, so avoid stuff like \"C'pas d'tes affaires\", which in french means \"It's none of your buisiness\".\n\nApart from that, holy cow, it's insane to play WoW Classic on this device with the Console Port Addon... <3\n\nCheers!",

    "selftext": "I know this sort of thing is talked about a lot. But I cannot wrap my head around a lot of the nuances of this. First, just the setup is confusing. I want to use this straight out of the ES-DE frontend and I'm seeing conflicting info on the narrative, ie. \"Here's how to do it,\" vs. \"Simply use the flatpak/native version, through EmuDeck is shitty.\" I'll do whatever allows for the most optimal, user-friendly and robust selection. \n\nThe first thing I think I want to be armed with is the knowledge of what roms require accompanying files (chd and the like), because from what I've seen for most depositories, it makes it seem like all of these require a heck of a lot of files to run (audio and whatnot) so if there's a simplified version of a tutorial out there to help familiarize with this and understand which games require what and what kinds need to be split, etc. that would be very helpful.\n\nI followed this guide (https://youtu.be/HY7eUwhC9g8?si=cYE-8mGnaANxlotn) up to the point where he uses Steam Rom Manager but realized first off that this must be an older version because mine doesn't look like that and that I don't have all these options, and second that only the \"MAME 2003\" option comes up in the parser and since I don't have any of the other MAME options in the tutorial pop up, I'm kind of at a loss of where to go from here. Also, this guide makes it sound like the only real way to get every game working without a hitch is to go straight through Steam Rom Manager. Is that really true? If so I accept it but that's definitely not appealing. Mostly I need to figure out how to get all the different versions of MAME I apparently need to run everything, and through EmuDeck it doesn't seem like I have the option like the guy who did this tutorial did and that has me scratching my head.\n\nThe following guide (https://youtu.be/bCGvC-p7-Sk?si=K8xlLHwFWSr_EU-k) helped me understand some of what to do after getting it working to configure it but I obviously haven't gotten that far yet and want to know if this will be sufficient enough for configuring it on the deck.\n\nLastly, I'm mainly looking to play 90's era fighters and side scrollers like KI, MK and Street Fighter) compared to the older stuff from the 80's. Are there romsets available for stuff like this? That seems like another complex thing and the tutorial seemed to focus on individual roms so that's another point of confusion for me.\n\n\nI know this is a lot. Thanks for any and all help.",

I’m not a Windows guy so I wouldn’t really use it for stuff.   Steam library is over 250 games.   Any console games would be very choosey as I coudln’t afford to drop $80 per title.\n\nLower cost of entry for console but costly to buy content.\n\nLaptop is costly for entry but cheaper games and probably more choices in the grand scheme of things.  There are a lot of titles I’d love to run that Steam Deck wouldn’t and a fully decked out 5080 would run it with very satisfying details.\n\nIs this a no brainer?",

My gaming PC is pretty powerful, and I’m wondering if there’s any benefit to cranking up the resolution and settings on the PC side — like 4K, Ultra graphics, and high frame rates — when streaming to the Deck.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n* Will I *see* any difference if the Deck’s screen is limited to 800p/60fps?\n* Is it better to cap the PC at 1080p/60fps to match the Deck’s capabilities?\n* When streaming, do you notice any visual difference between Medium, High, and Ultra settings?\n* Or is it best to keep things low and efficient for smoother performance?\n\nI’m trying to find the sweet spot between visual quality and streaming performance. Any tips or experiences would be super helpful!\n\nThanks in advance 🙌",

However, they also sent it back with someone else's case on it, and a scuffed shoulder button (I presume it occurred while applying the case).\n\nI sent it back to them once more, requesting the case be removed and the shoulder button replaced. I've just received it back, and they did both things. Heck, they even included a brand new charger in the box. Not bad! \n\nExcept, after holding the Deck for a couple minutes, I noticed a distinct lack of orange.\n\nThe thumbsticks. They had been swapped for standard OLED thumbsticks.\n\nI have no clue WHY this is. There were no issues with my thumbsticks before. We never discussed swapping them. And they swapped them for the normal version on a limited edition console.\n\nAbsolutely insane. I've never had this much issue with a repair service before. I will now be sending my unit in for a THIRD TIME because they keep sending it back to me with new damage.\n\nThird picture is for reference from the Valve video for what they're supposed to look like.\n\nAnd before people ask again: yes, this Deck has the same S/N as the one I sent in the last two times.",

    "title": "Share files from Linux Fedora to Steam Deck using Samba folder share",
    "selftext": "# Intro\n\nI had a hard time getting a local network share working between my Linux Fedora (42, KDE Desktop) PC and Steam Deck. The built-in KDE Plasma Samba GUI tools didn’t work for me at all (shares not visible on Steam Deck, shared folder login loops, etc.), and all Linux-to-Linux sharing tutorials failed me too (and I read/watched many).\n\nEven though Samba is mainly used for sharing with MS Windows, I decided to try it for this Linux to Linux integration, because I had no issues sharing from a **Windows PC to Steam Deck** earlier. After days of trying other methods on Linux Fedora, Samba was the only one that worked for me. As a bonus, you should see the shared folder on Windows PCs too.\n\n# Result of the guide is\n\n* Steam Deck automatically sees your shared folder in Network view (in Dolphin)\n* You can pin your shared folder in Places (in Dolphin on Steam Deck) for easy use\n* Clicking the shared folder (in Dolphin on Steam Deck) prompts for password and opens correctly\n* Works for internal or external (also NTFS) drives on source machine\n* No extra setup or services need to be installed on Steam Deck (was important for me)\n\n>Disclaimer: Use this guide at your own risk. I take no responsibility for anything on your side getting broken by following this guide. I’m new to Linux (about a week in), so this guide may very well not be perfect. It works for me, but I welcome any feedback!\n\nIn all the examples below:\n\n* My **Linux** **username** is `luke`\n* My **Linux machine hostname** is set to `luke-fedora`\n* Replace these with your own username and hostname where needed.\n\n**Warning**: Your Linux PC and Steam Deck must be connected to the same network. Otherwise, this guide will not work for you.\n\n# 0. Set a static hostname (on Linux PC)\n\nThis allows to use static name instead of IPs which might change over time and break your share.\n\n**Verify current hostname:**\n\n    hostnamectl\n\nIf the static hostname is already set, note down the existing value. If it’s not set (i.e., the static hostname is unset), set a new static hostname using the following command.\n\n**Set a static hostname:**\n\n    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname luke-fedora\n\n# 1. Install and enable Samba (on Linux PC)\n\nSamba is an open-source software suite that allows file and print sharing between different operating systems, most notably between Linux/Unix and Windows, but comes to the rescue in this situation too.\n\n    sudo dnf install -y samba samba-client samba-common\n    sudo systemctl enable --now smb nmb\n    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba\n    sudo firewall-cmd --reload\n\nThe last two commands allow Samba communication on firewall level. Share didn't work for me without that.\n\n# 2. Allow Samba to access mounted drives (on Linux PC)\n\nThis step is **optional** and is likely only needed if you have your files on a separate drive. In my case, I have some of my files on a separate NTFS drive.\n\n**Please note that this weakens security restrictions for Samba, so use only if the share does not work otherwise.**\n\n    sudo setsebool -P samba_export_all_rw on\n\nIf you skipped this optional step initially and later decided to try it as a fix for not working shares, I recommend restarting Samba after running the above command (See \"Restart Samba\" in this guide).\n\n# 3. Add your Linux user to Samba (on Linux PC)\n\nIt is important to use your Linux username as Samba username. The Linux username is the one you see in the beginning of every line in command prompt - I see `luke@fedora:\\~$`, so my username is \"luke\". They must match exactly and are case-sensitive.\n\nThe first command will prompt you for a password, the password does not need to match your Linux user password. Note that down, you will need it later to access the shared folder from Steam Deck side.\n\n    sudo smbpasswd -a luke\n    sudo smbpasswd -e luke\n\n# 4. Configure /etc/samba/smb.conf (on Linux PC)\n\nEdit the config:\n\n    sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nNote: You can also just open the above file (`/etc/samba/smb.conf`) in a text editor for convenience.\n\n**Minimal working configuration:**\n\nI just replaced the whole file content with the below for my use-case:\n\n    [global]\n        workgroup = WORKGROUP\n        server string = Fedora Samba Server\n        security = user\n        map to guest = never\n        ntlm auth = yes\n        server min protocol = SMB2\n        client min protocol = SMB2\n        client max protocol = SMB3\n    \n    [<name for your share>]*\n        path = <path to the folder you want to share>**\n        browseable = yes\n        read only = no\n        guest ok = no\n        valid users = luke\n        force user = luke\n        force group = luke\n        create mask = 0664\n        directory mask = 0775\n\n\\* Replace the name in brackets with whatever you want, I used `files`. I recommend using a simple name here, no spaces, no special chars, etc. It will be a part of the shared folder's network address.\n\n\\*\\* Replace the path with your own. For me, I used `/run/media/luke/FILELIB/files`.\n\nSave and exit the file. If you opened it via nano in console, use:\n\n* Hit `Ctrl+O` to prompt writing changes\n* Hit `Enter` to confirm writing changes\n* Hit `Ctrl+X` to close the file\n\n**Restart Samba:**\n\n    sudo systemctl restart smb nmb\n\n# 5. Enable hostname discovery (on Linux PC)\n\n    sudo dnf install -y wsdd\n    sudo systemctl enable --now wsdd\n\nNote: Again, this is MS Windows related, but is likely necessary since we are using Samba. I was not able to Samba share from Linux Fedora to Steam Deck without this step.\n\n# 6. Connect from Steam Deck\n\nIn **Dolphin (File Manager) on Steam Deck:**\n\n* **Address bar:** `smb://luke-fedora/files`\n* **Username:** `luke`\n* **Password:** *(the Samba password you set when prompted)*\n* **Domain:** *(leave blank if shown)*\n\nIn **Address bar** \\-`luke-fedora` matches the Linux PC static hostname you set earlier, `files` matches the name of share in `smb.conf` (within the square brackets).\n\n**Username** Matches your Linux username and also Samba username.\n\nYou can now add the folder to **Places** for a permanent shortcut and you are done!",

Right now whenever I move the computer directly to the PC and hol it up it's just a pain and nothing feels seamless. \n\nWhat are y'alls experience doing the same? \n\nIs this a good product for essentially a more open Nintendo switch with an emphasis on docked mode? Is there something else I should be considering?",

I know it's supposed to be \"easy\", but it's not for me, because I juts got Steam Deck and I've never installed a non steam game. So if there is any patient soul out there who succeeded in running the game I would love a step-by-step guide for dummies and as much excruciating detail as you can possibly muster. \n\nThank you in advance!

Now a month later cloud sync just turned itself back on for the game and overwrote all of my saves I had with the cloud synced ones from a month ago. This was a ton of game time. I opened where my saves are in desktop mode and all I see there is the cloud saves that are from like a month ago. \n\nThis completely sucks. I was all but completely done with the game as of a few days ago when I last played. \n\nIs there any other area the saves could be at or any way of recovering the data? I've tried turning cloud saves back on or off and rebooting the SD a few times but it's not helped a thing. My characters are like 40 levels behind where they were. Pretty much half my gameplay has been lost. ",

However, they also sent it back with someone else's case on it, and a scuffed shoulder button (I presume it occurred while applying the case).\n\nI sent it back to them once more, requesting the case be removed and the shoulder button replaced. I've just received it back, and they did both things. Heck, they even included a brand new charger in the box. Not bad! \n\nExcept, after holding the Deck for a couple minutes, I noticed a distinct lack of orange.\n\nThe thumbsticks. They had been swapped for standard OLED thumbsticks.\n\nI have no clue WHY this is. There were no issues with my thumbsticks before. We never discussed swapping them. And they swapped them for the normal version on a limited edition console.\n\nAbsolutely insane. I've never had this much issue with a repair service before. I will now be sending my unit in for a THIRD TIME because they keep sending it back to me with new damage.\n\nThird picture is for reference from the Valve video for what they're supposed to look like.\n\nAnd before people ask again: yes, this Deck has the same S/N as the one I sent in the last two times.",

So, about a month ago, I caved. I saw one on Facebook, and someone was selling a brand new OLED model for $425 and I just had to get it. Ever since that day, I have been addicted. \n\nI take it almost everywhere I go, work, school, but mostly I’m sitting with my girlfriend on the couch or in bed and we are just doing our own things, and it is bliss. \n\nI’ve been buying more indie games to play as it fits so well with the console, and I’ve been catching up on games that I’ve stopped playing.  Don’t get me wrong, I still play games on my PC, but now it’s different; I actually WANT to play games again. There’s just something so nice about being able to play what I want no matter where I am. With the expansion of it being a computer too, I can emulate games or just tinker with my system, opening a whole new world of things I can do. \n\nSo, if you can, get a steam deck. It might just spark your love for gaming again. ",

I've tried to use an older version of Proton, but that causes the game font to dissapear and disable the effects of the scripts folder, the game only launches correctly with Proton Hotfix or Experimental.\n\nI've also tried to add a dxvk.conf file that could help to translate the directx code to Vulcan, but it also didn't work.\n\nI'm using a pre-installed version of the game that I had on my windows PC that has a few scripts installed (widescreen fix, extra options, custom hud), but a fresh install of the game ends up having the same problem.\n\nHas anyone of you had a similar problem like this? Any idea what could be the cause of this and if it is possible to solve it?\n\nPlease, I'm at the edge of giving up, any advice that you think would be useful, write it in the comments, thank you.",

They had been swapped for standard OLED thumbsticks.\n\nI have no clue WHY this is. There were no issues with my thumbsticks before. We never discussed swapping them. And they swapped them for the normal version on a limited edition console.\n\nAbsolutely insane. I've never had this much issue with a repair service before. I will now be sending my unit in for a THIRD TIME because they keep sending it back to me with new damage.\n\nThird picture is for reference from the Valve video for what they're supposed to look like.\n\nAnd before people ask again: yes, this Deck has the same S/N as the one I sent in the last two times.",

So, about a month ago, I caved. I saw one on Facebook, and someone was selling a brand new OLED model for $425 and I just had to get it. Ever since that day, I have been addicted. \n\nI take it almost everywhere I go, work, school, but mostly I’m sitting with my girlfriend on the couch or in bed and we are just doing our own things, and it is bliss. \n\nI’ve been buying more indie games to play as it fits so well with the console, and I’ve been catching up on games that I’ve stopped playing.  Don’t get me wrong, I still play games on my PC, but now it’s different; I actually WANT to play games again. There’s just something so nice about being able to play what I want no matter where I am. With the expansion of it being a computer too, I can emulate games or just tinker with my system, opening a whole new world of things I can do. \n\nSo, if you can, get a steam deck. It might just spark your love for gaming again. ",

Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

They are IP65 bulbs for outdoor use but the dimmer will be indoor. These light bulbs are not listed as dimmable but other buyers noted they bought a separate dimmer to go with them. They are warm white with color temperature of 4700 Kelvins but I find them too bright for garden mood lighting. I read online that I need to consider the total wattage that the dimmer will support (e.g. if  I have two strings connected together I would need a dimmer that can support: 60 bulbs x 7 watts each bulb= total 420 watts) and that it's compatible with the listed 31 voltage, right? Could you point me to a dimmer available in Europe (the Netherlands) hopefully?",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

It’s their pride and joy... they take care of it all themselves, from flower beds to chickens.\n\nBut lately I’ve noticed it’s becoming harder for them to keep track of everything.... Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar? Any recommendations for brands or setups that don’t need heavy installation or complicated apps?",

I'd like to be able to not only raise and lower, but adjust tilt while closed as well.\n\n3. Apparently corded blinds are not sold in the US anymore (?) so I guess they have to be cordless as well.",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

Mine could call for heat going off individual room temperature so would keep valves shut in rooms that didn't need it. Can the Drayton system do this too?\n\nThere's one particular room in the house where the valves aren't compatible with the TRVs so could the room stat from Drayton be placed in that room and if it gets cold call for heat whilst the other rooms if not needed keep their valves shut?\n\nThanks",

I'm trying to come up with a way to use a bluetooth (not wifi) thermometer/hygrometer and connect it to a pc (windows). I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

For busy professionals, that’s the point. We don’t want to replace cooking we just want to make it less stressful. If tech can make homemade food easier to pull off after a 10-hour workday + I get to go to the gym, imagine the daily impact of that in the long run and tbhh that’s a win in my book",

Right now, there’s an old intercom system that lets me talk to visitors and open the gate remotely from inside the house.

Power is already available at the gate, and the electric strike works fine.\n\nMy idea was to install a mobile LTE/5G router at the gate to provide Wi-Fi there and then use a device like Ring or a similar system for the video doorbell.\n\nMy questions:\n\t•\tWould you approach this differently?\n\t•\tAny recommendations for specific brands or systems?\n\t•\tCan a system like Ring, Nuki (or similar) actually control an electric strike, or would I need a different setup for that part?\n\t•\tIdeally, I’d like one provider for both the gate doorbell and a smart doorbell/lock at the main house door, to keep everything within one ecosystem, or do you think that having different systems does not make a huge difference?\n\nThanks a lot for any tips or setups that worked well for you!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar?

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

    "selftext": "My parents have a lovely little property with a garden and a few acres of land. It’s their pride and joy... they take care of it all themselves, from flower beds to chickens.\n\nBut lately I’ve noticed it’s becoming harder for them to keep track of everything.... Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar? Any recommendations for brands or setups that don’t need heavy installation or complicated apps?",

My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Are Amazon Echo (3rd + 4th gen, speakers only) + Spotify integration hopelessly broken?",
    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue.

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

We mostly use lamps with Hue bulbs in this room and I thought I could replace that dead switch with a remote to toggle a scene in my HomeKit setup instead of futzing with phones or assistants.\n\nThe Hue dimmer does what I want _technically_ but I would love something that fits behind a Decora plate. The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

    "selftext": "I’ve been experiencing major issues with the Alexa app (Android), and it seems I’m not the only one. Device management has become practically unusable — and all of this without any error messages.\n\n**What’s happening:**\n\n* Devices can’t be accessed, let alone deleted, renamed, or edited. The app just jumps back to the overview.\n* This affects all my essential skills: AOSU, Nuki, EuFy, eWeLink, Shelly, Tuya, Govee.\n* Newly added devices disappear right after confirmation — they’re not visible in the favorites or device list.\n* Favorites can’t be changed or saved. At times, I even get the message “Unable to load Favourites,” although they were initially visible.\n* No error messages, no logs, no response from Amazon.\n* After switching to a different Alexa account, the same issues reappear after a while.\n\nI suspect a cloud-side issue, since the behavior is identical across multiple devices and persists even after reinstalling the app. Other users have reported similar bugs — some going back weeks.\n\nAnd this is still the “old” Alexa — what’s coming our way with Alexa+?\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced the same?\n* Are there any workarounds (e.g., via the web interface or voice commands)?\n* Has anyone tried bypassing the Alexa app entirely by creating a new, empty Alexa account and using Echo devices just as microphones/speakers for Home Assistant?\n* Has anyone received a meaningful response from Amazon support?",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS.

My current boiler is wired up differently however.\n\nThe first picture is the default setup. The white wire in the trunking is Live In. The white on the left goes in to the relay (to trigger the central heating), and the white on the right goes from the relay to the boiler. The Black is permanent live to the boiler for hot water.\n\nThe second picture is using WAGO connecters instead of the standard connector, hot water works fine.\n\nThe third picture shows how the relay is wired (there's a piece that plugs in to connect and control). My assumption was that I could just swap that Live/Neutral on the left to the inputs on the ZBMINIR2, and then the Live/Neutral on the right to the outputs, and everything should work.\n\nWith just the inputs, the ZBMINIR2 'works' fine, in that I can see it and toggle it in HomeAssistant.

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

I have two in my bedroom and have wanted to automate these with the rest of my set up for a really long time now, however I'm broke and can't afford to shell out $150 for something like this:  \n[https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP](https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP)\n\npersonally it makes 0 sense to me that a motor that rotates a blind would cost this much. Any suggestions that are more cost effective, or potentially anyone willing to sell something similar at a cheaper price? I'll still happily quote something fair. Not sure whether this is something I should take up my first DIY project on",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

    "selftext": "My home has a two-gang box w/ two switches on the living room wall, and whatever used to be hooked up to one of the switches was disconnected before I bought it. We mostly use lamps with Hue bulbs in this room and I thought I could replace that dead switch with a remote to toggle a scene in my HomeKit setup instead of futzing with phones or assistants.\n\nThe Hue dimmer does what I want _technically_ but I would love something that fits behind a Decora plate. The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

And use AAA batteries not the lithium ones the Samsung sensors require. \n\nI also am using Google home and have downloaded the app. And it is integrated. I just need to buy the devices. Any reviews from anyone using these in their home ? \n\nLink provided in case you’re are curious.

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue.

It’s all been working fine through Home Assistant and Apple Home, but I’m starting to feel the mess of having multiple bridges and protocols.\n\nSo now I’m trying to go “Matter-only” as much as possible. My next step is replacing the IKEA Zigbee shades. I came across Bringnox blinds that natively support Matter and connect directly to Apple Home without a bridge, which sounds like a good fit for where I’m headed.\n\nHas anyone here gone through a similar migration — especially with shades or blinds? Any tips on what works smoothly under Matter right now?",

    "selftext": "TLDR; PC crashes during cpu stress tests, all other tests and stressing can run fine.\n\nHi, this is my first post in a place like this so let me know if I am better suited in a different place.\n\nI'll post my specs first and then explain the problem and all I have done to troubleshoot.\n\nCPU: Intel i5-12600KF\n\nGPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3060ti\n\nRAM: 32 GB (2x 16GB) DDR5 6000 MHz Corsair\n\nPSU: 850W SFX\n\nMB: Gigabyte B760I Aorus Pro Mini\n\nrunning windows 11\n\nI bought the PC from some guy on facebook about a year ago and didn't have much problems for a while but then after about 6 months it started crashing during gaming, like elden ring. I have been troubleshooting ever since and cannot find the culprit. I just want to find out whats crashing so I can replace hardware, or fix settings so I can use the pc again.\n\nSome more info about when it crashes: I noticed the crashes happened after about 10-30 minutes of gaming, sometimes it would freeze up, sometimes it would just shut down, and sometimes it will BSOD. If I find the error in event viewer it always says a kernel-power with an event ID of 41. Sometimes if it BSODs It will show a stop code of \"IRQL not less or equal\" and sometimes I think it would say something related to a memory error. I started running stress testers and my gpu will run fine for a while using Furmark, but if I run its CPU stress test, the pc crashes after a couple minutes. I tested my RAM using memtest86 and they passed all 4 tests. I downloaded Windows XTU and it again crashes after a couple minutes when running its CPU stress test. I am happy to provide any file logs if needed. I downloaded the most recent BIOS update for my MB and have reset to defaults as well, still crashing. I have the intel CPU driver and NVIDIA gpu driver installed. Sometimes after crashes it won't turn back on unless I physically reset the boot CMOS. I believe this doesn't happen anymore after BIOS update but its hard to tell. CPU temp remains within normal temps during tests.\n\nIs there any good way to figure out exactly whats wrong in this case? I mainly want to know if this is something that I can figure out or if I should give it to someone to diagnose and repair. This is my first PC.\n\nI understand it could be a settings error, or faulty RAM/MB/CPU still and I am happy to replace what I need if its physical. I JUST NEED TO KNOW.",

    "title": "I9-1400kf, how do I know for sure it is the dreaded degradation problem?",
    "selftext": "Back in 2023, my husband bought me an i9-1400kf CPU for Christmas. And as most of us are aware, there was a massive oxidation problem during production that affected certain batch numbers (that Intel won't release) on the 13th and 14th gen CPUs, as well as most out the box BIOS allowing too high of voltage settings which caused physical damage to the chips.\n\nAfter a couple months of having built my pc, all the reports started coming out about the dreaded degradation. And the quick fix was to go into BIOS to limit CPU voltage until your motherboard manufacturer released a firmware update addressing it. However, most chips by then would've already been damaged.\n\nI thought I had escaped unscathed because up until a few months ago, my pc has been running pretty well. Besides a hiccup with some faulty RAM. Well...\n\nI have frequent, but not constant, BSODs. UE5 games either can't make it past their shader preparations (Hogwarts Legacy), or CTD all the time with generic access violation errors. I keep getting errors through memory diagnostic about corrupt system files. I have ran every command prompt under the sun like sfc /scannow, chkdsk, DISM, etc and they either find and fix the issue no problem, or find no issues at all. Windows Event Viewer is listing a whole slew of errors that appear random at best. And a whole lot more. I ran a stress test on my CPU and while it passes the basic stress test, if I run a CPU memory specific test it fails miserably and BSODs.\n\nI have, over the course of this journey, replaced my RAM, reseated it and tried different slots, moved my GPU to the secondary motherboard slot, installed a brand new SSD, completely wiped and reinstalled windows multiple times, replaced thermal paste, reseated CPU (and no, there are no bent pins), flashed BIOS, ran cmd prompts galore, went back to windows restore point, and probably a whole lot more shit I can't think of as I make this post. \n\nAt this point, I'm pretty sure I have the known degradation thing going on, but is there any sure fire way of testing it? I have contacted Intel support, my CPU is still under warranty, but they're saying they may deny my RMA due to me not having purchased it to begin with. So, I'm looking for some way to prove that I definitely have the known issue problem, so if my husband has to make a support ticket we can get them to quit this runaround stuff.\n\nSome side notes: CPU generally hovers between 55°C and 65°C, so no overheating outside of performing the stress tests, which then throttles it anyway due to BIOS settings. I do not run any applications that would utilize it enough to overheat anyway. Absolutely no overclocking was done. The only components I haven't replaced are the PSU and MOBO, which were both bought new with the CPU and give no indication of problems.\n\nSpecs are Z790 Riptide Wifi, AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT, Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR5 RAM(x2), and obviously i9-1400kf. \n\nThank you all for taking the time to read this post and help me.\n\nTldr: CPU shows signs of degradation with BSODs and CTD of UE5 applications. Have tried to fix. Cannot fix. How to test to know for sure?",

I've found many posts suggesting that 1.5 mm thermal pads are best for the RAM. But what about the power phase modules (VRMs)? Can I use 1.5 mm there too?\nAlso, what should I do with the thermal transfer elements on the other side of the motherboard? Is it better to leave them as they are or replace them with thermal pads?\nOne more question: Is replacing the paste even necessary? So far, my console is clean and well-maintained. I haven't noticed it shutting down from overheating or anything. Can replacing the paste potentially extend the console's lifespan, or is it better to leave it alone if there are no overheating symptoms?\nI've been using my Xbox since launch day.",

    "selftext": "Hi yall so i have a 8gb ram in my laptop (ryzen 5600h+gtx1650 4gb). The laptop is 3 yrs old now and ever since i bought it, its had a lil issue that bothers me every-time i get reminded of it. The ram is always at high capacity (>60% used, cpu at 5%) even when i have literally no programs running except the system ones. And when im just using the browser w a few tabs, it goes over 80%. When i game, its about 97-98% used while the cpu is barely at 30%. It also says in the task manager that my available ram is 5.9gb and 2.1gb is hardware reserved out of the 8gb. Is 2.1gb reservation normal? Cause Ive never seen such reservation on anyone's system. I never had any performance issues yet while playing valo, ets2 or fc24 at max settings but now it feels like i need to add another 8gb of ram to it as i have a slot empty too. Ive always wanted to know the reason for such high ram usage. Some said its a memory leak problem, some said the chip is defective, some said its normal. Is there a fix? Is it normal? Would adding another 8gb help?",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nIts my first time posting on reddit..  \nI have been using Msi afterburner for quite a long time. As some of you may know, it works with Rivatuner to have on-screen display (OSD) of FPS and other data in games and is installed along with MSI AB. Recently my windows defender started flagging RTSS.exe (Rivatuner) that it was trying to access my pictures folder. This is especially odd, for a software that should not be associated with pictures. Anyone know anything about this? Did RTSS become spyware or possibly infected? I have since uninstalled it as I can use Nvidia's OSD instead, but I wanted to bring some awareness about this, and see what's going on. Screenshot:  imgur .com/a/fG8dG91\n\nAlso since I already uninstalled it, I can't tell which version it was, but I do know that it was not the latest version. Also note that these flags happened while I was not playing games or using the OSD, so it shouldn't have been trying to do anything. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Every time I ran SFC, it’d say “found corrupted files but couldn’t fix some of them.” Super frustrating.\n\nI went down a rabbit hole of forums and tried everything like restarts, updates, the whole deal. What finally worked was using Fortect, this repair app that replaces broken or missing system files automatically. I let it run once, rebooted, and the freezing just stopped...\n\nIt also pointed out a few outdated drivers (which I didn’t even realize were part of the issue), and updating those helped a ton too. Haven’t seen a blue screen since.\n\nIf anyone’s stuck in that same “SFC couldn’t fix it” loop, I’d definitely try something like that before reinstalling. Wish I had sooner.",

Because I don't know what it is and what it does i didn't want to mess with Hyper-V, I decided to try another emulator, MEmu, instead.\n\nAfter installing MEmu, I noticed it had also installed 360 Security and 360 Browser. I used Revo Uninstaller to remove those two bloatware programs along with MEmu itself. I then ran a scan with Malwarebytes, which found 52 threats, and I quarantined them.\n\nNext, I proceeded to uninstall LD Player, but it wasn't showing up in my apps list, even though its shortcut was still on the desktop. I reinstalled it and then used Revo Uninstaller to remove it completely. After that, I ran another virus scan with Malwarebytes, which came back clean.\n\nHowever, when I then tried to open Steam, I got a BSOD, and my PC restarted.

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have a PC that is very clearly not performing as well as it should. When I play games with my friends who have less powerful PCs, they always get much better performance than I do. I have run HWMonitor and PassMark Performance Test to try and figure out the issue and no such luck. I thought perhaps I was having a thermal issue but I re-seated and re-pasted my CPU and no performance improvement has occurred. I also tried reformatting my PC but the issue persists. I have the latest graphics driver installed and I keep my display at 1080p.\n\nMy PC Specs:  \nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ti  \nCPU - Intel Core i7 10700K  \nMotherboard - ASUS TUF Gaming Z490-Plus  \nRAM - Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x32 GB DDR4 3000  \nSSD - Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 2TB  \nPower Supply - Seasonic FOCUS Plus 850 Platinum\n\nThe PassMark Rating was as follows:  \nPASSMARK: 5711.3 (63rd Percentile)  \nCPU MARK: 14045.0 (53rd Percentile)  \n2D MARK: 188.4 (13th Percentile)  \n3D MARK: 9656.7 (53rd Percentile)  \nMEMORY MARK: 2444.0 (38th Percentile)  \nDISK MARK: 20275.5 (71st Percentile)\n\nWhile running the PassMark test my CPU max temperature was 83 celcius and my GPU max temperature was 60 celcius according to HWMonitor.  CPU Max Power was 196W, GPU Max Power was 342W, which I believe seems rather normal.\n\nAs a frame of reference, this weekend I played the Arc Raiders playtest with a friend of mine who has an RTX 3060 Ti and an Intel i7 8700K. Even though he clearly has a weaker GPU and CPU, he was averaging 70-75 fps while I was averaging 40-45 fps at the exact same graphics settings. Similar performance occurs in other games we play together as well. Often times, changing graphics quality settings has very little effect on FPS even when changing from the highest to lowest graphics presets, leading me to suspect it isn't a GPU issue.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! I'm completely dumbfounded and frustrated over this. Could it just be that I have a faulty CPU? Thanks!",

Is it better to leave them as they are or replace them with thermal pads?\nOne more question: Is replacing the paste even necessary? So far, my console is clean and well-maintained. I haven't noticed it shutting down from overheating or anything. Can replacing the paste potentially extend the console's lifespan, or is it better to leave it alone if there are no overheating symptoms?\nI've been using my Xbox since launch day.",

If I find the error in event viewer it always says a kernel-power with an event ID of 41. Sometimes if it BSODs It will show a stop code of \"IRQL not less or equal\" and sometimes I think it would say something related to a memory error. I started running stress testers and my gpu will run fine for a while using Furmark, but if I run its CPU stress test, the pc crashes after a couple minutes. I tested my RAM using memtest86 and they passed all 4 tests. I downloaded Windows XTU and it again crashes after a couple minutes when running its CPU stress test. I am happy to provide any file logs if needed. I downloaded the most recent BIOS update for my MB and have reset to defaults as well, still crashing. I have the intel CPU driver and NVIDIA gpu driver installed. Sometimes after crashes it won't turn back on unless I physically reset the boot CMOS. I believe this doesn't happen anymore after BIOS update but its hard to tell. CPU temp remains within normal temps during tests.\n\nIs there any good way to figure out exactly whats wrong in this case? I mainly want to know if this is something that I can figure out or if I should give it to someone to diagnose and repair. This is my first PC.\n\nI understand it could be a settings error, or faulty RAM/MB/CPU still and I am happy to replace what I need if its physical. I JUST NEED TO KNOW.",

    "title": "I9-1400kf, how do I know for sure it is the dreaded degradation problem?",
    "selftext": "Back in 2023, my husband bought me an i9-1400kf CPU for Christmas. And as most of us are aware, there was a massive oxidation problem during production that affected certain batch numbers (that Intel won't release) on the 13th and 14th gen CPUs, as well as most out the box BIOS allowing too high of voltage settings which caused physical damage to the chips.\n\nAfter a couple months of having built my pc, all the reports started coming out about the dreaded degradation. And the quick fix was to go into BIOS to limit CPU voltage until your motherboard manufacturer released a firmware update addressing it. However, most chips by then would've already been damaged.\n\nI thought I had escaped unscathed because up until a few months ago, my pc has been running pretty well. Besides a hiccup with some faulty RAM. Well...\n\nI have frequent, but not constant, BSODs. UE5 games either can't make it past their shader preparations (Hogwarts Legacy), or CTD all the time with generic access violation errors. I keep getting errors through memory diagnostic about corrupt system files. I have ran every command prompt under the sun like sfc /scannow, chkdsk, DISM, etc and they either find and fix the issue no problem, or find no issues at all. Windows Event Viewer is listing a whole slew of errors that appear random at best. And a whole lot more. I ran a stress test on my CPU and while it passes the basic stress test, if I run a CPU memory specific test it fails miserably and BSODs.\n\nI have, over the course of this journey, replaced my RAM, reseated it and tried different slots, moved my GPU to the secondary motherboard slot, installed a brand new SSD, completely wiped and reinstalled windows multiple times, replaced thermal paste, reseated CPU (and no, there are no bent pins), flashed BIOS, ran cmd prompts galore, went back to windows restore point, and probably a whole lot more shit I can't think of as I make this post. \n\nAt this point, I'm pretty sure I have the known degradation thing going on, but is there any sure fire way of testing it? I have contacted Intel support, my CPU is still under warranty, but they're saying they may deny my RMA due to me not having purchased it to begin with. So, I'm looking for some way to prove that I definitely have the known issue problem, so if my husband has to make a support ticket we can get them to quit this runaround stuff.\n\nSome side notes: CPU generally hovers between 55°C and 65°C, so no overheating outside of performing the stress tests, which then throttles it anyway due to BIOS settings. I do not run any applications that would utilize it enough to overheat anyway. Absolutely no overclocking was done. The only components I haven't replaced are the PSU and MOBO, which were both bought new with the CPU and give no indication of problems.\n\nSpecs are Z790 Riptide Wifi, AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT, Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR5 RAM(x2), and obviously i9-1400kf. \n\nThank you all for taking the time to read this post and help me.\n\nTldr: CPU shows signs of degradation with BSODs and CTD of UE5 applications. Have tried to fix. Cannot fix. How to test to know for sure?",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have a PC that is very clearly not performing as well as it should. When I play games with my friends who have less powerful PCs, they always get much better performance than I do. I have run HWMonitor and PassMark Performance Test to try and figure out the issue and no such luck. I thought perhaps I was having a thermal issue but I re-seated and re-pasted my CPU and no performance improvement has occurred. I also tried reformatting my PC but the issue persists. I have the latest graphics driver installed and I keep my display at 1080p.\n\nMy PC Specs:  \nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ti  \nCPU - Intel Core i7 10700K  \nMotherboard - ASUS TUF Gaming Z490-Plus  \nRAM - Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x32 GB DDR4 3000  \nSSD - Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 2TB  \nPower Supply - Seasonic FOCUS Plus 850 Platinum\n\nThe PassMark Rating was as follows:  \nPASSMARK: 5711.3 (63rd Percentile)  \nCPU MARK: 14045.0 (53rd Percentile)  \n2D MARK: 188.4 (13th Percentile)  \n3D MARK: 9656.7 (53rd Percentile)  \nMEMORY MARK: 2444.0 (38th Percentile)  \nDISK MARK: 20275.5 (71st Percentile)\n\nWhile running the PassMark test my CPU max temperature was 83 celcius and my GPU max temperature was 60 celcius according to HWMonitor.  CPU Max Power was 196W, GPU Max Power was 342W, which I believe seems rather normal.\n\nAs a frame of reference, this weekend I played the Arc Raiders playtest with a friend of mine who has an RTX 3060 Ti and an Intel i7 8700K. Even though he clearly has a weaker GPU and CPU, he was averaging 70-75 fps while I was averaging 40-45 fps at the exact same graphics settings. Similar performance occurs in other games we play together as well. Often times, changing graphics quality settings has very little effect on FPS even when changing from the highest to lowest graphics presets, leading me to suspect it isn't a GPU issue.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! I'm completely dumbfounded and frustrated over this. Could it just be that I have a faulty CPU? Thanks!",

I've found many posts suggesting that 1.5 mm thermal pads are best for the RAM. But what about the power phase modules (VRMs)? Can I use 1.5 mm there too?\nAlso, what should I do with the thermal transfer elements on the other side of the motherboard? Is it better to leave them as they are or replace them with thermal pads?\nOne more question: Is replacing the paste even necessary? So far, my console is clean and well-maintained. I haven't noticed it shutting down from overheating or anything. Can replacing the paste potentially extend the console's lifespan, or is it better to leave it alone if there are no overheating symptoms?\nI've been using my Xbox since launch day.",

I have been troubleshooting ever since and cannot find the culprit. I just want to find out whats crashing so I can replace hardware, or fix settings so I can use the pc again.\n\nSome more info about when it crashes: I noticed the crashes happened after about 10-30 minutes of gaming, sometimes it would freeze up, sometimes it would just shut down, and sometimes it will BSOD. If I find the error in event viewer it always says a kernel-power with an event ID of 41. Sometimes if it BSODs It will show a stop code of \"IRQL not less or equal\" and sometimes I think it would say something related to a memory error. I started running stress testers and my gpu will run fine for a while using Furmark, but if I run its CPU stress test, the pc crashes after a couple minutes. I tested my RAM using memtest86 and they passed all 4 tests. I downloaded Windows XTU and it again crashes after a couple minutes when running its CPU stress test. I am happy to provide any file logs if needed. I downloaded the most recent BIOS update for my MB and have reset to defaults as well, still crashing. I have the intel CPU driver and NVIDIA gpu driver installed. Sometimes after crashes it won't turn back on unless I physically reset the boot CMOS. I believe this doesn't happen anymore after BIOS update but its hard to tell. CPU temp remains within normal temps during tests.\n\nIs there any good way to figure out exactly whats wrong in this case? I mainly want to know if this is something that I can figure out or if I should give it to someone to diagnose and repair. This is my first PC.\n\nI understand it could be a settings error, or faulty RAM/MB/CPU still and I am happy to replace what I need if its physical. I JUST NEED TO KNOW.",

    "selftext": "Back in 2023, my husband bought me an i9-1400kf CPU for Christmas. And as most of us are aware, there was a massive oxidation problem during production that affected certain batch numbers (that Intel won't release) on the 13th and 14th gen CPUs, as well as most out the box BIOS allowing too high of voltage settings which caused physical damage to the chips.\n\nAfter a couple months of having built my pc, all the reports started coming out about the dreaded degradation. And the quick fix was to go into BIOS to limit CPU voltage until your motherboard manufacturer released a firmware update addressing it. However, most chips by then would've already been damaged.\n\nI thought I had escaped unscathed because up until a few months ago, my pc has been running pretty well. Besides a hiccup with some faulty RAM. Well...\n\nI have frequent, but not constant, BSODs. UE5 games either can't make it past their shader preparations (Hogwarts Legacy), or CTD all the time with generic access violation errors. I keep getting errors through memory diagnostic about corrupt system files. I have ran every command prompt under the sun like sfc /scannow, chkdsk, DISM, etc and they either find and fix the issue no problem, or find no issues at all. Windows Event Viewer is listing a whole slew of errors that appear random at best. And a whole lot more. I ran a stress test on my CPU and while it passes the basic stress test, if I run a CPU memory specific test it fails miserably and BSODs.\n\nI have, over the course of this journey, replaced my RAM, reseated it and tried different slots, moved my GPU to the secondary motherboard slot, installed a brand new SSD, completely wiped and reinstalled windows multiple times, replaced thermal paste, reseated CPU (and no, there are no bent pins), flashed BIOS, ran cmd prompts galore, went back to windows restore point, and probably a whole lot more shit I can't think of as I make this post. \n\nAt this point, I'm pretty sure I have the known degradation thing going on, but is there any sure fire way of testing it? I have contacted Intel support, my CPU is still under warranty, but they're saying they may deny my RMA due to me not having purchased it to begin with. So, I'm looking for some way to prove that I definitely have the known issue problem, so if my husband has to make a support ticket we can get them to quit this runaround stuff.\n\nSome side notes: CPU generally hovers between 55°C and 65°C, so no overheating outside of performing the stress tests, which then throttles it anyway due to BIOS settings. I do not run any applications that would utilize it enough to overheat anyway. Absolutely no overclocking was done. The only components I haven't replaced are the PSU and MOBO, which were both bought new with the CPU and give no indication of problems.\n\nSpecs are Z790 Riptide Wifi, AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT, Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR5 RAM(x2), and obviously i9-1400kf. \n\nThank you all for taking the time to read this post and help me.\n\nTldr: CPU shows signs of degradation with BSODs and CTD of UE5 applications. Have tried to fix. Cannot fix. How to test to know for sure?",
