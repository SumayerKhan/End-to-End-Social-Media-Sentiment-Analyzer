    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "iPhone & Wi-Fi 7",
    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7‚Äôs most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> ‚Ä¢ **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3‚Äì4√ó higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time ‚Äî yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple‚Äôs iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism ‚Äî effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it‚Äôs a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn‚Äôt support 240 MHz channels ‚Äî but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple‚Äôs iPhones simply don‚Äôt take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple‚Äôs documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard.

    "title": "The iPhone Upgrade Program is absolutely NOT compatible with AppleCare One",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR: DO NOT try and add your iPhone Upgrade Program iPhone to AppleCare One, unless you want significant problems down the road.**\n\nI added my 16 Pro to AppleCare One in July, a few days after the program started. The support specialist read me boilerplate along the lines of \"In order to remain enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, you must immediately add your phone to AppleCare One to ensure no gap in coverage\". I did that, got a gift card back for \\~$120, and felt happy with myself.\n\nI successfully used the program to get a 17 Pro a few weeks ago, which I picked up in store. However, when I came to return the 16 Pro, the phone was marked as \"Enrolled in iPhone Upgrade Program\", but the option to close the loan was greyed out with \"loan details not found\". The store associates, up to and including supervisors were very confused by this and hadn't seen it before.\n\nAfter approximately **11 hours** on the phone with Citizens, and Apple Support, speaking with about 15 different people, all of whom were very friendly, but none of whom had any idea what had happened, and **3 visits** to the store, I was eventually advised to return the phone as a standalone trade-in, and receive a store gift card. I then had to call a special escalated support number and have them cancel the gift card and close the loan. (It still ended with a 4¬¢ balance, which I then had to pay Citizens by credit card üòÖ)\n\nI eventually had final confirmation from that escalated support line that, despite what AppleCare specialists tell you, and despite the boilerplate coverage language, cancelling the Theft and Loss protection to put your phone into AppleCare One **immediately** cancels the Upgrade Program eligibility. Obviously some systems are aware of this (allowing me to upgrade to 17 Pro), and some are not (preventing me from returning 16 Pro).\n\nI asked about the 17 Pro and confirmed that it too had been removed from the program. They advised me to do a Closed Box return in store and then immediately re-buy the same phone through the program to get it back into eligibility. I tried this, and while I passed the credit check and managed to keep my same phone, Verizon refused to activate the line (presumably because it was already connected - to me). As a result, I couldn't complete the transaction, and ended up having to re-buy my phone outright.\n\nTo Apple's credit, they recognized what a clusterfuck this was, and gave me a credit of $250, which I used for some AirPods Pro 3, and the guy in-store also gave me an Ultra Watch band for free. I also ended up with a negative loan balance of $260, which I got back as a check, and when you add back the $120 gift card back from July, I ended up doing ok. \n\nBut, it was an incredible time and energy suck and I did have to drop $1400 all in one go. I am lucky that I could just do that otherwise I would have left the store without my phone and then who knows what would have happened. I do not recommend this adventure to anyone. \n\nHopefully by the time the next phones are released there will be a proper integrated upgrade path, but for now, if you want to preserve your sanity, just stick with Theft and Loss coverage.\n\n ",

    "title": "Hazel is overkill for 90% of users. Mine works in 3 clicks.",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple! üëã\n\nI'm excited to share Neatify, a macOS productivity app I've been working on for automatic file organization.\n\n# \"Wait, isn't this just Hazel?\"\n\nFair question. I know Hazel exists, and it's an incredibly powerful tool. But here's the thing: Hazel is built for people who love to customize every detail. **Neatify is built for people who want their files organized instantly, without setup or scripting.**\n\n**I made Neatify for people who:**\n\n* Value automation that works right away\n* Want images in one folder, PDFs in another, done\n* Prefer project-based file routing without extra configuration\n* Want clarity instead of complexity\n\nThink of it this way: Hazel is a custom-built PC. Neatify is a MacBook that just works.\n\nBoth are powerful, but one lets you skip the setup and get things done faster.\n\nIf you enjoy building complex automation workflows, Hazel is fantastic. If you just want your files to go where they belong while you focus on your work, Neatify is built for you.\n\n# The Problem I'm Solving\n\nYou're working on multiple projects simultaneously. Literature essay, art history presentation, geopolitics research paper. Files are everywhere. Downloads folder is chaos. Every time you save or download something, you face decision fatigue: \"Where should this go?\"\n\nYou could use Hazel, but after 30 minutes of documentation and rule setup, you're more overwhelmed than when you started.\n\n# How Neatify Works\n\n**üéØ Project-Based Organization**\n\nCreate a project structure in 3 clicks:\n\n1. Name your project (e.g., \"Literature Essay\")\n2. Select file types to manage (Images, PDFs, Presentations)\n3. Choose location (Desktop, Documents, wherever)\n\nDone. Now every image you download automatically goes to Literature Essay/Images. Every PDF to Literature Essay/PDFs. No manual sorting.\n\n**‚ö°Ô∏è Smart File Sorting with Saved Rules**\n\nCreate reusable sorting configurations. One for work, one for personal files, one for creative projects. Switch between them from the menu bar in one click.\n\n**üîÑ Quick Sorter**\n\nNeed to organize something right now? Quick Sorter lets you point at a folder, pick file types, and start sorting immediately. Perfect for one-off tasks.\n\n**üßπ Bulk File Organizer**\n\nGot a messy folder with 500 mixed files? Select it, and Neatify reorganizes everything into a clean structure (Visual/Images, Visual/Videos, Audio, Code/Frontend, Code/Backend, Documents, etc.) in seconds.\n\n**üöÄ Set It and Forget It**\n\nEnable \"Launch at Login\" with a default project or rule. Neatify runs silently in your menu bar. Your files stay organized without you thinking about it.\n\n**üìä Menu Bar Control**\n\nClose the app, it lives in your menu bar. Switch sorting rules, pause/resume, or check status without opening the main window.\n\n# Why I Built This\n\nI was constantly switching between projects and drowning in file chaos. I tried Hazel, spent hours configuring it, felt more stressed, and thought: \"There has to be a simpler way.\"\n\nSo I built Neatify to do one thing really well: keep your files organized so you can focus on your work, not your folders.\n\nIt's 100% native macOS (Swift + SwiftUI), optimized for performance, and follows Apple's design language. No Electron bloat.\n\n# Try the Beta\n\nNeatify is currently in public beta on TestFlight. I'd genuinely love your feedback, especially from anyone who's tried Hazel and found it too heavy, or anyone juggling multiple projects who's tired of file chaos.\n\nBeta Access: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Eyp3uwZS)  \nWebsite: [https://neatifyhq.com](https://neatifyhq.com)  \nDemo: [https://neatifyhq.com/#demo](https://neatifyhq.com/#demo)\n\nI'd Love Your Thoughts On\n\n* Does the \"simpler alternative to Hazel\" positioning make sense?\n* What file organization pain points do you face daily?\n* For Hazel users: what would make you consider a faster, easier tool?\n* Any concerns about automatic file management?\n\nI'll be here all day answering questions, discussing workflows, or debating the merits of different organization philosophies. Thanks for reading! üôè",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

I was waiting 30m until they opened and I showed my phone. \"she said oh sorry this model we cannot fix it due to out of stock.\" OK. I call care plus center again what should i do now? They said you should mail in repair. of course i ask how long it takes? I don't have alternative phone so I really need it asap. They said for sure as soon as receive it, it takes 5 to 7 days. Ok. I sent it Oct 2nd. Today is Oct 20st. Only update I got \"part received\" Oct 10th. So I called and sent mail to them. Only thing I heard from there sorry, you need wait, your phone stuck somewhere. What the fuck? And refund? Refund them will you contact 2-4 days? did you throw your brain somewhere out of State ? Refund what?\n\nBecause of that, I haven't used my banking app, Amazon, whole the application. Are you gonna refund for the my inconvenience?  \n\nHey Guys, if you going to buy Samsung phone, 1st you should not drop it anywhere. When screen get cracked, you will be fucked. 2nd They don't send your phone. They will hold it as hostage.  As Korean, I decided  transfer to apple again. When I use apple, this type of insanely repair processing and customer service never been through. i feel they test people patience. So until when should I keep my patience? Huh Samsung repair center Ssibal. ",

This happens when I switch between video/photo modes as well as click the photo preview to view the most recently taken picture and close out of it to go back into the camera. I assume this isn't normal and I got a defective unit? but with how bulky the lenses are I figured I'd check with the community to make sure I have to take the effort to go get a replacement.",

I'm finding it difficult to navigate with display zoom enabled but the screen otherwise it's too small for my eyes so I'm trying to decide if I return this phone for a 17 pro max. The problem is I wanted a smaller phone because the 12 promax was starting to really hurt my hands and just was overall too big, especially for one-handed text. On photo three I cant even markup the issue on photo one because it doesn't let me get to the problem area I wanted to circle.  Photo two is hard to even click the url bar.",

Maybe we can get a smaller dynamic island; some leaks have also suggested a holepunch camera in the left top corner. *Drop your thoughts and ideas below ASAP and maybe Apple listens*",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

Do they then send it back, you swap again, and send the replacement back?\n\nWhen they repair yours phone due to a broken glass, do they also replace the battery (automatically or upon request)? As it‚Äôs 90% already, it would be a good opportunity to get a refresh battery. \n\nIf we get a refurbished replacement, do they always come with a new battery?\n\nI read online that people just smash up their phone to get a new one or dip it in water, it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me but I really would like the battery to be refreshed (as it dropped to 90% rather quickly) or get a refurbished one without feeling too bad ethically.

Anyway, I haven‚Äôt paid attention to chargers for years, but recently I found that Qi2.2 is a real upgrade in wireless charging.\n\nI also have a Series 10 Watch and AirPods Pro 2, so I‚Äôm looking for something that can charge them all together.\n\nPic2 is the Baseus PicoGo AF21, their 3-in-1 Qi2.2 charger I found on Amazon. Anyone here using it? I used to have one of their HDMI cables back in the day (pretty sure they don‚Äôt make those anymore) and I was happy with it. Wondering if this charger worth it or if there‚Äôs something better I should check out. Thanks everyone!",

    "selftext": "this whole October is hell to me. As a Korean who living in the State I transferred from apple to Samsung. But I did not know Samsung repair processing is hell like this. I can describe 3 words about repair processing and customer service, Disappointed, Awful and Ssibal.  \n\nThis is my story. My galaxy z fold 7 screen got cracked while I was sleeping on the bed. I drooped from the bed so phone got cracked. Thankfully, I have Samsung care plus with my phone so I call to how to deal with it. They ask me to go to serfity store related Samsung so they will fix it. Before I go over there, of course I called my situation, my model and color. The employee said \"Yes we can fix it but it takes 4 hours so i got there 8:30am it took me more than hour. I was waiting 30m until they opened and I showed my phone. \"she said oh sorry this model we cannot fix it due to out of stock.\" OK. I call care plus center again what should i do now? They said you should mail in repair. of course i ask how long it takes? I don't have alternative phone so I really need it asap. They said for sure as soon as receive it, it takes 5 to 7 days. Ok. I sent it Oct 2nd. Today is Oct 20st. Only update I got \"part received\" Oct 10th. So I called and sent mail to them. Only thing I heard from there sorry, you need wait, your phone stuck somewhere. What the fuck? And refund? Refund them will you contact 2-4 days? did you throw your brain somewhere out of State ? Refund what?\n\nBecause of that, I haven't used my banking app, Amazon, whole the application. Are you gonna refund for the my inconvenience?  \n\nHey Guys, if you going to buy Samsung phone, 1st you should not drop it anywhere. When screen get cracked, you will be fucked. 2nd They don't send your phone. They will hold it as hostage.  As Korean, I decided  transfer to apple again. When I use apple, this type of insanely repair processing and customer service never been through. i feel they test people patience. So until when should I keep my patience? Huh Samsung repair center Ssibal. ",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android üëã,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to¬†**WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is¬†**SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

    "selftext": "I've never owned a galaxy S8 (used apple, oneplus, pixel, then my first samsung was my current s24 ultra), but I feel like it's the most influential Android phone in the last 10 years in terms of physical design. It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

    "selftext": "Would love to know some tips and tricks from the experts who have turned and twisted android to create something personal and functional. \n\n\nInitial impressions for me: (First 2 days)\nWhat's better in Android:\n1) The key board - I am not making as many mistakes as I used to when typing on the 14 pro\n2) Autofilling of OTPs - just removed one more step and feels faster \n3) Pixel animations are smooth and fast - atleast better than my 14 pro and my friends 15 pro \n4) Google assistant/ Gemini is just way better \n5) loving the battery on the 10 xl compared to the smaller 14 pro \n6) The universal back gesture. Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

    "selftext": "Hi all! I've been working on something I think you'll find useful. **Media Bar** transforms your Android status bar into a functional media controller and progress indicator.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nInstead of pulling down notifications or switching apps to control your music/podcast/video, you can now:\n\n* **See media progress** as a thin colored bar along your status bar\n* **Swipe left/right** on the status bar to scrub through your media\n* **Tap, double-tap, or long-press** three invisible regions on the status bar for custom actions (play/pause, skip, jump forward/back, launch app, etc.)\n\n**How is this different from Android's Live Notifications or OneUI's Now Bar?**\n\nWhile Android's live notifications and Samsung's Now Bar are excellent features, Media Bar takes a different approach:\n\n* **Always visible, minimal footprint** \\- Just a thin line on your status bar (can be as small as 1 pixel), not a pill or expandable widget that takes screen real estate\n* **Blind muscle memory control** \\- Your entire status bar becomes an interactive surface. No need to look for or tap specific small buttons\n* **Works system-wide** \\- Doesn't matter which media app you're using or which Android skin you have\n* **Swipe to scrub** \\- Directly scrub through your media by swiping, rather than tapping skip buttons\n* **Deep customization** \\- Color coding for progress tracking, custom button zones, transparency options, etc.\n\nThink of it as complementary to those features - it's for when you want the most minimal, muscle-memory-based control possible.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI found myself constantly interrupting my workflow to control media playback - whether I was gaming, browsing, or working. I wanted something that was always visible and accessible without being intrusive.\n\n**The \"aha\" moment:**\n\nHere's the thing - **Media Bar might feel a bit unusual at first, but give it a day or two.** Once your muscle memory kicks in, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n\nImagine this: You're at the gym mid-rep and need to pause your music. Instead of fumbling to find the play button, your thumb just *knows* where to tap on the status bar. Or you're deep into a 3-hour podcast and want to skip ahead - a quick swipe does it without even looking.\n\n**That's the magic**: your fingers learn the zones, and suddenly media control becomes second nature. No more hunting for tiny buttons or pulling focus from what you're doing. It just... flows. I'm confident that once it becomes part of your routine, it'll feel indispensable.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Color coding options** \\- Solid colors, dynamic (based on album art/app), segments (changes color at different progress points), or gradients\n\n**Highly customizable** \\- Adjust the bar's thickness (down to 1 pixel!), position (top/bottom), transparency, button regions, and more\n\n**Smart behavior** \\- Auto-hides in fullscreen apps, works with any media player\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, [get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.mediabar)! I would love to hear what you guys think about it and happy to answer any questions you may have! I would specifically like to hear if you build a muscle memory for it! :)",

The issue got escalated to an incident this morning.\n\nWell, I just got news that Google thinks the Pixel hanging/crashing apps bug is now fixed. I've asked for clarification on whether the fix is server-side or requires a Play Services update. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977868145840050230\n\n**Update**: Alright, got confirmation that the Pixel crashing/hanging apps fix is server-side. There will be a post-mortem within Google, but I'm not sure if it will be made public. Incidents like this one cannot happen again.

    "title": "I Switched from iPhone to Android: My Story of Losses and Gains",
    "selftext": "# Hey Reddit! I want to share my story of switching from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It wasn't just choosing a new phone; it was a real journey full of expectations, doubts, and unexpected discoveries.\n\n# Introduction: Seeking a New Experience\n\nI used an iPhone 13 Pro and it was almost perfect. Even when the Pixel 10 came out, I had no desire to watch the presentation. But over time, I started to feel a \"technological itch.\" I was tired of Apple's predictability and the lack of true innovation. When the 17th iPhone came out again without significant AI improvements, it was the final disappointment. On the horizon appeared the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ‚Äî a symbol of freedom, customization, and powerful AI. This wasn't just a phone choice; it was a choice of a new philosophy. I dreamed of a world where I control my device, not the other way around.\n\n# Part I: Pros and Cons from My Experience\n\niPhone (iOS): The World I Left Behind\n\n‚Ä¢Pros (What I Miss):\n\n‚Ä¢\"Ecosystem magic\" is not a myth, but a reality. It's not just a set of features, but an invisible fabric that connects the family. I acutely felt this when I realized I could no longer see my wife's phone battery charge (a symbol of care) and disappeared from our shared fitness competition (a symbol of play and unity).\n\n‚Ä¢Flawless simplicity (\"It just works\"). AirPods connecting with animation, passwords autofilling without glitches, stable battery performance after updates. This reliability is not \"boring,\" but reassuring. It brings peace of mind, freeing my brain from having to \"fix\" basic things.\n\n‚Ä¢Predictability as an advantage. I always know what to expect. No unpleasant surprises, like a sudden battery drain or strange sleep metrics on the watch after an update. It's a world without rollercoasters.\n\n‚Ä¢Camera philosophy. The iPhone camera strives for a \"cinematic\" reality. It creates volumetric, pleasing-to-the-eye photos immediately, without the need to \"tinker\" with settings.\n\n‚Ä¢Well-designed password system. Passwords seemed like a simple app. But it's so well-designed that you don't need to remember many passwords; importantly, it generates passwords itself and works across other devices.\n\n‚Ä¢Integrated calls and messages. The ability to call other messengers from the built-in call app and a convenient built-in messaging app.\n\n‚Ä¢Health and fitness synchronization. Easy synchronization of a fitness tracker and app with the built-in health app.\n\n‚Ä¢Battery life. I'm impressed that such a small battery lasts an active day. No need to turn off Bluetooth and WiFi to save power.\n\n‚Ä¢User care. Features related to health, diary, and headphone usage monitoring.\n\n‚Ä¢Sound quality. Good sound from the speakers and the phone itself.\n\n‚Ä¢Size and dimensions. Exactly what I was looking for.\n\n‚Ä¢Face ID. A very convenient feature, especially at work where fingerprint unlock might be inconvenient.\n\n‚Ä¢Seamless Bluetooth connection. No problems connecting to Bluetooth devices.\n\n‚Ä¢Reminders. The \"Reminders\" app is very helpful for organizing thoughts and tasks.\n\n‚Ä¢Cons (Why I Left):\n\n‚Ä¢\"Golden cage.\" The feeling of being locked in. Dependence on AirDrop, iMessage, lack of flexibility. The desire to break free and try something new was incredibly strong.\n\n‚Ä¢Illusion of innovation. Annual updates brought minimal changes but cost maximum money. It felt like a waste.\n\n‚Ä¢Lack of control. I can't customize the system to my liking. I'm forced to live by Apple's rules. This is annoying when I know there could be something better and more convenient for me.\n\n‚Ä¢Notification limitations. Inability to change notification sounds in Instagram and Viber.\n\n‚Ä¢Browser limitations. On iPhone, you can't choose which browser to open news from the Google News app, which leads to a lot of ads.\n\nSamsung (Android/One UI): The World I Chose\n\n‚Ä¢Pros (What I'm Fighting For):\n\n‚Ä¢True freedom and customization. The ability to customize everything ‚Äî from the desktop to system functions via Good Lock. It's the feeling that you are the master of your device. It's my own home where I choose the wall color.\n\n‚Ä¢Powerful, ahead-of-its-time innovations. Galaxy AI, enhanced camera capabilities (after configuration), DeX. I feel like I'm using the technologies of the future today.\n\n‚Ä¢Sense of uniqueness. I'm not \"one of the crowd.\" My choice is conscious and differs from the mainstream. This brings a certain intellectual satisfaction.\n\n‚Ä¢Small things that make life easier. A more convenient messenger, a better keyboard, no \"crutches\" for basic things (like listening to music from the browser).\n\n‚Ä¢System openness. The ability to install modded YouTube and YouTube Music apps, which works great.\n\n‚Ä¢Circle to Search. The on-screen search function works great.\n\n‚Ä¢Watch integration. Notifications from my device work on my watch, which was an important factor.\n\n‚Ä¢Step transfer. Steps from the phone are transferred to the watch, allowing me to see full activity statistics.\n\n‚Ä¢Browser control. The ability to uncheck \"open in built-in browser\" for news, which helps avoid ads.\n\n‚Ä¢Cons (The Harsh Truth):\n\n‚Ä¢Freedom requires work. Customization is not only joy but also a necessity. Sometimes this necessity turns into \"repair.\" When I have to fix basic functions (battery, sleep tracking) after an update, it's no longer \"customization\" but fixing manufacturer errors.\n\n‚Ä¢Fragility of innovations. The latest features can be \"raw\" and break. This undermines trust. I expect stability from a flagship but get beta testing for my own money.\n\n‚Ä¢Emotional isolation. The most significant drawback. I fall out of familiar family \"digital rituals.\" This creates a feeling of loneliness and makes me wonder if technological freedom is worth this emotional price.\n\n‚Ä¢Camera quality. Photos come out \"flat,\" without the depth or volume that iPhone has. Videos are also not top-notch. I want the phone to do this for me, not force me to \"play with photos.\" iPhone handles this, even the 13 Pro.\n\n‚Ä¢UI appearance. The iPhone's lock screen looks better.\n\n‚Ä¢Reminders and calendar. Reminder events don't appear in the calendar by default, and while there are workarounds, it feels like a \"crutch.\"\n\n‚Ä¢Weather app. The iPhone's weather app is more detailed; Samsung just redirects to a web page.\n\n‚Ä¢Passwords. The built-in password app doesn't always work on time or connect to save new passwords. I had to install Bitwarden.\n\n‚Ä¢Watch. Although notifications work, auto-tracking for cycling didn't start, and heart rate shows incorrectly during elliptical workouts.\n\n# Part II: The Main Conclusion I Reached\n\nI realized that my choice wasn't between two phones. It was a choice between two life priorities: personal technological freedom and seamless family integration.\n\nI left iPhone because I valued the first. I started to miss it because I underestimated the importance of the second.\n\nThe problem isn't that Samsung is bad and iPhone is good. The problem is that an ideal world where there is both absolute freedom and absolute integration with family on another platform does not exist. And each of us is forced to choose which of these two values is more important to us at a given moment in life.\n\nMy struggle is not an attempt to prove that Samsung is better. It's an attempt to find a way to \"build bridges\" between my new free world and the cozy \"digital home\" where my family remained. And I don't know yet if I will succeed.\n\nMy choice of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was wise, economically justified, and aligns with my desire for innovation and freedom. The only thing I need to do is give myself permission to fully transition to Samsung. Stop comparing and start enjoying my new device. True perfectionism is not demanding an ideal, but achieving maximum comfort with minimal expenditure of resources (time, money, nerves). That's exactly what I did.",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android üëã,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to¬†**WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is¬†**SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\ni wanted to share my experiences regarding my Pixel 8 Pro Video Settings and get your take on them.\n\n1) I prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + FHD+ 30fps + HDR + Active Video Stabilization\" because the video is less pixelated and the zoom produces a clearer image (thanks to video optimization) and the brightness is better (adjusted by AI), which works perfectly for videos in low light conditions (such as walking through a tunnel with light at the end). I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation. Even standard stabilisation copes perfectly well with normal walking.\n\n  \n2) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 30fps + HDR +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because of the benefits of the Video Optimization mentioned above (clearer image).\n\n3) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 60fps + HDR not available +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because the additional 30 fps do not provide any additional benefit, except that the size of the video becomes larger.\n\n  \n",

Only some like chrome can once it detects dual screen, but this is very limited.\n\nI SWEAR the Samsung galaxy fold 7 somehow forces these apps for dual screen, or even have a pop up feature.\n\n  \nNot to mention, even though I got use to the camara on the pixel 10 fold, the pixel 10 pro still outshines it.  At least its better than the Galaxy fold 7, which is why I haven't switched to it.\n\n  \nI know this is android, I know there has to be ways or methods to make it work on this pixel 10 fold.  Otherwise If very limited to one screen on majority of the apps I use, I might as well return it and get a regular pixel or invest in a galaxy fold 7, even with the botched cameras.\n\n  \nAny ideas, or suggestions? Anybody played with developer options and see what it has?\n\n",

Same as last month.\n\nSo for anyone there facing the same, maybe try to delete data from the Google app and let it charge all night to 100%? No clue how might that be related, but it was the only thing I did different from the previous weeks.\n\nI would post a screenshot, but I can't, it is greyed out.",

I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/¬£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

    "title": "1 Month Review of Google Pixel 10 Pro - Disappointing for the price, Don't Buy Yet",
    "selftext": "I Bought this phone for my mother who previously had a Pixel 8. She liked the phone overall and was complaining about the battery and it freezing occasionally. She doesn't use her phone for much besides content and communication, so I thought that and the fact she's already in the ecosystem, I'd by her a 10 Pro. After a month of use we're both going to return the phone and try to buy something like a s25+ or 17 pro. Here's my honest review\n\n**Pros**\n\n* *UI/Software -* Phone feels great to use, UI is responsive and visually appealing. I genuinely think it has the best UI out of any phone currently\n* *Hardware -* Feels premium in the hand, a bit heavy but overall the screen, cameras, buttons, charging, and finger print reader keep up with the other phones of the same price and what I'd expect for paying $1k+\n* *AI -* Didn't use too many of the features since it's not my phone, but when I did use it it was all really impressive. The AI photo tools are surprisingly good and useful, and Gemini is miles ahead of other phones, giving actual response (unlike Apple \"Intelligence\")\n\n**Issues**\n\n* *Battery -* For comparison, I have a 2 year old 15 pro max with 80% battery health, I have on average 2 more hours screen time than her on the pixel, and I occasionally game on the 15 pro max. We'd end the day and I'd have more battery almost always compared to her. You should still be able to get through a day of moderate use with a Pixel, but it's a bit lackluster compared to other phones right now.\n* *Freezing -* My mom would mention an app freezing every other day, and in some cases you'd even have to full restart the phone for the app to work. She uses her phone a lot for work, and when your apps keep crashing it makes the entire experience frustrating. I expect maybe in a few months some updates will fix this issue\n* *Google Apps -* Youtube has a decent amount of issues when it comes to going fullscreen, sometimes freezes. Google Maps was the biggest problem. When using it the location and direction were so inaccurate that it was literally unusable(not exaggerating). I tried debugging both, but they are updated and still have issues. You'd expect Google apps to work on a Google Phone, but they both work better on my Iphone.\n\nOverall I really like the Pixel, and was actually looking to switch my phone over after my current one breaks or gets old, but the issues are too glaring. The last straw happened today, her phone was on the lock screen, but completely frozen, the time and notifications were visible, the fingerprint reader was functional, but as soon as you open the phone you're met with a black screen. A restart fixed the issue, but at this point after a month of complaints I think it will just be best if we replace it with a different phone. I think most of the issues will be fixed eventually with updates, but also keep in mind I spent $1100. I don't see the appeal for wanting the current pixel unless you really love the AI features it has. The pixel is slower, has worse battery life, and has more bugs as compared to other phones its price. If you use your phone primarily for photos/social media and don't use game, I'd say wait a few months for them to update them, otherwise I'd avoid buying this phone. I have high hopes for Pixel, however, and hope they can fix the issues in future generations.\n\nThanks for the read, I'll try to answer any questions",

I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what?

I've tried typing each letter and use autocorrect but jeez how many times do I have to make sure the language is English UK and it still passes English US spelling. How hard is it to remember to use grey, colour, etc??!!\n\nThen there's the gesture types of keyboards. The first one I used you did a loop over a letter you doubled snoop, loop, etc has a squiggle over the letter o. It worked years ago on older phones but it's been going wrong on my last two or three phones.\n\nThen there's the note taking app itself. It's so difficult to put in formatting to highlight say bullet points, underlining or highlighting. I've used basic notes through to onenote, and those competitors like evernote, keep, etc.\n\nSo my question is twofold, what is the best way to put notes down into the memory of your phone via an input method? Secondly, what is a really good and efficient note taking app that allows efficient ways to put thoughts or notes down with formatting to emphasis points as needed? \n\nThe first I am limited by not wanting voice input method. The second is limited by not wanting to spend that much on it. Also, little notebook isn't helpful for me as I want to not carry such things on the off chance I'm going to need it when there's a phone with me all the time. It's a phone based option I need \n\nI hope people have ideas to help me here ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm facing a serious provisioning issue after an *official motherboard replacement* of my **Pixel 9 Pro (Hazel, 512 GB, original SKU: GEC77)**.\n\nMy phone unexpectedly stopped powering on in Sept. Since there‚Äôs no official Google service center in my country, I took it to a **Google-authorized service center in Singapore** during a business trip, where the staff replaced the motherboard.\n\nAfter the repair, I verified that the phone had **two valid IMEIs**, and the system is **Android 14**.\n\nHowever, after returning home and updating to **Android 16**, I suddenly received an email saying that my phone was **blacklisted** after several days of use.\n\nWhen I checked *#06#*, I was shocked to find that both IMEIs were **gone** ‚Äî replaced by a **single IMEI shared by both SIM slots**.\n\nI checked this new IMEI at [imeipro.info](https://www.imeipro.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and it was **indeed blacklisted**, listed as an **old Nokia device**.\n\nIn addition, my Google account now shows this phone as a **Verizon Pixel 9 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB)** and system properties report the **SKU as ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù**\n\nBased on these findings, I believe the **replacement motherboard was never fully provisioned** ‚Äî the IMEIs were *soft-provisioned* during the repair but never *permanently burned* into the protected area. After the Android 16 OTA, a fallback IMEI used, which happens to be part of a **globally blacklisted** IMEI.\n\nI‚Äôm currently living in a country without a Google repair center and can‚Äôt travel again soon.  \nI‚Äôve already contacted Google Support, but they could only suggest visiting an authorized region in person.\n\nüëâ **Request:**  \nPlease escalate this as a *post-repair provisioning defect*.  \nI need confirmation that my case will remain eligible for a **delayed re-provisioning fix** (IMEI re-burn or change a new board) once I‚Äôm able to visit an official repair region.\n\nThanks to anyone from the **Google Repair or Pixel Hardware team** who can help flag this internally.",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. üôÇ",

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

    "selftext": "So, I'm not sure yet, but this might end up being a rent post.\nI switched to Google Pixel about 4 days ago and I've never been happier. My last phone was a Nothing 2a and the ones before that were primary Xiaomi phones. I never had a feeling of finishednes and high quality in my hands before. Although the Chip and the battery aren't the best on a or specifically this foldable, I always wanted one and went all in. I love everything about it and even the noticeable grace of this foldable is rather pleasant to me, I wanted a foldable, I got one, and it only reminds me of the fact that it's foldable.\n\nNow to the rent part of this post, the camera. I'm not a camera guy at all. The years before I didn't even transport or safe my pictures before changing the phone so I lost them every time. It was nothing memorable, just pictures of things to remind me of or something.\nBut with pixel, as it was considered the best phone camera for a long time, I thought, I'd look into it. It looks well done as everything does, but why can't I have the option to just shoot raw in the full, advertised 48mp?\n\nEvery other pixel phone has the option as far as I know and even Gemini told me that it's there, even after the proof of multiple screenshots. It just sounds like a no brainer to just not included the option because, why not.\nI read things online about pixel binging and all the different stuff, but after all, let the people decide what they want after they paid about 1800‚Ç¨ for a brand new phone with the camera of lasts gen, which, btw. had the option to select 48mp raw.\nI won't really need it, it just noticed it and got pissed off, because when I shoot pictures, I also want raw in full quality!\n\nWhy Google, just why? It's such a small thing and yet so dumb!\n\nIf I'm missing something, please correct me!",

It's a long shot, but is there any way that anyone knows of to expand the storage to support a larger Spotify playlist other than buying a newer phone with 1TB storage?

The past two years I switched to the Apple echosystem.. I actually really liked it because it brought me back to the basics and it managed to handle basic task very very very good. Build quality felt amazing and the camera's were amazing. Because of some compatibilty issues with work I had to switch to Android. Again, choosing the Samsung over every other phone because of the looks and performance (on paper). \n\nI realised that the Apple Echosystem is very restrictive so I don't think I will ever switch back to Apple again.\n\nSo here I am... looking into a Pixel because it really gives me Apple vibes, as if Samsung and the iPhone had a baby.\n\nSo, I have a few questions before I consider taking the Pixel (I think I will wait for the Pixel 11):\n\n1. How is the camera? I really like taking Portrait pictures with my phone.  \n2. I had a few moments with the Pixel in a phone store but I couldn't get all out. But it looked to me like as if the widgets were very limited. I normally use the weather widget and the google agenda widget on my homescreen, the google agenda widget on the Samsung shows the full month with the daily tasks on the screen. It didnt look like Pixel has the same widget option. Does anyone know wether this is customizable?  \n3. How is gaming on the Pixel? I sometimes like to play games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves\n\nThank you all",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

    "selftext": "Story time... after a couple of weeks to one month of use, can't recall, I was thinking that the battery for my new Pixel 10 Pro was truly bad. \n\nReading people's options here in reddit was only confirming - \"I was fkd, why the hell did I left my iphone?\" - From 80% at 7 am to 25% at 10 pm, not that much use 2 to 3 hours SOT.\n\n Contacted support, we found out that my Google app  was going wild. Deleted cache and storage. Restarted the phone. Reset voice match. Put it to change no limits, 100% all night. It is 9:40 pm and I still have 74% - 2:10 SOT.Wow! I am not saying that it is out of this world battery life, but the difference is too big! What the hell happened!? \n\nI commute 60 minutes and the phone is connected to the car, but barely charges. Same as last month.\n\nSo for anyone there facing the same, maybe try to delete data from the Google app and let it charge all night to 100%? No clue how might that be related, but it was the only thing I did different from the previous weeks.\n\nI would post a screenshot, but I can't, it is greyed out.",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. üôÇ",

I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation. Even standard stabilisation copes perfectly well with normal walking.\n\n  \n2) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 30fps + HDR +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because of the benefits of the Video Optimization mentioned above (clearer image).\n\n3) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 60fps + HDR not available +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because the additional 30 fps do not provide any additional benefit, except that the size of the video becomes larger.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/¬£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

    "title": "1 Month Review of Google Pixel 10 Pro - Disappointing for the price, Don't Buy Yet",
    "selftext": "I Bought this phone for my mother who previously had a Pixel 8. She liked the phone overall and was complaining about the battery and it freezing occasionally. She doesn't use her phone for much besides content and communication, so I thought that and the fact she's already in the ecosystem, I'd by her a 10 Pro. After a month of use we're both going to return the phone and try to buy something like a s25+ or 17 pro. Here's my honest review\n\n**Pros**\n\n* *UI/Software -* Phone feels great to use, UI is responsive and visually appealing. I genuinely think it has the best UI out of any phone currently\n* *Hardware -* Feels premium in the hand, a bit heavy but overall the screen, cameras, buttons, charging, and finger print reader keep up with the other phones of the same price and what I'd expect for paying $1k+\n* *AI -* Didn't use too many of the features since it's not my phone, but when I did use it it was all really impressive. The AI photo tools are surprisingly good and useful, and Gemini is miles ahead of other phones, giving actual response (unlike Apple \"Intelligence\")\n\n**Issues**\n\n* *Battery -* For comparison, I have a 2 year old 15 pro max with 80% battery health, I have on average 2 more hours screen time than her on the pixel, and I occasionally game on the 15 pro max. We'd end the day and I'd have more battery almost always compared to her. You should still be able to get through a day of moderate use with a Pixel, but it's a bit lackluster compared to other phones right now.\n* *Freezing -* My mom would mention an app freezing every other day, and in some cases you'd even have to full restart the phone for the app to work. She uses her phone a lot for work, and when your apps keep crashing it makes the entire experience frustrating. I expect maybe in a few months some updates will fix this issue\n* *Google Apps -* Youtube has a decent amount of issues when it comes to going fullscreen, sometimes freezes. Google Maps was the biggest problem. When using it the location and direction were so inaccurate that it was literally unusable(not exaggerating). I tried debugging both, but they are updated and still have issues. You'd expect Google apps to work on a Google Phone, but they both work better on my Iphone.\n\nOverall I really like the Pixel, and was actually looking to switch my phone over after my current one breaks or gets old, but the issues are too glaring. The last straw happened today, her phone was on the lock screen, but completely frozen, the time and notifications were visible, the fingerprint reader was functional, but as soon as you open the phone you're met with a black screen. A restart fixed the issue, but at this point after a month of complaints I think it will just be best if we replace it with a different phone. I think most of the issues will be fixed eventually with updates, but also keep in mind I spent $1100. I don't see the appeal for wanting the current pixel unless you really love the AI features it has. The pixel is slower, has worse battery life, and has more bugs as compared to other phones its price. If you use your phone primarily for photos/social media and don't use game, I'd say wait a few months for them to update them, otherwise I'd avoid buying this phone. I have high hopes for Pixel, however, and hope they can fix the issues in future generations.\n\nThanks for the read, I'll try to answer any questions",

On Friday Oct 17, 2025, it was telling me my pin was wrong, which I knew was false, then accepted my fingerprint to unlock. Since it was acting weird about the pin, I had it do a restart. The phone never booted back up. It will not respond to plugging in to a charger. It will not respond to 20+ second presses of the power button or any combination of power+volume up or power+volume down. Google is sending me a replacement but the shipping estimate is 10/24-10/26 with no temporary replacement offered. I told them I would drive to the google store in Santa Monica to get a temporary replacement and they said they would not provide one.",

Only some like chrome can once it detects dual screen, but this is very limited.\n\nI SWEAR the Samsung galaxy fold 7 somehow forces these apps for dual screen, or even have a pop up feature.\n\n  \nNot to mention, even though I got use to the camara on the pixel 10 fold, the pixel 10 pro still outshines it.  At least its better than the Galaxy fold 7, which is why I haven't switched to it.\n\n  \nI know this is android, I know there has to be ways or methods to make it work on this pixel 10 fold.  Otherwise If very limited to one screen on majority of the apps I use, I might as well return it and get a regular pixel or invest in a galaxy fold 7, even with the botched cameras.\n\n  \nAny ideas, or suggestions? Anybody played with developer options and see what it has?\n\n",

I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

So, I though maybe the screen protector i replaced yesterday wasn't sitting right. I took it off. Ten minutes later, the screen goes green, static, three dead pixels up top center. Flickering on and off. I start reading up on 8 and 8a screen issues. Several minutes later, it's now just totally dead, though the phone is responsive. I'm just under 18 months in, so no warranty. This phone was flawless up until this moment. Best part is I'm  across the pond in London until Thursday afternoon. ",

I used to use custom launchers back in the day but they seem more finicky and glitchy with newer phones. I loved Android because I could customize everything to fit my personality and now they're making us like Apple. It feels like the same pull to minimalism and sad beige aesthetic that is plaguing homes and businesses (looking at you McDonald's and Taco Bell) now a days. All personality is being sucked out. I want choices without needing a custom launcher. ",

Since there‚Äôs no official Google service center in my country, I took it to a **Google-authorized service center in Singapore** during a business trip, where the staff replaced the motherboard.\n\nAfter the repair, I verified that the phone had **two valid IMEIs**, and the system is **Android 14**.\n\nHowever, after returning home and updating to **Android 16**, I suddenly received an email saying that my phone was **blacklisted** after several days of use.\n\nWhen I checked *#06#*, I was shocked to find that both IMEIs were **gone** ‚Äî replaced by a **single IMEI shared by both SIM slots**.\n\nI checked this new IMEI at [imeipro.info](https://www.imeipro.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and it was **indeed blacklisted**, listed as an **old Nokia device**.\n\nIn addition, my Google account now shows this phone as a **Verizon Pixel 9 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB)** and system properties report the **SKU as ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù**\n\nBased on these findings, I believe the **replacement motherboard was never fully provisioned** ‚Äî the IMEIs were *soft-provisioned* during the repair but never *permanently burned* into the protected area.

However this is not always available to me so I have to use my phone. Never satisfying as it never works as well as I need it to. \n\nNow I've had the Swype keyboards from earliest days on my Samsung galaxy s2 though various android phones too my P9 now. It got ok but then kind of lost the plot.\n\n I've tried the Google gesture typing. I've tried typing each letter and use autocorrect but jeez how many times do I have to make sure the language is English UK and it still passes English US spelling. How hard is it to remember to use grey, colour, etc??!!\n\nThen there's the gesture types of keyboards. The first one I used you did a loop over a letter you doubled snoop, loop, etc has a squiggle over the letter o. It worked years ago on older phones but it's been going wrong on my last two or three phones.\n\nThen there's the note taking app itself. It's so difficult to put in formatting to highlight say bullet points, underlining or highlighting. I've used basic notes through to onenote, and those competitors like evernote, keep, etc.\n\nSo my question is twofold, what is the best way to put notes down into the memory of your phone via an input method? Secondly, what is a really good and efficient note taking app that allows efficient ways to put thoughts or notes down with formatting to emphasis points as needed? \n\nThe first I am limited by not wanting voice input method. The second is limited by not wanting to spend that much on it. Also, little notebook isn't helpful for me as I want to not carry such things on the off chance I'm going to need it when there's a phone with me all the time. It's a phone based option I need \n\nI hope people have ideas to help me here ",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this!

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\ni wanted to share my experiences regarding my Pixel 8 Pro Video Settings and get your take on them.\n\n1) I prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + FHD+ 30fps + HDR + Active Video Stabilization\" because the video is less pixelated and the zoom produces a clearer image (thanks to video optimization) and the brightness is better (adjusted by AI), which works perfectly for videos in low light conditions (such as walking through a tunnel with light at the end). I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation. Even standard stabilisation copes perfectly well with normal walking.\n\n  \n2) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 30fps + HDR +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because of the benefits of the Video Optimization mentioned above (clearer image).\n\n3) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 60fps + HDR not available +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because the additional 30 fps do not provide any additional benefit, except that the size of the video becomes larger.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/¬£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what? I finally got a response and they are having me pay for shipping the case back with me just putting a return number in the package. There's not real official return process outside of that \n\nTLDR: The Ghostek Pixel 10 Pro Fold case is a scam and doesn't work with PixelSnap.",

    "title": "1 Month Review of Google Pixel 10 Pro - Disappointing for the price, Don't Buy Yet",
    "selftext": "I Bought this phone for my mother who previously had a Pixel 8. She liked the phone overall and was complaining about the battery and it freezing occasionally. She doesn't use her phone for much besides content and communication, so I thought that and the fact she's already in the ecosystem, I'd by her a 10 Pro. After a month of use we're both going to return the phone and try to buy something like a s25+ or 17 pro. Here's my honest review\n\n**Pros**\n\n* *UI/Software -* Phone feels great to use, UI is responsive and visually appealing. I genuinely think it has the best UI out of any phone currently\n* *Hardware -* Feels premium in the hand, a bit heavy but overall the screen, cameras, buttons, charging, and finger print reader keep up with the other phones of the same price and what I'd expect for paying $1k+\n* *AI -* Didn't use too many of the features since it's not my phone, but when I did use it it was all really impressive. The AI photo tools are surprisingly good and useful, and Gemini is miles ahead of other phones, giving actual response (unlike Apple \"Intelligence\")\n\n**Issues**\n\n* *Battery -* For comparison, I have a 2 year old 15 pro max with 80% battery health, I have on average 2 more hours screen time than her on the pixel, and I occasionally game on the 15 pro max. We'd end the day and I'd have more battery almost always compared to her. You should still be able to get through a day of moderate use with a Pixel, but it's a bit lackluster compared to other phones right now.\n* *Freezing -* My mom would mention an app freezing every other day, and in some cases you'd even have to full restart the phone for the app to work. She uses her phone a lot for work, and when your apps keep crashing it makes the entire experience frustrating. I expect maybe in a few months some updates will fix this issue\n* *Google Apps -* Youtube has a decent amount of issues when it comes to going fullscreen, sometimes freezes. Google Maps was the biggest problem. When using it the location and direction were so inaccurate that it was literally unusable(not exaggerating). I tried debugging both, but they are updated and still have issues. You'd expect Google apps to work on a Google Phone, but they both work better on my Iphone.\n\nOverall I really like the Pixel, and was actually looking to switch my phone over after my current one breaks or gets old, but the issues are too glaring. The last straw happened today, her phone was on the lock screen, but completely frozen, the time and notifications were visible, the fingerprint reader was functional, but as soon as you open the phone you're met with a black screen. A restart fixed the issue, but at this point after a month of complaints I think it will just be best if we replace it with a different phone. I think most of the issues will be fixed eventually with updates, but also keep in mind I spent $1100. I don't see the appeal for wanting the current pixel unless you really love the AI features it has. The pixel is slower, has worse battery life, and has more bugs as compared to other phones its price. If you use your phone primarily for photos/social media and don't use game, I'd say wait a few months for them to update them, otherwise I'd avoid buying this phone. I have high hopes for Pixel, however, and hope they can fix the issues in future generations.\n\nThanks for the read, I'll try to answer any questions",

Only some like chrome can once it detects dual screen, but this is very limited.\n\nI SWEAR the Samsung galaxy fold 7 somehow forces these apps for dual screen, or even have a pop up feature.\n\n  \nNot to mention, even though I got use to the camara on the pixel 10 fold, the pixel 10 pro still outshines it.  At least its better than the Galaxy fold 7, which is why I haven't switched to it.\n\n  \nI know this is android, I know there has to be ways or methods to make it work on this pixel 10 fold.  Otherwise If very limited to one screen on majority of the apps I use, I might as well return it and get a regular pixel or invest in a galaxy fold 7, even with the botched cameras.\n\n  \nAny ideas, or suggestions?

I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

And let me know if NFL+ plays smooth on yours if it works! Thanks!",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I‚Äôm there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I‚Äôve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Btw the objective was to see which Magic Eraser works better. Although Samsungs eraser was sooo much better... but on a different picture. Because my camera couldn't capture one vehicle in the background clearly.\n\nI do have Quick Tap Shutter on and Prioritize Focus over speed off. I thought Samsung could do better because it's pretty much iPhone 15 or 16 equivalent. Idk I thought camera was kinda close to iPhone but phone camers, i think iPhone wins hands down.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Just got my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic today, and sort of a mixed bag, but overall I'm happy and will be switching the wife to the smaller version.  Speaking of size . . ..\n\nFirst the size isn't all that much bigger than the PW1 with a Spigen case.  I'm not seeing the Samsung needing a case since the glass does not stick out like the Pixels do.  I was worried about size because I don't have the largest wrists, but not a problem with this watch.\n\nSecond, the setup app worked incredibly well!  It even logged into T-Mobile and set up the LTE sim.  I did unlock the PW1 \"sim protection\" in the T-Mobile website first, as a precaution.  But I was expecting more hassle.\n\nThird, I now remember why I gave the wife's earlier Samsung watch to our grown out of the house daughter and bought the wife a Pixel watch.  Navigating with the buttons and such is a PITA on the Samsung.  Amazing two brands based on the same software can be so different.  And the choices you can set for what the buttons do which thing are very limited.  Fortunately between Bixby and Gemini I can give voice commands, and one button can be set to recently opened apps.\n\nFourth, I was glad to see the Air Quality Complication works on Samsung, because I have an air quality monitor on my house.  Took a few tries to get it to work though because \"precise\" location didn't work, I needed to select when using the app.\n\nFifth, a bit disappointed with the limited face choices and also the focus on Samsung Health.  On that note though the EKG seems to work much better on Samsung.\n\nSixth, I like the ability to limit battery charge.  I've been setting a timer to avoid charging the PW1 to 100%.\n\nStill haven't tried a few things, like connecting my hearing aid to the watch's BT.  Not possible with my device on Pixel.  And went on a walk before this arrived, so not much info on heartbeat and steps.\n\nOverall I'm happy and look forward to having this watch until its security updates run out.\n\nEdit:  I've found that if I have a question regarding setup that Gemini is much better than ChatGPT, which is really, really bad for some reason.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

In either case, I can't see from the watch what just alerted - I have to check the phone.\n\nI don't have any modes (such as Sleep) enabled. I only had the knock-knock gesture to access Gemini, but I've since turned all gestures off and it keeps happening.\n\nI don't know what else to look for. Any advice? TIA!",

    "title": "Pairing galaxy watch with xiaomi China rom",
    "selftext": "I recently bought a new Xiaomi 17 Pro Max (without any options, it's a China ROM) and I am the owner of a global version Galaxy Watch 6. The question arose of how to connect them to the phone, since the standard connection via the Galaxy Wearable app from the Google Play Market didn't work. I kept getting an error that the connection failed or that the phone was not supported. So, for people like me, I'm writing this guide, since I managed to do it, and I haven't found another guide like this on the internet. (At any stage, you may encounter difficulties with permission to install applications, but I hope you can handle this yourself <3 )  \n1. This is probably optional, I haven't tested without this step: Resets the watch settings;  \n2. You need to download the Tencent App Store;  \n3. Next, download the following applications from the Tencent App Store: Galaxy Wearable and Wear OS by Google;  \n4. Download the required version of the galaxy plugin from the Play Market: for me it was Galaxy Watch6 plugin.  \n5. Go to the settings of all 3 applications and set them to autostart in the battery settings \"No restrictions\", and in the permissions settings you can give all access. I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but \"Acess list of installed apps\" and \"Open new window shile running in the background\" it was enough if someone doesn‚Äôt want to give everything;  \n6. Go to Bluetooth settings and connect the watch;  \n7. In Wear OS, you should see two buttons. One for Wear OS watch, And the second one with text \"Have a Samsung watch?\" with a button \"Open Galaxy Wearable\" <- you need this button. Galaxy Wearable should open and show your Bluetooth connected watch. Start connecting.  \n8. **SKIP ALL THE STEPS OF LOGGING INTO YOUR SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE ACCOUNTS!!**! You can do it later.  \nP.S. Sometimes, during the setup process, everything might break at some percentage. Don't panic, and try again. I usually get it right on the second try.",

    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

Sure enough, I call again, some support person tells me that I will be contacted within 24 - 72 hours by someone to discuss my options. Long story short, i receive an email today, pretty vague, saying that the watch is not repairable, so they will refund my purchase. I have a Fit 3, but i really got used to all the premium features of the Ultra and the relatively decent battery life. A new 2025 Ultra is almost $700 with tax. I have no idea what was wrong with my watch and now I'm terrified that it might happen again.\n\n  \nUpdate: Samsung has reached out to me and they will be providing me with a coupon that should cover cost of a new Ultra watch 2025.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I‚Äôm u/Alan-Foster, one of the moderators of r/GalaxyWatch. We recently passed over 200,000 members! The other 2 moderators have been inactive for a few months, so I‚Äôve taken over the role as top moderator for the community. I‚Äôve been doing some spring cleaning and updates, with the biggest changes being:\n\n\n\n* The rules list is much clearer and more detailed\n* The rule on Watch Face Posts is now:\n   * Pictures of real watches are allowed, but advertisements are not.\n   * See the included image as an example\n\n\n\nSome other smaller changes:\n\n\n\n* More ‚ÄúSimilar Communities‚Äù subreddits are on the sidebar\n* Flairs have been cleaned up slightly and might be combined in the future.\n* The backlog of unprocessed rule violation reports has been actioned and cleared\n   * If your post or comment was accidentally removed, let me know!\n* A comment sticky has been created clarifying the new Watch Face Post rule\n\n\n\nWe will be doing a call for moderators in the future. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\nDo you have any feedback or requests you‚Äôd like to share about the state of the subreddit? Please let me know!\n\n",

With the calls, it's just muting the ringer, I can still answer on my phone. But with the alarms, I can't interact with them on my phone - I have to go see what was snoozed in the notifications. In either case, I can't see from the watch what just alerted - I have to check the phone.\n\nI don't have any modes (such as Sleep) enabled. I only had the knock-knock gesture to access Gemini, but I've since turned all gestures off and it keeps happening.\n\nI don't know what else to look for. Any advice? TIA!",

    "title": "Pairing galaxy watch with xiaomi China rom",
    "selftext": "I recently bought a new Xiaomi 17 Pro Max (without any options, it's a China ROM) and I am the owner of a global version Galaxy Watch 6. The question arose of how to connect them to the phone, since the standard connection via the Galaxy Wearable app from the Google Play Market didn't work. I kept getting an error that the connection failed or that the phone was not supported. So, for people like me, I'm writing this guide, since I managed to do it, and I haven't found another guide like this on the internet. (At any stage, you may encounter difficulties with permission to install applications, but I hope you can handle this yourself <3 )  \n1. This is probably optional, I haven't tested without this step: Resets the watch settings;  \n2. You need to download the Tencent App Store;  \n3. Next, download the following applications from the Tencent App Store: Galaxy Wearable and Wear OS by Google;  \n4. Download the required version of the galaxy plugin from the Play Market: for me it was Galaxy Watch6 plugin.  \n5. Go to the settings of all 3 applications and set them to autostart in the battery settings \"No restrictions\", and in the permissions settings you can give all access. I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but \"Acess list of installed apps\" and \"Open new window shile running in the background\" it was enough if someone doesn‚Äôt want to give everything;  \n6. Go to Bluetooth settings and connect the watch;  \n7. In Wear OS, you should see two buttons. One for Wear OS watch, And the second one with text \"Have a Samsung watch?\" with a button \"Open Galaxy Wearable\" <- you need this button. Galaxy Wearable should open and show your Bluetooth connected watch. Start connecting.  \n8. **SKIP ALL THE STEPS OF LOGGING INTO YOUR SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE ACCOUNTS!!**! You can do it later.  \nP.S. Sometimes, during the setup process, everything might break at some percentage. Don't panic, and try again. I usually get it right on the second try.",

    "selftext": "It just started yesterday, mid-day, without making any changes to the settings of my watch or phone.\n\nAll alarms are snoozed in a couple of seconds, and phone calls are ignored  just as quick. With the calls, it's just muting the ringer, I can still answer on my phone. But with the alarms, I can't interact with them on my phone - I have to go see what was snoozed in the notifications. In either case, I can't see from the watch what just alerted - I have to check the phone.\n\nI don't have any modes (such as Sleep) enabled. I only had the knock-knock gesture to access Gemini, but I've since turned all gestures off and it keeps happening.\n\nI don't know what else to look for. Any advice? TIA!",

Will this setup still work on the MacBook?\n\nPlease note: I'm not very techie.

Should I aim for a used laptop which passed MIL-STD 810H or similar mil-spec tests, meaning that normal use would be a breeze for it and hence possibly last longer and being more likely to have survived past owner's non-visible misuse?\n\n2. If CPU performances are similar, should I aim for a laptop which is 2 generations newer, just for the sake of it having likely more time ahead?\n\n3. Should I aim for a model which can support the highest amount of RAM, so that I can max out the RAM to postpone as late as possible the day when it will be too obsolete?\n\n4. Are there any hidden physical or software trackers I should be wary of that cannot be removed by formatting, if buying a used laptop?\n\nThanks for your help",

There is no way, that i see, to edit what is being saved. This seems ridiculous and honestly like a marketing ploy to purposely take up storage forcing you to buy more.\n* I added up all the values for \"installed apps\" and it only comes to 1.063 GB ... not 28.4\n* There's literally nothing else on the computer besides what comes preprogrammed/installed.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI‚Äôve been troubleshooting my HP Omen 17-cb0040nr (2019, i7-9750H + RTX 2070 + 144 Hz G-Sync panel) for years, and it‚Äôs finally reaching a weird, half-alive state. Here‚Äôs the full story in chronological order.\n\nüïê 2019 ‚Äì Early 2020\n\nLaptop worked great for the first ~6 months.\n\nHeavy gaming (Apex Legends, etc.) pushed GPU temps to 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C.\n\nThe display would suddenly go black, sound would freeze, and I had to force shutdown.\n\nAfter cooling down, it would boot normally again.\n\nLag when plugged in: Occasionally, since purchase, performance would drop badly until I unplugged and re-plugged the charger, then FPS would instantly recover.\n\nüßπ Mid 2020 ‚Äì 2021\n\nFound dust clogging the cooling system; cleaned it thoroughly.\n\nTemps improved and random shutdowns reduced.\n\nAround 2021, HP UEFI Diagnostics flagged a ‚ÄúVideo Memory [F] failure‚Äù ‚Üí confirmed early VRAM instability on the GPU.\n\nFrom this point onward, the GPU remained functional but unstable under high load.\n\n‚ö° 2022 ‚Äì 2024\n\nContinued gaming on medium settings; GPU stayed below 78 ¬∞C.\n\nOccasional driver crashes or screen flickers.\n\nNo major shutdowns, but instability kept creeping back.\n\nüîã 2025\n\nHP Smart reported a ‚Äúblown charge-state fuse‚Äù ‚Äî battery stopped charging completely. Removed the battery since this. I get CMOS error and I press enter to see boot (hp omen logo).\n\nBegan using the laptop plugged in only, like a desktop.\n\nThe power button started blinking continuously even during normal operation ‚Üí likely due to the battery-circuit fault.\n\nSystem still booted and worked fine on AC.\n\nüí• Current State (2025 October)\n\nThe internal laptop display stays black most of the time (backlight faintly glows).\n\nExternal 200 Hz monitor (HDMI) works well ‚Äî I can even play Apex Legends for hours on medium settings with GPU VRAM capped to 4 GB.\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel won‚Äôt open, though the RTX 2070 is visible in Device Manager and Task Manager.\n\nBoot behavior:\n\nExternal monitor connected via HDMI.\n\nPress power ‚Üí CMOS error occurs(sometimes it wont be displayed in either of the displays, occurs when I start the laptop after a long time, like half a day etc) (I press enter to proceed with booting, as one can see if windows is booted or not by pressing caps lock to see if the button lights are working or not) \n\nWhat happens next in a successful boot is, the powee button light goes off and turns on in like 2 sec, I press entee agan and the same cycle happens for one more time (2 to 3 timez at max), and then the external display connected (sometimes internal display too) gets hp omen logo boot screen. Post this, if windows login acreen comes, in atleast one of the displays, it is a successful boot. Else, I have to force shutdown the pc and start again\n\nSystem reboots itself once or twice.\n\nHP Omen logo appears ‚Äî almost always on the external monitor.\n\nDisplay outcomes (approx. 10 boots):\n\n5 times ‚Üí only external monitor shows the Windows login screen, laptop panel stays blank.\n\n1 time ‚Üí both monitors work correctly and internal 144 Hz panel shows Windows login.\n\n4 times ‚Üí internal panel = black, external = HP logo only (no Windows output). I can still log in blindly and shut down via Alt + F4, so the system is running headless.\n\nWhen I try to ‚ÄúDuplicate display,‚Äù both displays drop to 1024√ó768 @ 60 Hz, the only modes Windows detects for the laptop screen.\n\nüîé Current Symptoms Summary\n\nGPU and HDMI output work reliably; internal panel almost dead.\n\nCMOS error on every cold boot ‚Üí BIOS resets device detection.\n\nHP Diagnostics previously confirmed Video Memory failure.\n\nüí≠ My Suspicions\n\nPartial GPU VRAM degradation or faulty eDP (output to internal panel).\n\nPossible loose or damaged eDP cable/panel connector.\n\nWeak CMOS battery causing repeated re-detection and boot loops.\n\nBattery-charging fuse blown (confirmed), forcing AC-only operation.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What Still Works\n\nExternal monitor gaming at 200 Hz for hours.\n\nAll USB, audio, and Ethernet functions.\n\nInternal panel sometimes returns to life for one boot, then fails again.\n\n‚ùìLooking for Advice\n\nHas anyone seen an RTX-series GPU that works fine externally but fails internally?\n\nCould a failing VRAM or eDP transmitter cause intermittent CMOS errors?\n\nIs a GPU reball worth it on this board (L50873-006), or should I hunt for a replacement motherboard?\n\nAny way to disable the internal panel entirely to speed up boot?\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would really help.\nThanks for reading ‚Äî posting this so future Omen owners facing half-dead GPUs can find a full timeline too.",

I have an Android phone.\n* I store my files on both Google Drive and OneDrive (and don't really store things locally, but I use the sync apps).\n\nI'm drawn to the MacBook Air due to it's battery life and reliability. But I'm drawn to the Surface due to it's familiarity and customisability. There are a few Windows features I use regularly, and I don't know if I could give them up:\n\n* Ability to copy and paste file paths in Explorer.\n* Snipping Tool.\n* The task bar (each window having it's own icon, being able to hover over the icons and see previews).\n* Easily snapping windows on the screen using keyboard shortcuts.\n* Centre clicking the scroll wheel to close tabs/open links.\n\n**So, what do you think? I'm thinking Surface Laptop, but I'm worried about longevity (mostly battery life).**\n\nThankyou!",

After I gave it to the repair shop they started taking too long and when I asked for updates they said they needed to import some pieces and that's what was taking too long. Unbeknownst to me during these weeks they went on a minor holiday, despite the fact I told them I had a thesis to write and that in the meantime they could give me back my laptop temporarily. Fed up with the waiting, I demanded that to be returned, only for them to disassemble it the same morning I came back to take it and asking me for one more day. After one day I took it back and now it doesn't start anymore, the BIOS doesn't start, and Windows recovery USB doesn't work either. I looked inside but nothing has been stolen. What could have they done with it?(They asked for my password) How can I at least salvage the situation?",

On top of that, I'm getting an issue commonly experienced when HDR is, in fact, on; my cursor is overexposed (washed out, light colors), except when dragging windows. First I thought it was Nvidia's fault since it only occurred when I was on the NVIDIA GPU only display mode, but after another restart it started happening when I'm on Optimus as well...\n\nThis led me to think that something is tricking my system into thinking it's using HDR, but I can't for the life of me figure out what that something is. I've checked everything that comes to mind, both Nvidia's settings and my Windows settings. In Windows settings it is clearly stated that only HDR Video is supported, but \"Use HDR\" isn't. In the Nvidia settings the only HDR-related setting that I can find is HDR under RTX Video Enhancement, but whether I turn it on or off does not make any difference.\n\nIf anyone knows how to handle this, I'd be pleased to receive feedback.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\nI‚Äôm planning to buy a laptop for my dad and I‚Äôm a bit confused about what to get. His main requirements are a lightweight laptop with good battery life, capable of video editing, a premium feel, and a high-quality display. He‚Äôs a professor, so things like making presentations and other academic tasks are important as well.\n\nMy budget is around $1,000, and I‚Äôm currently torn between the MacBook Air M3 (16GB/512GB) and the Asus Zenbook OLED. The Zenbook lineup has many variants. I really liked the A14, but it‚Äôs quite expensive and comes with the Snapdragon X Elite chip, which isn‚Äôt compatible with Premiere Pro. There are also other variants with Intel Core Ultra processors, but I‚Äôve heard they tend to overheat, and I‚Äôm unsure how they perform.\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm leaning towards the MacBook since I use one myself and would like to gradually get him into the Apple ecosystem. However, he‚Äôs been using Windows for years, so switching to macOS might be a bit challenging for him. Unfortunately, none of the Windows laptops seem to offer the same premium experience as the MacBook at this price range.\n\nI really want to get the best option for him, but I‚Äôm so confused about what to choose. Please let me know what you think I should go for between these two, or if there are any other good alternatives you‚Äôd recommend.\n\nThank you!",

It was constant pain. It's got lots of great memories but I think I have to let go already. But to let go means to get a new one. The problem is: I don't have money. To be in a country like mine and being a broke teenager, it's almost impossible to save up money fast enough to still get my school work done. Right now I'm mostly borrowing my mother's laptop and it's just not consistent because she needs it for her work too and our schedule lines up and I end up never being able to use it. Anyways my whish for this Christmas is a new laptop so I could do my school work and possibly have an online job.",

I played this game as a kid on a laptop much older and much worse than the one i have now.\n\nWhat's causing my confusion/frustration:\n\n* The system shows the game is using 0 storage? which obviously cannot be true.\n   * It should only be taking up 15-20gb ish according the the game site.\n* \"System & Reserve\" is taking up literally have of the disc drive, while it is currently telling me it needs to install more updates.  There is no way, that i see, to edit what is being saved. This seems ridiculous and honestly like a marketing ploy to purposely take up storage forcing you to buy more.\n* I added up all the values for \"installed apps\" and it only comes to 1.063 GB ... not 28.4\n* There's literally nothing else on the computer besides what comes preprogrammed/installed. No files, no pictures, recycle bin empty, no audio.

Should I aim for a used laptop which passed MIL-STD 810H or similar mil-spec tests, meaning that normal use would be a breeze for it and hence possibly last longer and being more likely to have survived past owner's non-visible misuse?\n\n2. If CPU performances are similar, should I aim for a laptop which is 2 generations newer, just for the sake of it having likely more time ahead?\n\n3. Should I aim for a model which can support the highest amount of RAM, so that I can max out the RAM to postpone as late as possible the day when it will be too obsolete?\n\n4. Are there any hidden physical or software trackers I should be wary of that cannot be removed by formatting, if buying a used laptop?\n\nThanks for your help",

Will this setup still work on the MacBook?\n\nPlease note: I'm not very techie. I only do basic Virtual Assistant work -- mostly Google Chrome (many tabs open), Teams app, Google Docs/Sheets, MS tools, RingCentral and a time tracker.\n\n\n\nI would also appreciate it if you could share tips or suggestions to improve my setup so I can finally buy a MacBook.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hi there. Here's a preface before I use the suggestion form; my laptop's screen just shorted on the board but it works well with external monitors. I bring my laptop around for school and I use it at home. Most attachable external monitors I've found go to the side or above the main monitor, but I'd like to use one that goes over the top of my main monitor so I can ignore the dead one and not have to look in any awkward direction. I have an ASUS ROG Strix (G15, IIRC).\nSee rough illustration for what I'm looking for in a visual sense, as I'm worried I'm not explaining it well.\n\n\n\n    Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:\n\n    Purchasing in US, would like to spend under 200 dollars. Preferably in the 80-150 range.\n\n    Are you open to refurbs/used?\n\n    If necessary.\n\n    How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?\n\n    N/A\n\n    How important is weight and thinness to you?\n\n    I'd prefer something thin so I can fit it in my backpack with my laptop.\n\n    Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\n\n     I believe my screen's size is 15.6 in? It could be 16. I need to check.\n\n    Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\n\n    I often draw on Krita with an external tablet and would enjoy if I could use multiple external displays at once with it. I sometimes use my All-in-one USB-C for my drawing tablet, but I'm willing to use my HDMI and power cords for it instead if it comes to that, since I usually use that one at home anyways. I'd like the option to use both HMDI + a power cable and the option to use an all-in-one USB-C, if possible.\n\n    If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\n\n    -fill here, remove dashes-\n\n    Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\n\n    Needs to overlap the screen, preferably be durable, and it'd be nice if I could clip it so it stays firm?\n\n    Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\n\n    N/A, thank you so much for reading and taking the time to suggest!\n",

I have an Android phone.\n* I store my files on both Google Drive and OneDrive (and don't really store things locally, but I use the sync apps).\n\nI'm drawn to the MacBook Air due to it's battery life and reliability. But I'm drawn to the Surface due to it's familiarity and customisability. There are a few Windows features I use regularly, and I don't know if I could give them up:\n\n* Ability to copy and paste file paths in Explorer.\n* Snipping Tool.\n* The task bar (each window having it's own icon, being able to hover over the icons and see previews).\n* Easily snapping windows on the screen using keyboard shortcuts.\n* Centre clicking the scroll wheel to close tabs/open links.\n\n**So, what do you think? I'm thinking Surface Laptop, but I'm worried about longevity (mostly battery life).**\n\nThankyou!",

It was constant pain. It's got lots of great memories but I think I have to let go already. But to let go means to get a new one. The problem is: I don't have money. To be in a country like mine and being a broke teenager, it's almost impossible to save up money fast enough to still get my school work done. Right now I'm mostly borrowing my mother's laptop and it's just not consistent because she needs it for her work too and our schedule lines up and I end up never being able to use it.

    "selftext": "I consider myself pretty tech savvy and this is putting me at a lost for words. My storage/disc drive is CONSTANTLY telling me its full... when there's literally barely anything on my laptop. I use it occasionally for work stuff, but primarly to play an online game (Wiz101 show in pic #4). While the game does use a lot of storage, i know it should not be taking up all of my storage. I played this game as a kid on a laptop much older and much worse than the one i have now.\n\nWhat's causing my confusion/frustration:\n\n* The system shows the game is using 0 storage? which obviously cannot be true.\n   * It should only be taking up 15-20gb ish according the the game site.\n* \"System & Reserve\" is taking up literally have of the disc drive, while it is currently telling me it needs to install more updates.  There is no way, that i see, to edit what is being saved. This seems ridiculous and honestly like a marketing ploy to purposely take up storage forcing you to buy more.\n* I added up all the values for \"installed apps\" and it only comes to 1.063 GB ... not 28.4\n* There's literally nothing else on the computer besides what comes preprogrammed/installed. No files, no pictures, recycle bin empty, no audio. Literally just the game and windows system files.\n\nI have tried:\n\n* Running through the game log and clearing temp files and unneeded files.\n* Running Disc Cleanup\n\nnot sure what else to do and i don't currently have an external storage device to use.",

Should I aim for a used laptop which passed MIL-STD 810H or similar mil-spec tests, meaning that normal use would be a breeze for it and hence possibly last longer and being more likely to have survived past owner's non-visible misuse?\n\n2. If CPU performances are similar, should I aim for a laptop which is 2 generations newer, just for the sake of it having likely more time ahead?\n\n3. Should I aim for a model which can support the highest amount of RAM, so that I can max out the RAM to postpone as late as possible the day when it will be too obsolete?\n\n4. Are there any hidden physical or software trackers I should be wary of that cannot be removed by formatting, if buying a used laptop?\n\nThanks for your help",

I don't need the new laptop to do anything crazy, any sort of simulation programs or whatever will probably be run on school hardware, but I do need something better.\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $1200 USD\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Preferably it would be new\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** A 14.5\" screen or less is HIGHLY preferred. Needs to have good build quality, and good enough performance. \n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Super important. The thinner the better. Its gonna be in my backpack lol. \n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14.5\" or less. Less is preferred.\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** No not really.\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** As long as the build is good quality im happy\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** I will probably hold off until black friday to make any purchases (its only like a month away) but I am just trying to find what I would get. Thanks!\n\nI was thinking a macbook air since they have an education discount, but ive always been a windows guy and I honestly dont feel like dealing with not being able to run some things just because I have a mac. So preferably a windows computer. Any help would be appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys,  \nI'm thinking of building my third PC rig. I've had some low-end builds in the past, but this time I want to go a bit more all-out (without completely breaking the bank). I've spent a few hours researching and putting this parts list together, and I'm pretty happy with it but I wanted to see what you guys thought of it and if you had any suggestions?  \nI wanted to go for the Fractal Terra case because I use a Mac mini as my main work machine and like the super small aesthetic, but I feel like a slightly larger case (and mATX motherboard/other components) would help with upfront costs (no ITX tax), and let me upgrade further without getting an entirely new case.  \n  \nParts Rationale:\n\n* Ryzen 5 9600X - Likely don't need the Ryzen 7 series since this is a gaming-focused machine, and just that. The savings here let me buy a better GPU! I've considered the X3D but I'm aiming for 1440p/4K gaming and I hear the X3D doesn't really provide any meaningful benefit at these resolutions (though I'm happy to be proven wrong!)\n* Crucial Pro 2x16GB - A happy 32GB to start off with. IF things get more demanding, I can always throw another stick or two into the system for 48/64GB\n* WD Black SN7100 512GB/4TGB - For the boot drive and for the games drive respectively. PCIe gen 5 doesn't seem to be anything too crazy, probably not something I'd notice or benefit from. I hear these are fast and reliable drives, and the 4TB means I hopefully wouldn't need to uninstall games too often (though the motherboard has 3 NVMe slots, so worst case I can throw another one in)\n* RX 9070XT - Performs a lot better than the 7700XT from what I've heard, plus I value the ability to use RT if I want to, plus FSR4 support\n\nThe build will be running a flavour of Linux setup to essentially emulate the Steam Deck. Boot straight into the Deck UI (with the option to exit to the KDE Desktop), HDMI-CEC to turn on the TV when the PC turns on/wakes from sleep, 2.4GHz dongle for my controllers to wake from sleep, etc. I essentially want to build a console, which is a super exciting idea for me.\n\nIm open to any suggestions, as I really want to make this **THE** PC build and not unintentionally waste money on parts I could've saved on and then put money towards other parts.\n\n  \n[https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/TTmZVF](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/TTmZVF)",

I am upgrading my PC right now, I already own the case and right now I have a I5 9600k and a 2060 super as well as 16GB DDR4 2133MT/s RAM.\n\nFirst of all, do you think the CPU + Cooler + Motherboard setup is fine, or should anything be changed? Also I'm 99% that it does but if not pls can someone tell me if the cooler doesn't fit into my case?\n\nSecondly, I wont upgrade everything at the same time (the gpu later) does my 2060 super still work fine with everything new except for the graphics card? Or are there some compatability issues.\n\nLastly I really want a new SSD, and I thought 2TB would be more appropriate for gaming especially with these huge games sizes nowadays. Since I don't have unlimited money, I would upgrade my RAM sometime in the future and not right now, is this a problem? Or should I change my priorities to by the RAM now? Also is this a good SSD or would you recommend something else?\n\nINFO: I play every game at 4k since both my screen are in 4k\n\nBonus? How much wattage would my power supply need, I think something like 750W right? Is 600W also fine or is it worth buying the one with higher Wattage?",

    "selftext": "Hi, i'm back with my temperature issues and at this point I am not sure what I am doing wrong.\n\nI've been upgrading/building my PCs and for others for past 10+ years, but I am really not an expert, first builds were with cheap MBs to save a buck and I didn't know anything about ram speeds or that PSU did matter and I haven't seen a problem like this before, but that's not the point.\n\nMy **13700k** is HOT, google say it's ok, but I've seen people doing much better, so I need an advice or just vent a bit.\n\nLet's start with my system.\n\nI have very spacious Lian Li O11D evo Case with 10 Fans (3 Lian li reverse lcd for drip and 7 high be quiet light wings - 3 of them are high speed mounted on AIO) from which 6 is intake (bottom and side) and 4 are out blowing, AIO and one in the back\n\nAsus Z790 Prime P  \ni7-13700k with Liquid cooler 360 ii (with fans I mentioned)  \nCorsair Dominator 64gb RAM with stable but small OC to 6000mhz  \nGigabyte P1000GM PSU (not the best choice, probably not the culprit)  \nAsus 5080 Astral OC - runs fine, low temps, got for a price of gigabyte 5080  \n2x 3440x1440p monitors\n\nRoom temp usually is around 24-25 Celsius\n\nProblem:  \nMy components for this build has changed, starting from AIO, to case to GPU, but temp problem is persistant. Basically even on idle its 40-50 C and with light workload, some chrome open it jumps from 40-70C. In games it was OKish, not going over 90 (only during 1s spikes sometimes) and in e.g. BF6 with medium settings and some AI frame gen it was jumping around 60-85 which was fine'ish, but I've seen other running 70 max.  \nToday I changed my thermal paste for CPU and it got even worse, now it's 5-10C more. I screwed my AIO quite tight (only 2 screws for my AIO), as soon as I felt pressure + 1 more turn. Maybe worth to mention, I bought the paste maybe 6-7y ago, could it be it? Previously I had applied one that came with AIO.\n\nI'm not sure what am I doing wrong at this point. My GF in same room, has 240mm aio with same components but GPU, she has 4070ti s in her system and much smaller case, and  her pc runs quietly in 70ies C under gaming, and runs 2 2k monitors. She has little undervolt applied, mine is more restrictive -\n\nI undervolted voltage by -0.065V, set Long and Short W to 273, Amps to 307, Enforcing all limits. Is my CPU faulty? I must be doing something really wrong\n\nFor other games it also goes into 80s now\n\nP.S. bonus issue-  \nWhenever I unplug my power cord, bios is erased. I changed bios battery, but it didn't help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI‚Äôm looking for a quiet mechanical keyboard with a Numpad for use in Blender, video editing, story games, and general browsing. It definitely shouldn‚Äôt be loud like the typical mechanical keyboards you see in electronics stores.\n\nI‚Äôve been looking at the Redragon K668. It has hot-swappable red switches and seems to be quiet. Has anyone used it? How quiet is it really, and would you recommend it for both work and gaming?\n\nAny other recommendations around ‚Ç¨60 that are quiet and have a Numpad would be appreciated!\n",

The ASUS one has some VRM temperature problems in comparison with MSI (around 5 degrees hotter than MSI), will this be a problem in the long run?\n3.

    "selftext": "(Apologies if my Reddit etiquette is poor; I'm not on here much)\n\nI've been on laptops for a long time now, but I've had 2 crap out in less than 5 years, so it's time to build a new rig. Problem: The last Custom build was a Win7 machine my dad made for me, so I'm a little out of my depth. Pcpartpicker has helped me put a prospective build together, but considering I didn't know what half of the terms on there meant when I started, I'm hoping some experienced builders can lend their guidance.\n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/LdgWgn\n\nThis is what I've got, but before I pull the trigger I wanna know if any of these components are wildly above/below the rest in performance so I'm not bottlenecking right out of the gate. I want this build to be powerful with the ability to upgrade eventually once these guts get old without having to start from scratch. The heaviest games I can think of off the top of my head I want this to run while Discord and a few internet tabs are open are (moderately modded but nothing insane I don't think) Minecraft, lightly modded BG3, and PEAK. \n\nCompatability was green but noted I may need a mounting adapter to fit this cooler into the board,  and that RAM clearance may or may not work out. I wanna know if I'm making a huge mistake with any of these parts and what you'd use in that space; also, below the row for monitors on pcpartpicker, there's lists for a bunch of extra stuff down there; Network Adapters, Case Fans, etc. Are any of those things necessary/a good idea? I have a headset, keyboard and mouse, functional if a little old at this point, but the rest I'm not sure about. \n\nOne more thing: I'll be getting my now dead laptop back from it's unsuccessful trip to the repair shop soon, and want to clone it's drives to this new prospective rig. I'm pretty sure the last time I \"cloned\" a drive, it was a bunch of manual copy/pasting with an external storage drive... Is there any common builder wisdom about cloning drives I should know about? I think I can figure out how to actually do it myself between friends and the internet, but I'd rather learn about potential pitfalls on reddit than firsthand.\n\nThanks!",

Should I go 5900x which is listing at $256 on Amazon or a 5700x3d which is listing anywhere from $300-330 USD on Amazon or Newegg. 5950x ($287) is not out of the question but that's more productivity. I do mostly gaming and sometimes excel sheets for work. \n\nI don't see myself going to AM5 for at least two years. To me it makes sense to spend less than $350 for a new CPU vs 700+ for CPU, Motherboard, RAM etc. \n\nI've also gotten into PS3 and X360 Emulation the last few months if that helps with choice at all since I know CPU is pretty heavily used from my experience so far.

    "selftext": "*slight edit. Posting here cause the amd mods suggested it. Mostly a software question*\n\n'Help with Adrenaline minimal install'\n\nI'm switching from an Nvidia rtx 3080 over to a RX 9070 and I need some info on the minimal install option for the adrenaline software. I tried looking up everything in regards to a very simple feature for it but can't find anything concrete.....an fps cap. I'll confess. I'm used to the nvidial control panel and using that to cap the fps and enable driver vsync cause I had a few older games mess up by using the in game caps (GTA 5 and mgs v) and still want to be able to use a control panel ESC system and use MSI afterburner for the overlay for metrics. I know that the old catalyst software is still available but no doubt its probably out of date and can only imagine it might not work well with the latest games, even though I've had no problems with the nvidia control panel so far. \n\nSo yeah. Does the minimal install still allow you to configure individual games, in regards to settings similar to control panel? Ie fps limits, v sync, af settimgs etc. I ask cause I read that's only allowed on the full install of adrenaline, but I don't want that because the over clocking can conflict with MSI afterburner (even though this time around I'm just going to run it at stock. No oc and no tweaking)\n\nAny advice or info would be appreciated. I was kinda hoping I'd find some in depth comparisons but haven't found anything. Again thanks to whoever can help!",

    "selftext": "Hey guys,  \nI'm thinking of building my third PC rig. I've had some low-end builds in the past, but this time I want to go a bit more all-out (without completely breaking the bank). I've spent a few hours researching and putting this parts list together, and I'm pretty happy with it but I wanted to see what you guys thought of it and if you had any suggestions?  \nI wanted to go for the Fractal Terra case because I use a Mac mini as my main work machine and like the super small aesthetic, but I feel like a slightly larger case (and mATX motherboard/other components) would help with upfront costs (no ITX tax), and let me upgrade further without getting an entirely new case.  \n  \nParts Rationale:\n\n* Ryzen 5 9600X - Likely don't need the Ryzen 7 series since this is a gaming-focused machine, and just that. The savings here let me buy a better GPU! I've considered the X3D but I'm aiming for 1440p/4K gaming and I hear the X3D doesn't really provide any meaningful benefit at these resolutions (though I'm happy to be proven wrong!)\n* Crucial Pro 2x16GB - A happy 32GB to start off with. IF things get more demanding, I can always throw another stick or two into the system for 48/64GB\n* WD Black SN7100 512GB/4TGB - For the boot drive and for the games drive respectively. PCIe gen 5 doesn't seem to be anything too crazy, probably not something I'd notice or benefit from. I hear these are fast and reliable drives, and the 4TB means I hopefully wouldn't need to uninstall games too often (though the motherboard has 3 NVMe slots, so worst case I can throw another one in)\n* RX 9070XT - Performs a lot better than the 7700XT from what I've heard, plus I value the ability to use RT if I want to, plus FSR4 support\n\nThe build will be running a flavour of Linux setup to essentially emulate the Steam Deck. Boot straight into the Deck UI (with the option to exit to the KDE Desktop), HDMI-CEC to turn on the TV when the PC turns on/wakes from sleep, 2.4GHz dongle for my controllers to wake from sleep, etc. I essentially want to build a console, which is a super exciting idea for me.\n\nIm open to any suggestions, as I really want to make this **THE** PC build and not unintentionally waste money on parts I could've saved on and then put money towards other parts.\n\n  \n[https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/TTmZVF](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/TTmZVF)",

Also is this a good SSD or would you recommend something else?\n\nINFO: I play every game at 4k since both my screen are in 4k\n\nBonus?

The GPU needs three 8 pin power cables, whereas the PSU only came with 2 (6+2) pin PCIe cables, which are both daisy chained.

    "selftext": "Hi, i'm back with my temperature issues and at this point I am not sure what I am doing wrong.\n\nI've been upgrading/building my PCs and for others for past 10+ years, but I am really not an expert, first builds were with cheap MBs to save a buck and I didn't know anything about ram speeds or that PSU did matter and I haven't seen a problem like this before, but that's not the point.\n\nMy **13700k** is HOT, google say it's ok, but I've seen people doing much better, so I need an advice or just vent a bit.\n\nLet's start with my system.\n\nI have very spacious Lian Li O11D evo Case with 10 Fans (3 Lian li reverse lcd for drip and 7 high be quiet light wings - 3 of them are high speed mounted on AIO) from which 6 is intake (bottom and side) and 4 are out blowing, AIO and one in the back\n\nAsus Z790 Prime P  \ni7-13700k with Liquid cooler 360 ii (with fans I mentioned)  \nCorsair Dominator 64gb RAM with stable but small OC to 6000mhz  \nGigabyte P1000GM PSU (not the best choice, probably not the culprit)  \nAsus 5080 Astral OC - runs fine, low temps, got for a price of gigabyte 5080  \n2x 3440x1440p monitors\n\nRoom temp usually is around 24-25 Celsius\n\nProblem:  \nMy components for this build has changed, starting from AIO, to case to GPU, but temp problem is persistant. Basically even on idle its 40-50 C and with light workload, some chrome open it jumps from 40-70C. In games it was OKish, not going over 90 (only during 1s spikes sometimes) and in e.g. BF6 with medium settings and some AI frame gen it was jumping around 60-85 which was fine'ish, but I've seen other running 70 max.  \nToday I changed my thermal paste for CPU and it got even worse, now it's 5-10C more. I screwed my AIO quite tight (only 2 screws for my AIO), as soon as I felt pressure + 1 more turn. Maybe worth to mention, I bought the paste maybe 6-7y ago, could it be it? Previously I had applied one that came with AIO.\n\nI'm not sure what am I doing wrong at this point. My GF in same room, has 240mm aio with same components but GPU, she has 4070ti s in her system and much smaller case, and  her pc runs quietly in 70ies C under gaming, and runs 2 2k monitors. She has little undervolt applied, mine is more restrictive -\n\nI undervolted voltage by -0.065V, set Long and Short W to 273, Amps to 307, Enforcing all limits. Is my CPU faulty? I must be doing something really wrong\n\nFor other games it also goes into 80s now\n\nP.S. bonus issue-  \nWhenever I unplug my power cord, bios is erased. I changed bios battery, but it didn't help.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys,  \nI'm thinking of building my third PC rig. I've had some low-end builds in the past, but this time I want to go a bit more all-out (without completely breaking the bank). I've spent a few hours researching and putting this parts list together, and I'm pretty happy with it but I wanted to see what you guys thought of it and if you had any suggestions?  \nI wanted to go for the Fractal Terra case because I use a Mac mini as my main work machine and like the super small aesthetic, but I feel like a slightly larger case (and mATX motherboard/other components) would help with upfront costs (no ITX tax), and let me upgrade further without getting an entirely new case.  \n  \nParts Rationale:\n\n* Ryzen 5 9600X - Likely don't need the Ryzen 7 series since this is a gaming-focused machine, and just that. The savings here let me buy a better GPU! I've considered the X3D but I'm aiming for 1440p/4K gaming and I hear the X3D doesn't really provide any meaningful benefit at these resolutions (though I'm happy to be proven wrong!)\n* Crucial Pro 2x16GB - A happy 32GB to start off with. IF things get more demanding, I can always throw another stick or two into the system for 48/64GB\n* WD Black SN7100 512GB/4TGB - For the boot drive and for the games drive respectively. PCIe gen 5 doesn't seem to be anything too crazy, probably not something I'd notice or benefit from. I hear these are fast and reliable drives, and the 4TB means I hopefully wouldn't need to uninstall games too often (though the motherboard has 3 NVMe slots, so worst case I can throw another one in)\n* RX 9070XT - Performs a lot better than the 7700XT from what I've heard, plus I value the ability to use RT if I want to, plus FSR4 support\n\nThe build will be running a flavour of Linux setup to essentially emulate the Steam Deck. Boot straight into the Deck UI (with the option to exit to the KDE Desktop), HDMI-CEC to turn on the TV when the PC turns on/wakes from sleep, 2.4GHz dongle for my controllers to wake from sleep, etc. I essentially want to build a console, which is a super exciting idea for me.\n\nIm open to any suggestions, as I really want to make this **THE** PC build and not unintentionally waste money on parts I could've saved on and then put money towards other parts.\n\n  \n[https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/TTmZVF](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/TTmZVF)",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been wondering about this for a while. Why don‚Äôt we have headphones that can tell if a sound‚Äôs coming from above or below when you tilt your head? It‚Äôs pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound‚Äôs coming from. I don‚Äôt see any technical reason why we can‚Äôt have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

    "selftext": "Hi!  \n\n  \nSince this game is getting more attention with its upcoming release, I wanted to highlight an aspect about animation work.  \n\nYou‚Äôve probably seen clips where the ARC drones (environmental enemies) attack players in pretty spectacular ways.  \nExample:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa6sr6/mistakes\\_were\\_made/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa6sr6/mistakes_were_made/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI came across an article explaining how EMBARK creates these animations, and I think it deserves more attention than yet another scripted destruction system we see in big AAA titles. [https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Hus√°k! üòä), but soon,¬†**thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his¬†**passion, enthusiasm, and desire**¬†are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Hus√°k himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to¬†**expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile ‚Äì and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point,¬†**we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that¬†**Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind¬†**Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*‚ÄúHey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors ‚Äî If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you‚Äôre gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step ‚Äî launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign ‚Äî just like old times ‚Äî and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let‚Äôs rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let‚Äôs build that castle from the ground up ‚Äî together.‚Äù*\n\nWe can‚Äôt express how much this means to us.¬†**Warhorse Studios inspired us**¬†\\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives¬†**Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let‚Äôs carry this legacy forward.¬†**Together!**\n\nKickstarter:¬†[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord:¬†[https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit:¬†[r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook:¬†[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX:¬†[https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website:¬†[https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I‚Äôd describe the thematic heart of AA and we‚Äôve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It‚Äôs also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we‚Äôre still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe‚Äôve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We‚Äôve learned a lot from our past games ‚Äî Astral Ascent most of all ‚Äî and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project‚Ä¶ which, truth be told, probably won‚Äôt be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that‚Äôs the short of it about us.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that‚Äôs to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We‚Äôre excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

    "selftext": "Windows is very close to being great for gamepads. There are multiple third-party apps (like r/Playnite) that allow for a great gamepad experience in multiple aspects, however, typing is NOT one of them.\n\nA lot of games require typing, which prevents us from having a true couch gaming experience on PC, but there's an easy solution that only Microsoft can provide:\n\n**1 - Allow us to open the new on-screen keyboard (OSK), with gamepad support, that at the moment is reserved for tablets, by clicking or pressing A over text boxes, and through a gamepad button combo.**   \nThis would allow the OSK to be invoked by either simulating a mouse click with the gamepad (for older games), selecting text boxes with A (on modern games that eventually support this feature), or force-opening it with a gamepad combo for games that are particularly iffy with text boxes. This would effectively bypass the need to get out of the sofa and use a keyboard just to name your character in a new RPG, for example. \n\n**2 - Make sure the OSK, on gamepad mode, captures all gamepad inputs for itself, and does not allow these inputs to reach the game in the background.**  \nThis would prevent a big problem with the already existing Steam keyboard: if you're not playing the game with SteamInput enabled (for example, in games that already support Xbox gamepads), all the gamepad buttons being pressed while typing are also reaching the game, causing your character to walk, attack or do whatever actions correspond to the typing shortcuts, including leaving the text box in case of emulators. Capturing all inputs from the gamepad and only sending what is actually being typed (the keyboard keys) would prevent this, and massively increase compatibility with older games.\n\n**Bonus:** give us the fullscreen Windows experience for desktops, and allow it to use custom library managers (like Playnite). This would fix a lot of problems with window focus that can happen when launching games in borderless fullscreen and also make the experience more seamless. \n\nI believe these tweaks would greatly improve the gaming experience on Windows, bringing it much closer to an authentic Xbox experience.",

Each one has unique traits and drops items that can be used to craft decorations, furniture, and lures. Sometimes they get attacked by Ghosts who just want to spoil the fun.\n\nThe demo covers the first seven in-game days (around 1.5-2 hours of play). You can:\n\n* Attract and care for your first Critterlings\n* Decorate your farm and house with dozens of craftable items\n* Experiment with items that lure specific species\n* Meet the Townfolk and explore the beach\n\nIt‚Äôs colorful, weird, and hopefully very cozy.\n\nüëâ **Play the demo here:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2497070/Cosmic\\_Coop/]()\n\nI‚Äôll be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions about development, inspiration, or the design process.\n\nThanks for checking it out and for supporting small devs during Next Fest!",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

It‚Äôs pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound‚Äôs coming from. I don‚Äôt see any technical reason why we can‚Äôt have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you.

    "selftext": "In this chat, Gooseman opens up about the challenges of starting from zero, which he's had to do more than once in his career. I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

I don‚Äôt see any technical reason why we can‚Äôt have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you.

Should I be concerned? I got this AIO only a few months ago, and I'm using the \"combined\" cable they put in the box instead of the one that has separate cables for everything, because I need to hook up the rest of my fans somewhere and I don't have 6 fan headers.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is my very first AIO and I don't have prior experience with what sounds it should and shouldn't make, that's why I'm asking :D\n\nThe picture attached is the current orientation of the AIO inside the case\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n[Picture of the insides of my PC](https://preview.redd.it/4p3sx59otbwf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=130ce81cf51bab130e0ddaa06196a0d0944e30e6)\n\n",

For a while restarting my PC fixed that, sometimes it took a couple restarts but eventually fixed itself and would run fine until I turned it off. Few days ago it started doing it after 30-60 minutes of usage which would still usually get fixed after the restart. Now after about an hour of running my PC becomes completely unusable. It‚Äôll run perfect until all of a sudden it‚Äôll freeze for a few seconds and then my mouse is pretty much MIA. Not sure if it‚Äôs a mouse problem but I have 2 and they both do it. This happens regardless of what I‚Äôm doing whether it be gaming or just using a browser it‚Äôll eventually lag out and be completely unusable. No overheating issues from what I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôve updated drivers, did a pc clean, no viruses, redownloaded windows, and last night I hard reset my pc and it still continues to do it. Any help would be appreciated. ",

This monitor, or the Acer variant, could be a candidate to be my next one, however I don't see a lot of reviews about its 2D capabilities. I currently own an Acer Predator X27bmiphzx monitor, which is an IPS monitor with local dimming and quantum dot technology. I really like its HDR capabilities and very bright and vivid colors, although the white halo around bright objects on a dark background and black uniformity are issues, including the very noisy fan, the noisiest component of my PC . I wonder if the 3D monitors can achieve similar HDR performance and color performance. \n\nAny experience or opinions would be very valuable.\n\n  \nThanks...",

    "selftext": "So, I've seen some other threads on this, but the problem doesn't seem to get answered, so thought I'd ask.\n\nI have an Inspiron 5515 (2021) with 5500U processor, default 8GB RAM. \n\nAfter some months, I added a 2nd identical RAM stick to make it 16GB. I also did the same on my wife's identical Inspiron 5515.\n\nAfter maybe a year, the PC only started showing 8GB in Task Manager and BIOS. No idea if this followed BIOS/firmware or Windows update, or was just random. \n\nI then bought a new GSkill kit with correct [max] specs for MB - DDR4 3200 CL18-18-18-43 1.20v.\n\nLaptop still only shows 8GB in Task Manager and BIOS. \n\nBoth sticks will boot and display in DIMM 2. When tried in DIMM 1, PC shows black screen, does not boot. \n\nHowever, CPU-Z will accurately show RAM specs for both slots when plugged in. \n\nFWIW, my wife's laptop still shows 16GB. I guess she's running the same Windows version, and at least one of the firmware versions I was running when it didn't show. I've also tried updating \nto 24H2, and this summer's latest BIOS, and no improvement. \n\nAny ideas? Faulty MB slot? But if so, why does CPU-Z accurately display specs? ",

    "selftext": "This was an abomination I whipped up with a Dell Optiplex 5090 SFF last year. These computers normally come with a proprietary PSU that is too weak to accept anything but a GPU powered by the PCIe slot, not to mention it's cramped enough in there that they usually only fit low profile cards.\n\nHowever, through dumb luck and staring at pictures hard enough, I was able to figure out that the much more capable 500W PSU available for Dell's XPS line (5th photo, in case it helps anyone) had matching connectors for the Optiplex 5090 mobo, and took up the same space as the Optiplex PSUs did. I snagged one off eBay and slapped it into the SFF case, and we were off to the races.\n\nNext, I 3D printed an external GPU stand complete with a bracket lock and paired it with an ASUS Dual 3060 TI and a PCIe ribbon cable, allowing a full-size card to connect to the cramped PCIe slot.\n\nOn top of this, I had the following specs on the inside, just to add to the ridiculousness:\n\n* Intel i7-10700 CPU, capable of upgrading to the 11th gen line\n* 64 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM\n* A 4-terabyte SATA III SSD in the hard drive bay, an 8 terabyte NVMe SSD in the motherboard's M.2 slot, and a PCIe M.2 slot expansion board (with RGB you can see bouncing off the GPU ribbon cable) loaded with a 4-terabyte NVMe SSD and a 2-terabyte SATA SSD\n\nRegretfully, I no longer have this Frankenstein build because I sold it to someone who was able to look past my horrible cable management skills. But it was a very fun experiment and a solid PC while it was my daily driver.",

Tried everything under the sun to try and get it to work and everyone is telling me to send the card back. BUT I just installed some used DDR4 ram(2x16, only 2 slots on motherboard) this weekend the day before I got the GPU. This morning while I was waiting on the company I bought the GPU from to open I decided to see if I could figure anything else out. I went into the BIOS and upped my ram speed to 2666 and avowed didn‚Äôt crash immediately this time.(took about 10 min) That led me to look into ram being the culprit and found this https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/4155833/fixed-nvlddmkm-gaming-video-crash-error-(bad-ram)\n\nI have already initiated the return process for the card.

I struggle most with its limited 8gb of vram as i am on vr a lot and do tons of mods on different games. It practically wont run vrchat at all with avatars on, and in many games i struggle to play on anything other than low settings (which I don't actually mind too much). Ive finally hit a point which id like to play bigger games for youtube.  \n\n\nMy research has come to something like a 5070 (if it fits) or 9800 xtx (which i know little about other than it might be a better card?).  The more vram the better, but id rather not blow the bank, otherwise id rather just save and suffer for a few more years get a full new build (this time one i build myself, if i have a job that give me enough time and money to do so). \n\nThese are my main questions:\n\nWhat would be the best gpu to upgrade to from a 4060 on a r16 alienware? (Any brand as long as its compatible)  \nWhat would fit? (maximum length of 312mm i believe)  \nBest power supply to go with it?  \nWhat wont be too bottlenecked by my i7-14700f CPU? (Do i need to upgrade it?)\n\nand add any other recommendation's y'all have. Feel free to go full lecture mode, i enjoy learning new things and expanding on what i already know.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I asked earlier about using a PSU with a single daisy chained PCIe cable and almost everyone said not to. So I found this XPG Pylon 750W for a good price, and if I understand correctly, it has 2 separate PCIe cables so it can deliver enough power for the RTX 5070 (each cable 150W so both are 300W + 75W from the motherboard = 375W), right? \nAlso. It's a tier C power supply, so while I know not the best, it's good enough, correct? ",

As per the logs there is no temperature hotspots, I have also repasted CPU, cleaned fans and even repasted the GPU.\n\nSome additional observations :\n\n* The issue tends to happen during AAA Gaming. I completed Silksong and Hades 2, and didn't face a single crash.\n* The issue also tends to resolve itself for a month or two, and there is no crash at all.\n* When the issue does show up, it is consistent. Post a crash restart, I can boot into the game and it will crash after minutes (even during non trivial screens like level up menu)\n* Keeping the PC off for a day or two, alleviates the issue for a little bit. This is could be just incidental or wrong observation.\n\nMy best guess is it is due to the power draw, though not sure how to check that in HWInfo. I believe the issue might have started after upgrading from 5600X to 5900X. Though its hard to be sure, and I don't believe my setup should exceed the 750w Draw during gaming.\n\nThe other might be related to static build up, but again it should also cause crash during idle. My PC tends to be on 24x7 for Jellyfin and laziness, so it should have been noticed then.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, since this has driven me insane over the past year.",

These computers normally come with a proprietary PSU that is too weak to accept anything but a GPU powered by the PCIe slot, not to mention it's cramped enough in there that they usually only fit low profile cards.\n\nHowever, through dumb luck and staring at pictures hard enough, I was able to figure out that the much more capable 500W PSU available for Dell's XPS line (5th photo, in case it helps anyone) had matching connectors for the Optiplex 5090 mobo, and took up the same space as the Optiplex PSUs did. I snagged one off eBay and slapped it into the SFF case, and we were off to the races.\n\nNext, I 3D printed an external GPU stand complete with a bracket lock and paired it with an ASUS Dual 3060 TI and a PCIe ribbon cable, allowing a full-size card to connect to the cramped PCIe slot.\n\nOn top of this, I had the following specs on the inside, just to add to the ridiculousness:\n\n* Intel i7-10700 CPU, capable of upgrading to the 11th gen line\n* 64 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM\n* A 4-terabyte SATA III SSD in the hard drive bay, an 8 terabyte NVMe SSD in the motherboard's M.2 slot, and a PCIe M.2 slot expansion board (with RGB you can see bouncing off the GPU ribbon cable) loaded with a 4-terabyte NVMe SSD and a 2-terabyte SATA SSD\n\nRegretfully, I no longer have this Frankenstein build because I sold it to someone who was able to look past my horrible cable management skills. But it was a very fun experiment and a solid PC while it was my daily driver.",

The gpu has power and the fans spin, also the VGA light and so on is off on .y motherboard. I use a HDMI 2.0+ and don't have a displayport at the moment. So my question is, do I need a display port or do I need to update my motherboard bios? Or maybe even something else. I have an MSI B450 GAMING PRO carbon ac. I did see there was a new bios released this september.",

    "selftext": "**Please ignore the cables and mess, that is currently in progress to be fixed.**  \n  \nI‚Äôm trying to add a 4th display under my main monitor. All three of my current monitors are wall-mounted, so there‚Äôs about an 8.5-inch vertical gap between the desk and the bottom edge of the middle screen. I‚Äôd like to fill that space with a small monitor that can tilt upward toward me, something around 15 inches smaller or larger is fine if it fits nicely.\n\nI work two remote jobs. My main desktop runs my primary job, and my company laptop handles a second, lighter role where I mostly respond to messages and manage a small team. Both setups really benefit from having two screens. I plan to use a KVM switch to share my keyboard/mouse and possibly one or two monitors between the systems, but I‚Äôd like a dedicated screen underneath the middle monitor for quick multitasking.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Fits within an 8.5-inch gap under my center monitor\n* Can tilt upward (20‚Äì35¬∞ ideally)\n* Doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy ‚Äî 1080p is fine\n* Ideally plug-and-play (HDMI or USB-C)\n* Clean look that blends well with my setup\n\nI‚Äôve looked into stretch bar displays, which would look amazing, but most are expensive or complicated to set up. So I‚Äôm leaning toward a portable monitor as a practical option for now. I just want to see if anyone has found a budget-friendly tilted display that fits under a main monitor like this.",

Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything‚Äôs dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

I also swapped out the knobs, the badge on the keyboard and the badge on the numpad for gold options. Loving the brass plate in this build.\n\nSwitches: Neo X Keygeek Oat\n\nKeycaps: GMK Black & Gold ",

    "selftext": "My experiences:\n\n**Corsair K95 (gone)**\n\nThe prints on that are laser imprinted and quickly faded. it became glossy and looked dirty after some use. It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper. \n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I just about had it after about 10 keys with the problem. I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone but I am just about fed up with reliability issues and GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust that 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at odd locaiton. What other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

There are broken rivets so it will need a bolt mod in addition to building a case of some sorts and something to connect to the membrane cables to wire up to a controller.

    "selftext": "I have built/modded several premium boards, but regardless of that fact,  I picked up a used Ducky One Mini. I had seen a video by Alex Otos, praising his 60% Ducky budget keyboard. He said it was his go-to for gaming. Therefore I decided to pick one up and guess what? I love it. I can‚Äôt really explain it, but it just feels good to type on. It has a quiet sound profile (which I typically hate), and has a pretty minimalist vibe to it.\n\nWhen I first bought it (used off of eBay), I immediately regretted it because I felt I overpaid for it after I foolishly looked around and found some for half the price. As soon as I got it, I tried to swap out keycaps and those freakin‚Äô inductive switches came out with every single keycap! I soon realized the used budget keycap set I had grabbed (off of eBay, as well) were way too tight. I had to fight every single switch to get it out of the keycap I had pulled off (when I decided I didn‚Äôt like them and chose to go back to the original keycaps). They were so hard to detach from the keycaps, my hands were killing me. I finally resorted to a rubber jar gripper that made the job a little easier as I got down to the last few keycaps.\n\nThe inductive switches came out crazy easy and I was not happy about that. However, when I got it back together again and just chose a few colorful keycaps for some modifier keys, I liked the simple look of it (and I will never again swap out the keycaps!) My hands literally ached the entire next day. \n\nHowever, after using it for a few days, I was hooked!  You have got feel it to understand it.\n\nLayout: 60%\nConnectivity: Tri-mode\nCase: ABS\nMount Style: Gasket-mount\nPlate material: SPCC Steel\nSwitches: Ducky Inductive Switches-linear, 3.5 mm total travel, 40g initial force\nDampening Design: Ducky QUACK Mechanics+ with 7-layer dampening\nKeycaps: Ducky 85% high-purity PBT Double-shot PBT\nStabalizers: Ducky Plate-Mounted\nHot-Swappable: Yes\nReport Rate: 1000 Hz\nSoftware: Web-based \nModifier Keycaps - Double-shot PBT (Ali Express)\n\n",

And I love it! I got all parts and built it nearly two days ago.\n\nI had no experience on mechanical keyboards (unless we count typing some Red Dragon keyboard I found in some store for one second), so I was gambling how the switches should behave. And I really like what I chose... I don't want to say I hit the jackpot yet, still a very new keyboard.\n\nThe keycaps have an uneven height... You can see on the function keys on the middle. But so far, not an actual issue when using my keyboard. And they're like soft on the touch, I really like that. I really liked the look of the MOA profile, and I think they're comfortable in general, especially when playing Tetris - my fingers sit on them seemingly flawlessly.\n\nNot on the sound test video but basically the numpad has a clacky sound in addition. Not (very) loud, especially how I'll almost only use it on Blender, pressing one specific key before I move back to the other keyboard or my mouse.\n\nInserting the keycaps on slot with stabalizers... For the stubborn ones (the enter key being the worst offender) - and I'll admit I don't know if it even actually worked or I was just lucky (I was past at my sleep schedule at that point lmao), I was raising and centering the cross thingies, then have the respective keyboard upside down with my hand (or arm, 1kg keyboard lmao), and insert they keycap in. I had to do all that process more than once with a couple of keycaps, but I did manage to make sure the stabalizers actually do their job.\n\nI have two PCs (a tower, and a tiny Single Board Computer), so the wireless features on both keyboards are reeeeally comfortable for me. I don't mind the keyboard's weight when I have to take out my graphics tablet, my desk is big enough to move around everything I need.",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": ". . . .¬† everything went smoothly;¬† no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.¬† It‚Äôs probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and ‚Äúhow to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers‚Äù videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).¬† Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote¬† - without needing to look at any references during the build. ¬†\n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced ‚Äî just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;¬† make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;¬† checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn‚Äî->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys). ¬†\n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:¬† prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it‚Äôs too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you‚Äôre probably excited to complete quickly.¬† The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta‚Äô get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**¬† if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n¬†¬† **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;¬† $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;¬† unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.¬† (I‚Äôm liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n¬†",

    "selftext": "Curious what you guys think between having the gold keycaps or the black ones only, which do you think looks better? \n\nI bought this board for $20 because the sockets were coming off due to weak soldering. This is a common problem with a GMMK 3, I was just willing to fix it. Definitely not an advertisement lol. I know Glorious gets a lot of hate, but I still enjoy the board even with the known issues. \n\nI enjoy playing around with these boards because of the ability to customize them. I have many other keyboards with about as much customizability, but they don‚Äôt have a matching numpad for me to play with. I finally decided to get the brass plates and do a black and gold build for my cheap keyboard.\n\nKeyboard(s): Glorious GMMK 3 Pro Barebones (Wired Only) and GMMK Numpad \n\nI have 3 plates for these, for this set up it has the Brass Plate. I also swapped out the knobs, the badge on the keyboard and the badge on the numpad for gold options. Loving the brass plate in this build.\n\nSwitches: Neo X Keygeek Oat\n\nKeycaps: GMK Black & Gold ",

Here's the link for F108 Pro (you can search for the others on their site):\n\n[https://aulakeyboard.com/product/aula-f108-pro/](https://aulakeyboard.com/product/aula-f108-pro/)\n\nThere's Keychron Q6, but I hate the knob position:\n\n[https://keychron.net.br/pt/products/keychron-q6-qmk-tecladomecanicopersonalizado?srsltid=AfmBOoqCbCbC18iLNDkQEUTDxdqPd9j0wFKEN5vK5Mus2kB85GjmFlEV](https://keychron.net.br/pt/products/keychron-q6-qmk-tecladomecanicopersonalizado?srsltid=AfmBOoqCbCbC18iLNDkQEUTDxdqPd9j0wFKEN5vK5Mus2kB85GjmFlEV)\n\nThen if you're a rich guy you can customize a GMMK Pro (U$ 500+):\n\n[https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk-3-configurator?step=1&language=English+%28US%29&size=100%25&connectivity=Wired&configSwitchTechnology=Standard+Hotswap+%28MX%29&configPcbOrientation=North-facing&configLayout=ANSI&bottomCase=Black&topCase=Black&switches=Fox+Ultralight+MX&keycaps=Classic+Black&os=Windows&badge=Black&rotaryKnob=Jet+Black&cable=Standard+Black&gasketModules=Firm+%28Silicone%29&switchPlate=Silver+Aluminum&defaults.keycaps=Backlit+Black&defaults.bottomCase=Black%2CJet+Black](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk-3-configurator?step=1&language=English+%28US%29&size=100%25&connectivity=Wired&configSwitchTechnology=Standard+Hotswap+%28MX%29&configPcbOrientation=North-facing&configLayout=ANSI&bottomCase=Black&topCase=Black&switches=Fox+Ultralight+MX&keycaps=Classic+Black&os=Windows&badge=Black&rotaryKnob=Jet+Black&cable=Standard+Black&gasketModules=Firm+%28Silicone%29&switchPlate=Silver+Aluminum&defaults.keycaps=Backlit+Black&defaults.bottomCase=Black%2CJet+Black)\n\n**If you don't need hotswap**\n\nThen there's plenty of options. But I really want hotswap. Here's some of them. I won't link all link, just look for them:\n\nDas Keyboard (several)\n\nSpectre Pro\n\nSteelseries Apex\n\nMountain Everest\n\nThermaltake (several)\n\nMajestouch ninja\n\nLeopold (several)\n\nCoolmaster (several)\n\nCherry keyboards (several)\n\nAdesso (several)\n\niONE Scorpius\n\nLogitech K845\n\nMax Keyboard\n\nTurtle Beach (several)\n\nRosewill (several) speacially Neon K90\n\nCougar Attack X3\n\nAJazz AK35i\n\nCorsair (several) ",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": ". . . .¬† everything went smoothly;¬† no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.¬† It‚Äôs probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and ‚Äúhow to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers‚Äù videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).¬† Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote¬† - without needing to look at any references during the build. ¬†\n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced ‚Äî just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;¬† make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;¬† checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn‚Äî->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys). ¬†\n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:¬† prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it‚Äôs too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you‚Äôre probably excited to complete quickly.¬† The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta‚Äô get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**¬† if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n¬†¬† **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;¬† $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;¬† unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.¬† (I‚Äôm liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n¬†",

I'm mostly looking for 1000+ zones, 27'' 1440p (I don't think the upgrade to 4K is worth it) with around 240Hz so as to improve from my current one. The main upgrade would come from the backlight, where having true blacks shines (pun intended).\n\nI saw some offerings from KTC and AOC, but none had the ~240Hz, they were all 180Hz or so.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated. \n",

My desktop PC has the following:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 7700x\n* RTX 4070 12 GB GPU\n* 32GB DDR5 memory.\n\nThe primary monitor (right in front of me) is a 27\" QHD Dell S2721DGF.

My second monitor (to the right) is a 6+ year old Acer 24\" FHD 16:10 monitor.\n\nI wanted to upgrade the second monitor to a 27\" QHD or 4K display.  This leaves me with several options.\n\n1. Simply replace the 24\" FHD with a new 27\" QHD monitor (refresh/response rates wouldn't really matter).\n2. Get a new 27\" monitor and use the Dell as the secondary monitor.  If I go this route then that leads to several questions.\n   1. Should I replace it with a 2k (same resolution) or 4K monitor?  I'm a bit concerned that 27\" would be too small for 4k and that my setup wouldn't be adequate to play games on a 4k monitor\n   2. Should I consider mini-led given my usage?\n\nAny advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

    "title": "Weird flickering with Adaptive Sync",
    "selftext": "Less than a week ago i bought a Tesla 180hz monitor, its really good and works well. It has a small issue, though, whenever i turn on Adaptive Sync via AMD Adrenalin, it causes a weird flickering picture every few seconds when watching full screen videos or playing fullscreen games. I have tried Radeon chill limited to min 60 fps and max 180 and its still there. I have HDR on but the flickering was an issue even before i had it on. The only solution is turning Adaptive Sync off, but i dont know if its worth it to have it off or on. Also read that it seems to be the monitors fault, since its a budget one (cost me 130 bucks). Is enhanced sync worth it instead with 180hz or should i lower my hz and test it so i can make Adaptive Sync work?",

    "selftext": "OLED has gotta be the most overrated technology ever after ray tracing, it's only popular because normies and consoomers just look at the wow-factor and not about the longevity or practicality of a product. \n\nWhy would the average person spend x3 times the price of a high end IPS when OLED's are inevitably doomed to fail by either dead pixels or burn-in while having issues like VRR flickering out of the box? IPS has none of the long term issues while costing way less, the only downside is the slightly worse picture quality and negligible extra 3ms response times. (You don't buy an OLED for competitive games don't lie, OLED blacks actually gives you a disadvantage in competitive games)\n\nThe reason why they charge so much for OLED is because of its popularity and audience not the hardware, OLED fans will defend OLED like their life depends on it and will even gaslight people into buying one. If you're not rich and don't have money to waste every 2-3 years just buy a good IPS monitor that will last you 10+ years.",

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G464 with images",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. I come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). A few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. First, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. My perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". With those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). The cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. If I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! For any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!

    "selftext": "I have a dilemma. I recently built a PC and due to lack of money I bought a Samsung Odyssey G50D 2K 180Hz IPS, which I am happy with. The monitor I wanted (but couldn't afford at the time) is the Dell G3223Q 4K 144Hz.\n\nNow I have saved up the money to buy it. I have read here and on rtings and the opinions are somewhat divided but I have seen many who are happy with it. I want to use the Dell as my main monitor and the Odyssey as a second monitor placed above the Dell. What do you say, should I wait? Do you have another better alternative? P.S. I want IPS because I am afraid of burn in and everything that is not IPS tires my eyes.\n\nAlso, do you think there will be a noticeable difference between 180Hz and 144Hz? I should mention that I don't play games at the moment, maybe in the future if I have time. So gaming is not a priority.\n\nThanks\n\nLE: another option in that price range would be LG UltraGear‚Ñ¢ 32G810SA-W",

I believe I have narrowed it down to the BenQ SW242Q and the Dell U2424HE. I shoot 90% B&W and do very little printing. I understand the fundamental differences between these monitors, including as regards to color gamut and calibration, but I don't have a sense of which would be better suited to B&W editing. $500 is my budget, 24in is the max size. Monitor must detach from stand. I would prefer not to buy used. Any advice that adheres to my stated criteria would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI am in a unique position where I can get a monitor through my company for a considerably reduced price, as they are funding ¬£500 / $670 towards it. The question is, which monitor should I go for here, or should I keep my own?\n\nThe first option that I currently own is a Samsung Odyssey 1440p 144Hz 32‚Ä≥ QHD, while its nice, its a bit big for my desk and does look a little silly. Also I am concerned about Pixel density and if I am really getting the best image quality.\n\nThe second option is the Dell UltraSharp 27‚Ä≥ QHD 120 Hz. This would have less refresh rate compared to the Samsung one, but I'm wondering if it would give a better picture as the pixel density is higher. This would be ¬£390/$520. Making it free.\n\nThe third option is the more expensive Sony INZONE M10S (27‚Ä≥) OLED 1440p 480Hz monitor, which would be a significant upgrade but prices in around $1717.97 / ¬£1270, but essentially has a price of ¬£770/$1030.\n\nI am torn between either keeping my Samsung, or going for the Dell or Sony one. If I do go for the Sony one I'd be paying ¬£770/$1030 out of of pocket, but would end up with a better/ future proofed monitor. At that price point would it be obvious to get it?\n\nUsually I sit around an arms length away, I do a mix of gaming/productivity work.\n\nAny advice would be good.",

It only happens in games, because Netflix, YouTube HDR have the right colors and even the desktop in HDR is fine, apart the higher brightness.

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G64",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. \n\nI come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). \n\nA few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. \n\nFirst, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. \n\nMy perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". \n\nWith those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). \n\nThe cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. \n\nIf I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! \n\nFor any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!\n\nHere is a link for the same images in decent quality: [https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C](https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C)",

Work is a combination of coding, lots of database work, spreadsheets, email, etc.  The room has a lot of natural light during the day.

My desktop PC has the following:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 7700x\n* RTX 4070 12 GB GPU\n* 32GB DDR5 memory.\n\nThe primary monitor (right in front of me) is a 27\" QHD Dell S2721DGF.  This is also the one that I use to occasionally play single player games.  My second monitor (to the right) is a 6+ year old Acer 24\" FHD 16:10 monitor.\n\nI wanted to upgrade the second monitor to a 27\" QHD or 4K display.  This leaves me with several options.\n\n1. Simply replace the 24\" FHD with a new 27\" QHD monitor (refresh/response rates wouldn't really matter).\n2. Get a new 27\" monitor and use the Dell as the secondary monitor.  If I go this route then that leads to several questions.\n   1. Should I replace it with a 2k (same resolution) or 4K monitor?  I'm a bit concerned that 27\" would be too small for 4k and that my setup wouldn't be adequate to play games on a 4k monitor\n   2. Should I consider mini-led given my usage?\n\nAny advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G464 with images",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. I come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). A few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. First, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. My perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". With those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). The cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. If I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! For any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!

    "title": "Weird flickering with Adaptive Sync",
    "selftext": "Less than a week ago i bought a Tesla 180hz monitor, its really good and works well. It has a small issue, though, whenever i turn on Adaptive Sync via AMD Adrenalin, it causes a weird flickering picture every few seconds when watching full screen videos or playing fullscreen games. I have tried Radeon chill limited to min 60 fps and max 180 and its still there. I have HDR on but the flickering was an issue even before i had it on. The only solution is turning Adaptive Sync off, but i dont know if its worth it to have it off or on. Also read that it seems to be the monitors fault, since its a budget one (cost me 130 bucks). Is enhanced sync worth it instead with 180hz or should i lower my hz and test it so i can make Adaptive Sync work?",

As the title states, I'm looking to buy myself a monitor of smaller dimensions. \n\nThe catch is - I haven't really been able to find many monitors of such sizes, especially with nice resolutions. And great resolution is a must for me. \n\nI've made a mistake of buying a Tesla monitor with 1920 x 1080 resolution, however that's not enough as text often gets blurry. (no issues with the brand or the monitor itself).\n\nAny recommendations for a display of smaller proportions but higher resolutions?\n\nThanks a lot!",

I have read here and on rtings and the opinions are somewhat divided but I have seen many who are happy with it. I want to use the Dell as my main monitor and the Odyssey as a second monitor placed above the Dell. What do you say, should I wait? Do you have another better alternative? P.S. I want IPS because I am afraid of burn in and everything that is not IPS tires my eyes.\n\nAlso, do you think there will be a noticeable difference between 180Hz and 144Hz? I should mention that I don't play games at the moment, maybe in the future if I have time. So gaming is not a priority.\n\nThanks\n\nLE: another option in that price range would be LG UltraGear‚Ñ¢ 32G810SA-W",

    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. \n\nI come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). \n\nA few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. \n\nFirst, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. \n\nMy perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". \n\nWith those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). \n\nThe cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. \n\nIf I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! \n\nFor any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!\n\nHere is a link for the same images in decent quality: [https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C](https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C)",

But I know steep curves for work are a controversial topic. While I didn't love the 800r curve of the LG 34\" OLED I wasn't really hating it either (a lot of people didn't like the curve for work)\n\nIm not the biggest fan of a VA panel though, even this one seems like a faster one based on the review.\n\nHow do you guys feel about this one?

Work is a combination of coding, lots of database work, spreadsheets, email, etc.  The room has a lot of natural light during the day.

My desktop PC has the following:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 7700x\n* RTX 4070 12 GB GPU\n* 32GB DDR5 memory.\n\nThe primary monitor (right in front of me) is a 27\" QHD Dell S2721DGF.  This is also the one that I use to occasionally play single player games.  My second monitor (to the right) is a 6+ year old Acer 24\" FHD 16:10 monitor.\n\nI wanted to upgrade the second monitor to a 27\" QHD or 4K display.  This leaves me with several options.\n\n1. Simply replace the 24\" FHD with a new 27\" QHD monitor (refresh/response rates wouldn't really matter).\n2. Get a new 27\" monitor and use the Dell as the secondary monitor.  If I go this route then that leads to several questions.\n   1. Should I replace it with a 2k (same resolution) or 4K monitor?  I'm a bit concerned that 27\" would be too small for 4k and that my setup wouldn't be adequate to play games on a 4k monitor\n   2. Should I consider mini-led given my usage?\n\nAny advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such.\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, ¬£16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

I had a ton more in the past but those are the ones I kept.\n\nAnyway, the Maxwell came today. I purchased them new from Amazon. The seal was broken on the box, not sure what that was about.\n\nOverall, they somehow feel well built and fragile at the same time. I don't particularly like how they sit on my head. They feel heavy which in itself is not a big deal but they feel unbalanced.\n\nThey sound good for a wireless set, but they don't get loud enough IMO and I feel like I'm missing some details/separation. These could never replace something like the Aeon Closed RT + Dac/Amp for me.\n\nI'm going to send them back and get the Edition XV instead I think. I could see these working for some if you really need a wireless headset. But if you are just playing games at a desk or consuming media at a desk....wired headphones will always be the better option.",

    "selftext": "I'm potentially in the market for my first pair of earbuds and I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could help with. I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

    "selftext": "So, I‚Äôve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn‚Äôt stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it‚Äôs no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they‚Äôd be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they‚Äôre better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they‚Äôre still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I‚Äôm really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an ‚Äúactive analog mode‚Äù which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you‚Äôre looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC‚Ä¶ look no further!",

    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop.

I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisn√¶s Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

Everything feels natural ‚Äî vocals, instruments, bass ‚Äî nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven‚Äôt noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it‚Äôs natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head ‚Äî soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn‚Äôt use them for workouts (they‚Äôre not built for that kind of movement), but they‚Äôre fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal ‚Äî so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you‚Äôre in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you‚Äôve already paired ‚Äî that‚Äôs super convenient. Battery life is great too ‚Äî around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere‚Äôs also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I‚Äôve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I‚Äôve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They‚Äôre not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they‚Äôre absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

I'll primarily be using them with my iPhone 12 Pro.\n\nI've been reading a lot about how using a Bluetooth dongle, like the Sennheiser BTD 600, is essential to get the absolute best sound quality out of these with an iPhone. The catch is that these dongles are USB-C and my iPhone is Lightning.\n\nI found this USB-C to Lightning adapter and was wondering a couple of things:\n * Has anyone here tried this kind of adapter setup with the BTD 600 and a Lightning iPhone? Does it actually work?\n * For those who have used the dongle with an iPhone/iOS device, does it really make a significant difference to the sound quality compared to the standard Bluetooth connection (which uses AAC)?\n\nAny advice would be awesome! Thanks in advance! üéß\n",

    "selftext": "So the last few weeks I‚Äôve been hunting for my first pair of real headphones. I‚Äôve been using Astro A50s for a while they‚Äôre great for gaming, but man, they get super uncomfortable after like an hour.\n\nI‚Äôm totally new to the audiophile world, and holy hell, there are so many options. I had no clue where to start, so of course I did what any sane person would do I went to Reddit. I got a few a different suggestions but as I was searching through all of them I ended up looking up the Meze 109 pros and immediately fell in love with the looks. The wood finish on the cups matches my setup perfectly.\n\nSo I take the plunge ‚Äî $800 on the 109 Pros and another $200 on a Topping DX3 Pro+. Waited a few days, and when they finally showed up, I was blown away by how gorgeous they were. I hook everything up, hit play, and‚Ä¶ they sounded incredibly meh. I was honestly so disappointed. I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn‚Äôt notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I‚Äôd just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I‚Äôd give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two ‚Äî same story. Day three, same thing at first‚Ä¶ until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I‚Äôd never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I‚Äôm just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I‚Äôm not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

    "title": "Frequency Response vs Sound Quality",
    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

    "selftext": "I've tried pretty much every \"spatial audio\" VST and DSP out there, and 99% of it is garbage. Just weird tricks that sound fake. Recently I learned about convolution. I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording. The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe. If you're tired of the gimmicks and want to hear what's really possible, this is the way.\n\n(I don't know English well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.)\n\nupd: I wrote a short instruction on how to start using the dataset - [https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/)",

I decided to google what could be the cause, something led me to believe that the coil wire(?), the ultra thin varnished tiny wire was broken, so I opened it and sure enough it was. Replacement drivers are $192, I bought mine in 2022 for $550. New ones now cost $300\\~$350 depending on sales and such. So I was thinking is it even worth repairing at this point or just upgrade to better headphones. My choice that I landed on (kinda heavily at this stage) are the Meze 109 Pros. I am waiting for a sale for them as I've seen them as low as $628 or so, instead of the $750 they are right now (with coupon or something). I've seen a lot of reviews of these and lot's of people say these could be considered \"end game?\" for a lot of people. I am by no means an audiophile so fair enough in this case. Another thing I heard is the cable provided with these is kinda \"meh\" for the price of the headphones and suggestions seem to say to upgrade it. Not sure to what though. Any input is wholly welcomed. Thanks!\n\nBudget I'm hoping to stick under $800.\n\nMainly for listening to music or playing a few games like Rust and such\n\nI have the SMSL AO300 AMP\n\nAny input is wholly welcomed.

I like character ‚Äî not neutrality.\n\nMy first shortlist was Fostex TH900 Mk2 and Sony MRZ-1, but none were available.  \nI ended up getting the FatFreq Deuce ‚Äî the IEMs with the most powerful sub-bass I‚Äôve ever heard.\n\nThen the Virtuoso was announced, and after auditioning them twice, I finally added them to my collection.\n\n**Cons for first:**\n\nFor around $1000, you get a fancy case and Alcantara on the headband and pads.

Moderately textured, adds weight and body.  \nElectronic and hip-hop tracks sound fantastic.\n\n**Treble**:  \nThere‚Äôs a lot of it. Crisp, sometimes aggressive on cymbals ‚Äî reminds me of the Meze 109 Pro.\n\n**Mids**:  \nThis is where it gets interesting. A&K seems to have borrowed Ultrasone‚Äôs S-Logic spatial trickery,  \nso vocals float ‚Äúin the air‚Äù. When the music carries ambient layers or atmospheric elements, it‚Äôs genuinely captivating.\n\nOverall, the sound is unusual yet very pleasant ‚Äî cohesive, engaging, and fun to listen to.\n\nPosting this because there are almost no reviews or proper FR measurements online.  \nIf you‚Äôre looking for something unique and a bit different, maybe this will help.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I need some advice from the Audeze experts here. I'm about to buy a used LCD-X and I'm confused about which version it is.\n\n**The Facts:**\n\n* Serial Number: **7526658**\n* Purchased new: **March 10, 2021** from xxxx (authorized Swiss dealer)\n* Original invoice included\n* Current asking price: **\\~‚Ç¨850)** \\- seems like a good deal\n\n**The Confusion:** According to what I found online, LCD-X units with serial numbers **7527600 or higher** should be the 2021 revision. This one is 7526658, so technically *below* that threshold.\n\n**BUT** \\- and this is where it gets interesting - **the headphone has ALL the 2021 visual characteristics:**\n\n* ‚úÖ Modern suspension headband (not the old rigid design)\n* ‚úÖ Metal mesh grills (not fabric)\n* ‚úÖ New shiny leather earpads (not the old memory foam style)\n* ‚úÖ Overall 2021 aesthetic\n\nThe seller confirms **everything is original** \\- nothing has been replaced or upgraded. He bought it exactly like this in March 2021.\n\n**My Theory:** Could this be an early 2021 production unit or a transition model for the European market? Maybe Audeze started the 2021 revision slightly before the \"official\" serial number threshold, especially for international markets?\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone seen LCD-X units with 2021 components but serial numbers below 7527600?\n2. Do you think this is actually a 2021 model that just happened to get an earlier serial number?\n3. At 850 EUROS with all 2021 components visible, is this a no-brainer purchase even if there's uncertainty?\n\nI've contacted Audeze support but thought I'd ask the community too. Any insights would be really appreciated!\n\n**TL;DR:** LCD-X serial 7526658 (below 2021 threshold) but has all 2021 physical features. Bought new March 2021. Is it a 2021 model? Worth buying at ‚Ç¨850?",

    "title": "Trying to further my understanding of headphone power needs",
    "selftext": "I made a post in HeadohonesAdvice recently asking about the plausibility of running a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 off a dongle dac. At least half of the purpose of me asking is to learn more about the technical side of this audio technology, because I love learning and I have a strong desire to understand how things work. Having a strong base of knowledge can make me a more informed consumer if nothing else. \n\nThe responses ranged from ‚Äúno dongle will really provide enough power to run those headphones properly, even if it sounds loud enough‚Äù to ‚Äúamps are snake oil, don‚Äôt waste your money, just use an Apple dongle or, if you really want to blast it, get a fiio ka11 or something.‚Äù\n\nI found it truly interesting that both sides of this argument vehemently insist they are correct, which leads me to believe the science that goes into answering a question like this must be very nuanced and not at all black and white. \n\nStarting with the ‚Äúwhy volume doesn‚Äôt always mean enough power‚Äù argument, the best explanation I could find is that dynamic drivers don‚Äôt have consistent voltage needs across the entire audio spectrum. More specifically, the bass and upper treble have more power needs, and that power form what I‚Äôve gathered is voltage for volume and current for driver control. I may be oversimplifying or possibly just wrong so forgive me, but the broader point is that even if the sound in general sounds loud enough and is therefore getting enough power, parts of the frequency response might not be getting what they need especially when it comes to music with a lot of dynamic range or large peaks in volume. The idea here is that ‚Äúit sounds loud enough to me‚Äù could be an incomplete picture. \n\nOn the other side of the argument I‚Äôm seeing that the above argument is a hypothetical and over complicated concern, that for a high-impedance set like the HD 600 if you can get it loud enough for normal listening then you are supplying it with all the power it needs since voltage equals volume and voltage is the main concern with a headphone like this (as opposed to a set that has low impedance but high current needs). Even Crinacle, a popular figure in the audiophile space, claims that something like the ka11 can provide ‚Äúway too much power‚Äù and could easily run a set of HD 800s at ‚Äúear-splitting volume‚Äù.  Not that his word is gold, or anything, but he still strikes me as someone with a lot of experience and knowledge. \n\nMeanwhile back on the other side again, you can look up power calculators for headphones that more or less verify most dongles won‚Äôt be able to supply the necessary voltage or current for high impedance headphones to run at max potential/without clipping part of the frequency response. \n\nApologies for the wall of text here, I just wanted to provide context for the rabbit hole I‚Äôm going down. I should make it clear I‚Äôm not ‚Äúworried‚Äù about this, I‚Äôm perfectly happy to enjoy my headphones and my music without wringing my hands worrying if I‚Äôm doing it properly. This is purely because I want to learn. I like learning. It‚Äôs that simple. And in service of that, I‚Äôd be interested to hear more detailed information on either side of this argument. Correct me where I‚Äôm wrong, elaborate where I‚Äôm oversimplifying, provide additional context I might not be considering. The folks here seem passionate and knowledgeable and I would be grateful if any of you would be willing to share your wisdom with me in the name of learning new things!",

    "selftext": "I just put together this kit I purchased from Aliexpress. I went for two Peerless Tymphony 50mm drivers as recommended in some circles. I have managed to tame the bass. I added some venting to the actual faceplate (can be seen in last pic) I'm finding that seperation is really difficult the whole thing sounds a bit muddy, and hard to seperate lows miods and treble, the wooden cup is open back felt is on the inside of the wooden cup and some cotton used sparingly behind the driver. \n\nIs this just the nature of the driver? Any advice on how to improve soundstage and separation it really doesn't sound as good as I had hoped. Compared to my daily Fostex mk3 planars, these kinda suc,k though it has been fun to build in them.\n\nI have lots of tools to work with, laser cutters 3d printers etc.\n\nThanks for your help and advice in advance it's much appreciated.",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such.\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I had a ton more in the past but those are the ones I kept.\n\nAnyway, the Maxwell came today. I purchased them new from Amazon. The seal was broken on the box, not sure what that was about.\n\nOverall, they somehow feel well built and fragile at the same time. I don't particularly like how they sit on my head. They feel heavy which in itself is not a big deal but they feel unbalanced.\n\nThey sound good for a wireless set, but they don't get loud enough IMO and I feel like I'm missing some details/separation. These could never replace something like the Aeon Closed RT + Dac/Amp for me.\n\nI'm going to send them back and get the Edition XV instead I think.

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "I can't use regular headphones because the lack of airflow starts to irritate my ear canals within minutes. I use bone conduction headphones when out of the house even though the sound quality is terrible, and when I'm inside I use speakers. I feel like if I had some earpads which were extremely breathable, ideally some kind of mesh which is hardly even there, that that would be best. I know I would be giving up some fidelity by doing that, and the sound leakage would mean I need to be discerning of where I wear them, but I think it would still be better than bone conduction.",

    "selftext": "So, I‚Äôve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn‚Äôt stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it‚Äôs no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they‚Äôd be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they‚Äôre better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they‚Äôre still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I‚Äôm really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an ‚Äúactive analog mode‚Äù which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you‚Äôre looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC‚Ä¶ look no further!",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisn√¶s Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are‚Äî 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it‚Äîdo yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say ‚Äî these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural ‚Äî vocals, instruments, bass ‚Äî nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven‚Äôt noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it‚Äôs natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head ‚Äî soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn‚Äôt use them for workouts (they‚Äôre not built for that kind of movement), but they‚Äôre fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal ‚Äî so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you‚Äôre in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you‚Äôve already paired ‚Äî that‚Äôs super convenient. Battery life is great too ‚Äî around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere‚Äôs also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I‚Äôve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I‚Äôve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They‚Äôre not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they‚Äôre absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such.\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, ¬£16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

I had a ton more in the past but those are the ones I kept.\n\nAnyway, the Maxwell came today. I purchased them new from Amazon. The seal was broken on the box, not sure what that was about.\n\nOverall, they somehow feel well built and fragile at the same time. I don't particularly like how they sit on my head. They feel heavy which in itself is not a big deal but they feel unbalanced.\n\nThey sound good for a wireless set, but they don't get loud enough IMO and I feel like I'm missing some details/separation. These could never replace something like the Aeon Closed RT + Dac/Amp for me.\n\nI'm going to send them back and get the Edition XV instead I think. I could see these working for some if you really need a wireless headset.

    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "\n\nHi this my (new to me) Steam Deck OLED 512GB I got used. I decided to get a Steam Deck after debating for about 2 months (doing research during that time for the best handheld.\n\nI decided to this because I'm a 39 yr old dad of 2 teenagers and life is just so busy to sit in front of my PC to play anymore. I've been in a rut because I haven't been really able to play video games like I used to in a few years. I've played videos games since I was 5 and played a lot in my teens and 20s up to my early 30s.\n\nFor the past few years when I go to play a game, I'll open the game for less than 5 minutes and just don't have the motivation or energy to play or when I would force myself to play extensively, gaming felt like a real chore. The only time I game extensively was/is when Id play multiplayer with my kids.\n\nI recently dabbled in emulation on my phone (used to do a lot of emulation on PC) and just wasn't satisfied and that's when I started looking into Handheld PCs. I've always been a major handheld fan since childhood when my father got me the DMG Gameboy and I've had always been into Nintendo and Sony handhelds. And I've always loved the probability and coziness and playing a handheld and I think that's what I needed, to cozy up and be comfortable.\n\nI was dead set on getting a used Ally Z1E then doing the upgraded battery mod because I thought that was the best bang for my budget of $300-$375 and then the other day a listing for a Steam Deck OLED 512GB was listed on FB Marketplace (talked to the guy and he was a passionate gamer so I had confidence it wasn't a scam or a stolen device) so I shot an offer for $300. THIS. WAS. THE. BEST. GAMING. PURCHASE. IVE. MADE. IN. A. LONG. TIME. I've only had the Deck for a few days, downloaded a few games from my steam library first day and actually have been playing games and making progress and it doesn't feel like a chore! I've played at home in the evenings after the kids go to bed and taken it to work to play on breaks and I've put a good amount of game time in and haven't felt that blah feeling I've had. Still setting up emulators so I'm excited to have that on hand as well!\n\nSo this has been the best purchase on top of the steam community and cozy gaming community has been nothing but positive, welcoming and amazing!\n\n",

    "selftext": "As the title states, i‚Äôm currently a 3rd year med student. Every-time I get back home from a long day in clinic or am in mandatory workshops/lecture, i‚Äôm always so drained. I come back home itching to game but just the thought of going to my setup and sitting on another chair and spending more hours just stationary sucks. Just the fact that i‚Äôm done with one room at the hospital or lecture hall just to come to my room and stay there just to game wasn‚Äôt cutting it for me. \n\nThat‚Äôs where I started looking online for the best solution to game on the go and during study breaks at the library rather then having to wait till I get home and that‚Äôs when I saw the amazing things the Steam Deck is capable of.\n\nI promised myself as soon as i‚Äôm done with Boards part 1 i‚Äôd get it and guess what.. I PASSED AND GOT IT. I opted to get the Steam Oled 1tb and OMG has it been a GAME CHANGER!!! The redditors here were NOT lying. It‚Äôs so seamless straight out the box i‚Äôve been spamming portal 1 (the picture up top shows the end credits) portal 2, Brotato and Hades and have been having the time of my life during my study breaks whenever I decide to take them after a good 4 hours study session. \n\nI pulled the trigger on this purchase due to all the positive feedback on this sub reddit. Big thank you to everyone whose always active and up to helping new steam deck users with advice ranging from decky plugins all the way to modding and emulating.\n\nI can say for certain my gaming life is back on and i‚Äôm so happy about it, i‚Äôm no longer a robot slaving away in the clinic all day everyday without enjoying what I used to before medical school!\n\nThank you to everyone who makes this space an awesome one! \n",

Sometimes I can get the Steam menu to open, but even if I kill the game, it is stuck on the screen that was there when it locks up. \n\nIf I restart, all good again. I can even have it sleep for short periods and seems fine. \n\nAny ideas? This is relatively new behavior, since I got my deck 6 months or so ago, I barely ever had to restart it, could sleep extended periods (on dock) and wake up no issues.

But I'd like something to play on Deck too. Ideally something without a lotta dialogue to read and no combat that's gonna require a lot of focus from me. I've seen people recc StS and Hades under other posts here but there's no way I could play either while trying to watch something else.\n\nAlso gonna include this so my post doesn't get flagged:\n\n* `Previously Enjoyed Games`: stitch, Moonstone Island, Stardew Valley, Fields of Mistria(have trouble playing this and other games like stardew in the background due to mines enemies), Dredge, \n* `Preferred Genres`: 2D Platformers, 3D platformers, life sims, fishing games, creature collectors/monster tamers\n* `Budget`: $15 or less is ideal, $20 max\n* `Other Notes`: Ideally something with little-to-no combat, and if it does  have combat it needs to not need much active thought from me(I have trouble in a lotta chaotic rooms in hades, and in StS I tend to need to full concentrate to make decisions each turn/when adjusting my deck)\n\n Thanks in advance!",

The game is fully controller-compatible, and works without issue 100% on the PC itself. \n\nThis isn't to say the controller disconnects or lags, what I mean is that the main menu of the game, the controller either works or it doesn't. It's like the game rolls the dice whether it will accept the controller as an input method or not. This is only an issue when remote playing with an external controller. Sometimes closing/reopening the game fixes the issue, sometimes it doesn't. \n\nDoes anyone have this same experience with any games? Every time I tweak something and the controller works, I think I have found the solution, but then it won't work next time. \n\nI'm looking for anything. For example, I recently just learned that while remote playing \"Hogwarts Legacy\" on SteamDeck with a controller, you have to disable the steamdeck's own left joystick for the controller to behave correctly in menus.\n\nEven if it's something that obscure, I'm hoping to find a consistent solution. \n\nThanks!  Maybe someone on here has some insight as to how different input methods work, and why they would be different during remote play. ",

It has been plugged into a third party dock the entire time, just sitting there. When I finally went to power it on, it started for a second and then immediately shut down. After that, it would not take any charge at all.\n\nI tried plugging it in again, but the device started heating up way too much so I stopped right away. I sent it in for evaluation and was told that the charging IC had shorted.\n\nNo physical damage, no water exposure, no mods. Just regular use and then a long break while docked. Has anyone else had something similar happen? Could the dock have caused it? Curious to hear your thoughts. ",

One of the main reasons I‚Äôm looking into other ways of gaming is because I want to try modding.

If anyone has some input on this, I would appreciate it.\n\nEven with that aside, is the SteamDec overall worth it?\n\nThank you!",

I have to tap the screen) which is fine, but then once in the game I cannot use the Xbox 360 controls and am stuck with keyboard/mouse settings.\n\nI then launched the game in desktop mode and it immediately recognised the gamepad control settings I had selected and worked as hoped.

I thought that to activate FSR I should run the game at lower resolution than the screen,  correct?

    "selftext": "Hey guys. This post is my last resort in fixing my trackpad issues on my own.\n\nAbout four months ago, the right trackpad on my deck stopped working. A few weeks later, the left one stopped working too. As in no motion or pressure detected in the Test Controller tool.\n\nHere's what I've done so far to fix the issue (not all in one go):\n\n1. Restarted in Game Mode\n2. Went to Desktop Mode and installed all updates\n3. Restarted in Desktop Mode\n4. Entered BIOS (even here the trackpads were unresponsive) and enabled Battery Storage Mode\n5. Reset controller settings by holding Quick Access + volume down button.\n6. Reset controller settings to default in the settings\n7. Used Repair OS tool in the settings\n8. Factory Reset \n\nAll proved to be ineffective.\n\nThe trackpads used to work without any issues before the right one first stopped working. The most \"explorative\" thing I did with my deck was install Retrodeck but I never actually got it working or loaded any ROMs so it was just empty. Also installed CachyOS to be able to run WuWa before Steam officially added support.\n\nI've had my Steam Deck since Nov last year. I didn't really play games that heavily use trackpads either so now I'm just honestly confused about what triggered the issue.\n\nYou might be wondering why it took me four months to post here. I didn't want to Factory Reset my deck until I had backed up all my media and just didn't have the time to deal with that until recently. That didn't fix it as well hence this post.\n\nOn top of all that, I live in a SEA country where it's really hard to find shops that repair steam decks, if there even is any.\n\nIf anyone has experienced this issue or something similar and solved it, kindly drop your solutions below. Thank you. :(",

    "selftext": "Hello! I‚Äôve been lurking in this community since I got my steam deck last year when I was 21. The main driving force behind me getting a steam deck was because I simply have no room for a PC desk set up right now. A big reason for me picking one up is because many people praised the device for its emulation capabilities. I became obsessed with the deck when I first got it. (I have a 512gb Oled with a 512sd card) it was so beautiful! And just the sheer knowledge of knowing that any game I bought from steam would follow me to my ultimate goal of owning a PC, made me addicted. I got so wrapped up in playing FF7 and Dave the Diver that emulation completely slipped my mind until almost 1 whole year later. Now I‚Äôm feeling a little bit of FOMO for the switch 2, and a little jealous that they get Mario Galaxy 1 & 2. Then it hit me, I could just emulate it. After setting up emu deck I realized that for a whole year I was just scratching the surface on this thing. It surprises me all the time! Also Quick Resume saves my life‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I can get another device if it doesn‚Äôt have it. I need my little steam deck reward between chores. What‚Äôs a steam deck feature that never ceases to amaze you? ",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nThis might be the wrong place to ask, buy anyway. I hope someone has some insights.\n\nCurrently in the market for my first handheld. As I'm not a huge gamer (Fulltime job, 4 kids, horses and dogs), my playing time is rather limited. I only have an Xbox Series S but I hope with a handheld I might get more playtime (e.g. when kids/wife are watching TV I can't play Xbox...so...). Also not really into AAA games at full/max settings (the Series S can't handle that anyway)\n\nConsidering this, I don't want to spend too much. \n\nCurrently, in some online stores, the Legion Go S Z2 Go SteamOS edition is sold at 399‚Ç¨. So I'm really considering this. But I read that fan noise can go up quite a bit.\n\nHence I'm also looking into the Steam Deck LCD (might get the OLED) which seems quieter. Even if older and not quite as performant, I figure that for my use case it will be enough. \n\nI plan to play in bed while wifey is asleep. So Fan noise is a HUGE factor for me.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nRegards",

When the steam deck first came out, I was excited like the rest of you. I somehow convinced myself from making the purchase when it first got released back in 2022. I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

I basically go to work and home, and whenever I do go somewhere I'm the one driving. \n\nLately though, there's days where I get home from work and I'd like to play some games, but I just don't feel like sitting at my desk to play them (which is what first made the SD appealing). I also have quite the backlog on Steam, and I've heard the Deck is great for burning through your backlog. I'm also interested in getting into emulation of older/retro games, since I feel I missed out on a lot of them from not gaming much as a kid.\n\nSo basically, do you think the Steam Deck would be worth it for me?",

    "selftext": "\n\nHi this my (new to me) Steam Deck OLED 512GB I got used. I decided to get a Steam Deck after debating for about 2 months (doing research during that time for the best handheld.\n\nI decided to this because I'm a 39 yr old dad of 2 teenagers and life is just so busy to sit in front of my PC to play anymore. I've been in a rut because I haven't been really able to play video games like I used to in a few years. I've played videos games since I was 5 and played a lot in my teens and 20s up to my early 30s.\n\nFor the past few years when I go to play a game, I'll open the game for less than 5 minutes and just don't have the motivation or energy to play or when I would force myself to play extensively, gaming felt like a real chore. The only time I game extensively was/is when Id play multiplayer with my kids.\n\nI recently dabbled in emulation on my phone (used to do a lot of emulation on PC) and just wasn't satisfied and that's when I started looking into Handheld PCs. I've always been a major handheld fan since childhood when my father got me the DMG Gameboy and I've had always been into Nintendo and Sony handhelds. And I've always loved the probability and coziness and playing a handheld and I think that's what I needed, to cozy up and be comfortable.\n\nI was dead set on getting a used Ally Z1E then doing the upgraded battery mod because I thought that was the best bang for my budget of $300-$375 and then the other day a listing for a Steam Deck OLED 512GB was listed on FB Marketplace (talked to the guy and he was a passionate gamer so I had confidence it wasn't a scam or a stolen device) so I shot an offer for $300. THIS. WAS. THE. BEST. GAMING. PURCHASE. IVE. MADE. IN. A. LONG. TIME. I've only had the Deck for a few days, downloaded a few games from my steam library first day and actually have been playing games and making progress and it doesn't feel like a chore! I've played at home in the evenings after the kids go to bed and taken it to work to play on breaks and I've put a good amount of game time in and haven't felt that blah feeling I've had. Still setting up emulators so I'm excited to have that on hand as well!\n\nSo this has been the best purchase on top of the steam community and cozy gaming community has been nothing but positive, welcoming and amazing!\n\n",

I PASSED AND GOT IT. I opted to get the Steam Oled 1tb and OMG has it been a GAME CHANGER!!! The redditors here were NOT lying.

Big thank you to everyone whose always active and up to helping new steam deck users with advice ranging from decky plugins all the way to modding and emulating.\n\nI can say for certain my gaming life is back on and i‚Äôm so happy about it, i‚Äôm no longer a robot slaving away in the clinic all day everyday without enjoying what I used to before medical school!\n\nThank you to everyone who makes this space an awesome one! \n",

Gotten quite far (chapter 5) but essentially I'm getting bored again it's just a massive fetch quest, with long cut scenes let's be honest. Although I am compelled to keep going. I'm not hating it but I'm some what addicted.\n\nSo again I'm sitting here with my steam deck holding forwards and walking through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape and my mind is wondering. I kinda want play a bit of street fighter 6. But I know if I stop playing Death Stranding there's a really big chance I might not come back to it for months. So I keep walking forwards, almost begrudgingly.\n\nThinking back to NMS, I can't remember what I was doing and what I planning to do next. If I boot that up again it might as well be someone else's save. So i probably need to start again. I was about 30 or 40 hours in. That would be the 3rd time I've started NMS again.\n\nThe list goes further back. Death Loop, Disco Elysium (started that around 4 times!), factorio, Dave the diver (I'm almost at the end and then I suddenly dropped it), dredge, elden ring, Kingdom come deliverance, jedi survivor. The last game I finished was Prey, which was excellent.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? What do you do? I wonder if it's worth keeping a game diary but honestly it seems like a lot of effort and kinda overkill for a casual endeavor. I don't have ADHD or anything...I don't think.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "The biggest selling point for purchasing my Steam Deck was the promise of quality gyro aiming in any game I wanted through \"Steam Inputs\" that the device can reasonably support. The Deck, has not disappointed in that regard. It has made so many action shooters I've played on the platform so fun! Regardless, if I played it for the 1st time or 100th time. Offering significantly better aiming experiences in these titles than they originally ever had with a controller before. While not needing any aim assist. Including a lot of the older ones. Though, the newer shooters benefit just as much. I'd even argue it is more immersive and satisfying as well.\n\n \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), has be been no exception. Just thought I'd share one of the biggest reasons why I love my Steam Deck with the community. How much of a game changer this feature has been for me personally. People give Nintendo all the praise for gyro controls. However, it's my opinion, Valve, is leading the way with the Steam Deck and Steam Inputs. As they support the feature fully and keep it updated. Making sure people actually have consistent, quality, fundamental access to it. Offering quality experiences. Valve, seems to understand gyro aims value. Which is awesome! Something the other major gaming platforms are still very far behind in unfortunately. It's not even close. \n\nI love this thing! \n\n[Steam Deck] [Gyro Aim] [Tomb Raider 2013] [No Aim Assist]",

So, about a month ago, I caved. I saw one on Facebook, and someone was selling a brand new OLED model for $425 and I just had to get it. Ever since that day, I have been addicted. \n\nI take it almost everywhere I go, work, school, but mostly I‚Äôm sitting with my girlfriend on the couch or in bed and we are just doing our own things, and it is bliss. \n\nI‚Äôve been buying more indie games to play as it fits so well with the console, and I‚Äôve been catching up on games that I‚Äôve stopped playing.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still play games on my PC, but now it‚Äôs different; I actually WANT to play games again. There‚Äôs just something so nice about being able to play what I want no matter where I am. With the expansion of it being a computer too, I can emulate games or just tinker with my system, opening a whole new world of things I can do. \n\nSo, if you can, get a steam deck. It might just spark your love for gaming again. ",

I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

    "selftext": "\n\nHi this my (new to me) Steam Deck OLED 512GB I got used. I decided to get a Steam Deck after debating for about 2 months (doing research during that time for the best handheld.\n\nI decided to this because I'm a 39 yr old dad of 2 teenagers and life is just so busy to sit in front of my PC to play anymore. I've been in a rut because I haven't been really able to play video games like I used to in a few years. I've played videos games since I was 5 and played a lot in my teens and 20s up to my early 30s.\n\nFor the past few years when I go to play a game, I'll open the game for less than 5 minutes and just don't have the motivation or energy to play or when I would force myself to play extensively, gaming felt like a real chore. The only time I game extensively was/is when Id play multiplayer with my kids.\n\nI recently dabbled in emulation on my phone (used to do a lot of emulation on PC) and just wasn't satisfied and that's when I started looking into Handheld PCs. I've always been a major handheld fan since childhood when my father got me the DMG Gameboy and I've had always been into Nintendo and Sony handhelds. And I've always loved the probability and coziness and playing a handheld and I think that's what I needed, to cozy up and be comfortable.\n\nI was dead set on getting a used Ally Z1E then doing the upgraded battery mod because I thought that was the best bang for my budget of $300-$375 and then the other day a listing for a Steam Deck OLED 512GB was listed on FB Marketplace (talked to the guy and he was a passionate gamer so I had confidence it wasn't a scam or a stolen device) so I shot an offer for $300. THIS. WAS. THE. BEST. GAMING. PURCHASE. IVE. MADE. IN. A. LONG. TIME. I've only had the Deck for a few days, downloaded a few games from my steam library first day and actually have been playing games and making progress and it doesn't feel like a chore! I've played at home in the evenings after the kids go to bed and taken it to work to play on breaks and I've put a good amount of game time in and haven't felt that blah feeling I've had. Still setting up emulators so I'm excited to have that on hand as well!\n\nSo this has been the best purchase on top of the steam community and cozy gaming community has been nothing but positive, welcoming and amazing!\n\n",

I also have quite the backlog on Steam, and I've heard the Deck is great for burning through your backlog. I'm also interested in getting into emulation of older/retro games, since I feel I missed out on a lot of them from not gaming much as a kid.\n\nSo basically, do you think the Steam Deck would be worth it for me?",

I PASSED AND GOT IT. I opted to get the Steam Oled 1tb and OMG has it been a GAME CHANGER!!! The redditors here were NOT lying. It‚Äôs so seamless straight out the box i‚Äôve been spamming portal 1 (the picture up top shows the end credits) portal 2, Brotato and Hades and have been having the time of my life during my study breaks whenever I decide to take them after a good 4 hours study session. \n\nI pulled the trigger on this purchase due to all the positive feedback on this sub reddit. Big thank you to everyone whose always active and up to helping new steam deck users with advice ranging from decky plugins all the way to modding and emulating.\n\nI can say for certain my gaming life is back on and i‚Äôm so happy about it, i‚Äôm no longer a robot slaving away in the clinic all day everyday without enjoying what I used to before medical school!\n\nThank you to everyone who makes this space an awesome one! \n",

Hydraulics/control won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äî my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30√ó1.5?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss‚ÜíM30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you‚Äôve used?\n\nWhat I‚Äôve tried / extra info:\n\t‚Ä¢\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this?

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "[](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZigBee/?f=flair_name%3A%22help%20request%22)Hi everyone! This is a follow up post to one I made a few days ago. I'm trying to come up with a way to use a bluetooth (not wifi) thermometer/hygrometer and connect it to a pc (windows). I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

For busy professionals, that‚Äôs the point. We don‚Äôt want to replace cooking we just want to make it less stressful. If tech can make homemade food easier to pull off after a 10-hour workday + I get to go to the gym, imagine the daily impact of that in the long run and tbhh that‚Äôs a win in my book",

The property uses lake-drawn water and has power year-round. Internet will be through AT&T Air, with the option to add a small battery backup for the router if needed. Temps will be below freezing for months on end I'm guessing\n\nI‚Äôd like to track:\n\n* indoor temperature in the cabin\n* temperature in the outbuildings, especially the pump house\n* water temperature coming in from the lake\n* a few leak sensors around plumbing\n\nI‚Äôve been looking at YoLink, since it seems to check those boxes, but I‚Äôd love to hear from people who know this space well.  There are so many options - admittedly a bit overwhelmed.\n\n1. Would you recommend YoLink for this type of setup?\n2. If not, what systems would you consider instead, and is there anything I should plan for early on?\n\nThanks in advance for the help ‚Äî really appreciate the collective expertise here.\n\nEdit: Added that it's in an area that freezes - that's the concern :D ",

    "selftext": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI'd like to share my open-source project **Proxmox-GitOps**, a Container Automation platform for provisioning and orchestrating Linux containers (LXC) on Proxmox VE - encapsulated as comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\n**Proxmox-GitOps (@Github)**: [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps)\n¬†\n* **Demo** (~1m): [https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY](https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY)\n\n* **Demo** (low, no ads): [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif)\n\n\n**TL;DR**: By encapsulating infrastructure within an extensible monorepository - recursively resolved from Git submodules at runtime - Proxmox-GitOps provides a comprehensive Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) abstraction for an entire, automated, container-based infrastructure.\n\nOriginally, it was a personal attempt to bring industrial automation and cloud patterns to my Proxmox home server. It's designed as a platform architecture for a self-contained, bootstrappable system - a generic IaC abstraction (customize, extend, .. open standards, base package only, .. - you name it üòâ) that automates the entire infrastructure. It was initially driven by the question of what a Proxmox-based GitOps automation could look like and how it could be organized.\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Recursive Self-management**: Control plane seeds itself by pushing its monorepository onto a locally bootstrapped instance, triggering a pipeline that recursively provisions the control plane onto PVE.\n\n* **Monorepository**: Centralizes infrastructure as comprehensive IaC artifact (for mirroring, like the project itself on Github) using submodules for modular composition.\n\n* **Git as State**: Git repository represents the desired infrastructure state.\n\n* **Loose coupling**: Containers are decoupled from the control plane, enabling runtime replacement and independent operation.\n\nOver the past few months, the project stabilized, and I‚Äôve addressed many questions you had in Wiki, summarized to documentation, which should now covers essential technical, conceptual, and practical aspects. I‚Äôve also added a short demo that breaks down the theory by demonstrating the automation of an IaC stack (Home Assistant, Mosquitto bridge, Zigbee2MQTT broker, snapshot restore, reverse proxy, dynamically configured via PVE API), with automated container system updates and service checks.\n\n**What am I looking for?** It's a noncommercial, passion-driven project. I'm looking to collaborate with other engineers who share the excitement of building a self-contained, bootstrappable platform architecture that addresses the question: What should our home automation look like?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!",

    "selftext": "Last year, I installed a k-type thermocouple in my wood stove flue pipe. Coupled with an esp8266, it's let me keep track of stove temperatures and helped optimize burns (when to cut back primary air, when to reload, etc). As a result, last week when I cleaned the chimney for the season, I had virtually no creosote build up.  I had set up some simple notifications to our phones like over fire when temp > 800F and reload when temp < 250F, but it was a bit of a pain to pull my phone out throughout the night to keep tabs on the stove. Tonight, I mapped the temperature reading to a hue value on the hue/sat color wheel and setup an automation to gradually adjust a virtually unused wyze color bulb in the corner for a visual stove temperature indication. After burn #1 with it in place, I'm pretty satisfied! Blue = cold, green = target, red = hot. With the hue mapping, color gradually adjusts every 30s in small increments throughout the burn.\n\n  \nFull write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/)\n\nAnd original stove monitoring write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/)",

    "title": "My impression of SmartWings shades",
    "selftext": "The other day I got into a convo wth another Redditor who asked in this sub some specifics about SmartWings shades. I bought some earlier this year for a couple of the bedrooms and then installed a set in my home office yesterday, so I thought I would write a longer review.\n\nMy smarthome setup consists of Google Home, a Hubitat hub, and primarily Z-Wave Plus products. All of my SmartWings shades have Z-Wave Plus motors. In the bedrooms I installed 90% blackout Zebra shades. Yesterday I installed a 70% blackout woven wood roller shade in my home office.\n\nWhen ordering there's a good bit of information to fill in and a number of choices to make, so be sure to allow yourself a sufficient block of time. The fabric colors are clearly outlined but it's not always easy to make a proper comparison from a PC or phone. You can order a book of fabric samples, which I did prior to placing my second order.\n\nThe measuring instructions are clear and there's no need to overcompensate for anything. I added the minimum suggested amount to the window length and the side blackout works great. For the Zebra shade height I overcompensated and ended up having to mount the Zebra shades higher than originally planned because the bedroom window sills jut out a bit. The Zebra shades have to be mounted at an exact height so that the fabric lines up correctly when the shade is fully closed.  If there's no obstruction like a window sill then that won't really matter, but in my case it did and I measured too long, That was user error on my part. Just measure the window height and add the suggested amount for the mounts. There's no need to add any length past that.\n\nShipping takes a few weeks since they come from China. Once the order is marked as in transit, the shipment arrives within a few days.\n\nInstallation is easy, unless you measure too long like I did. :D There are a handful of brackets to install for the Zebra shades, and if you order an outside mount like I did, there are extenders to install as well. The woven wood shade that I ordered recently is even easier to install, with brackets only and a top-down connection. I recommend having an installation buddy for any blind wider than a single window. The blinds aren't heavy but if lengthy they can be unwieldy to hold solo.\n\nConnecting to the home network is easy, requiring only the app for your hub and the appropriate PIN or ID for the device.\n\nI didn't get the solar chargers on any of the blinds, figuring I would just charge them as needed. Thus far I've only had to charge the bedroom blinds twice in 8 months. \n\nI've been highly satisfied with the blinds in the bedrooms, and the newly installed woven wood shade in my office is working great as well.  These blinds are on the pricier side but the quality is excellent and the setup is easy.\n\nOne other note: at first I was using my ADT alarm system as the hub and not Hubitat.  Google Home wouldn't recognize the blinds even though they had been added to ADT successfully. Of ADT, Google, and SmartWings, only the SmartWings customer service rep seemed to have any clue a to what was going on. ADT's response was \"sorry we don't sell that product so I can't help you.\" Google customer support told me to disconnect and reconnect ADT even though I plainly told them that I'd already tried that, and when it still didn't work they said \"oh that's too bad thanks bye.\" Ha. The SmartWings chat rep listened to what was going on and correctly suspected that the ADT controller wasn't properly communicating the presence of the blinds with Google Home. They recommended that I switch my hub to either Google Hub or one of their other supported hubs. I went with Hubitat and now it all works great.\n\nBottom line, SmartWings are solid and easy to set up smart blinds.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I‚Äôm under contract for a new home and will gain access in a couple of weeks. I‚Äôm feeling a tiny bit overwhelmed. I have what I would consider above average tech skills. I‚Äôm a software engineer by trade writing web apps, and I first learned to code on Arduino over a decade ago so I have decent programming and cursory electronics skills (I could install a WiFi relay or something of similar complexity without help). I used to have my whole place set up with WiFi bulbs and a WiFi thermostat connected to google home and do enjoy the benefits of smart home features (though WiFi bulbs were kind of a pain and I‚Äôm excited to control things at the switch instead). \n\nI‚Äôm interested in designing a home automation system throughout the home that far exceeds what I‚Äôve been able to do previously as a renter. Part of that means I want to set up a network rack and run cat 6 cabling throughout the house. I want to make good choices early so I don‚Äôt have to upgrade later, but I‚Äôm having trouble deciding what that means for my project. \n\nThe house is a 4 story townhome in the the middle of a city so I do want some cameras and security features, but I don‚Äôt have a yard, just a 1 car garage. I think maybe having PoE run everywhere is the right way to do it? I have a little bit of an attention deficit and replacing batteries in a bunch of devices is a hassle. \n\nI also need a little advice on how to figure out what‚Äôs already been set up, the house has a Bluetooth speaker system throughout, and there were some digital intercom screens set up in a few rooms but they appeared to be turned off we did the tour/inspection. \n\nThere‚Äôs also the matter of hardware and software choices. I‚Äôve heard great things about the unifi ubiquiti platform and would like to try a nice network setup as a backbone for the project, and I‚Äôm excited to build on an open sourced platform like home assistant. I tried having a conversation with an LLM about hardware and some things like a dedicated firewall seem like overkill? It‚Äôs tough to right size a system without having seen common setups before.\n\nAll of these variables have led me into a bit of an analysis paralysis, I wanted to start home lab-ing a bit in preparation but can‚Äôt decide what parts of the project I can get a head start on or if I should just wait to get the keys. I feel if I wait too long to run the cat6 I might have to do it after our stuff is moved in making things a little harder (I have a month and a half or so of overlap to move), but I figure getting someone out here to do the work twice will cost more so I should figure out how many ports I‚Äôm going to have them drop quickly. \n\nMostly just looking for general advice, tips, or other experiences to learn from on how to properly design and diagram everything and come up with a semblance of a plan going into the new home. Help!",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all ‚Äî hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI‚Äôve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äî my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30√ó1.5?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss‚ÜíM30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you‚Äôve used?\n\nWhat I‚Äôve tried / extra info:\n\t‚Ä¢\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can‚Äôt figure out the chart :(",

I think this is my first time doing a post in the sub.\n\nI'm having a super hard time deciding what motor it's the best option for my two door garage, as I don't have space for the classic \"piston type\" motors, as they use at least 20cm per side once the door is open.\n\nI saw a short on youtube of a brazilian guy (I wasn't able to find it again :( ) using this kind of motors, meant for sheet metal door garages:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jggxvhuyo2wf1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6812395e5bd442077b53fa49e0c6db4f721c2a5\n\nMounted on the frame on top, one per door and using the button input of the boards for automation, I'm thinking I can use the builtin sensor input on one of the boards to avoid opening one before the other and on the one that needs to open first, a ESPHome or Tasmota as a bridge to my OpenHAB.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks in advance!",

So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all ‚Äî hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI‚Äôve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äî my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30√ó1.5?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss‚ÜíM30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you‚Äôve used?\n\nWhat I‚Äôve tried / extra info:\n\t‚Ä¢\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can‚Äôt figure out the chart :(",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

    "selftext": "I have a Somfy R550 R2 CMO motor hooked up to a retractable awning. It has physical stop settings, so the risk of overtravel is limited as long as those don't fail, but the motor switch is 3-position.\n\nIt's not 3-way: it's 3-position, that is, the up position goes clockwise, down goes counter-clockwise, and there's a middle neutral position that is off. A switch like that would have to have a very specific \"on\" time. Like, I should be able to tell it how long it takes to extend fully and program that time in seconds.\n\n  \nIs there any product that works well and integrates with the typical smart home hubs that would work? Right now, we have and really like Hue hub for our exterior lights and a way to hook this up to Hue would be awesome. What I'd like to avoid is another Wi-Fi-based switch with a proprietary app. I am pretty handy, but a plug-and-play switch is really all I'm willing to invest in for this project.",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up?

I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription.

The white on the left goes in to the relay (to trigger the central heating), and the white on the right goes from the relay to the boiler. The Black is permanent live to the boiler for hot water.\n\nThe second picture is using WAGO connecters instead of the standard connector, hot water works fine.\n\nThe third picture shows how the relay is wired (there's a piece that plugs in to connect and control).

Like, a smart switch at each far end, combined with a smart relay hidden behind the regular lighting panels of the other circuits. And when I hit either of the smart switches, the relays are all automated to turn on or off. \n\nIs that right?! What‚Äôs the best way to run such an automation?

It‚Äôs all been working fine through Home Assistant and Apple Home, but I‚Äôm starting to feel the mess of having multiple bridges and protocols.\n\nSo now I‚Äôm trying to go ‚ÄúMatter-only‚Äù as much as possible. My next step is replacing the IKEA Zigbee shades. I came across Bringnox blinds that natively support Matter and connect directly to Apple Home without a bridge, which sounds like a good fit for where I‚Äôm headed.\n\nHas anyone here gone through a similar migration ‚Äî especially with shades or blinds? Any tips on what works smoothly under Matter right now?",

I have two in my bedroom and have wanted to automate these with the rest of my set up for a really long time now, however I'm broke and can't afford to shell out $150 for something like this:  \n[https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP](https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP)\n\npersonally it makes 0 sense to me that a motor that rotates a blind would cost this much. Any suggestions that are more cost effective, or potentially anyone willing to sell something similar at a cheaper price? I'll still happily quote something fair.

However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

At times, I even get the message ‚ÄúUnable to load Favourites,‚Äù although they were initially visible.\n* No error messages, no logs, no response from Amazon.\n* After switching to a different Alexa account, the same issues reappear after a while.\n\nI suspect a cloud-side issue, since the behavior is identical across multiple devices and persists even after reinstalling the app. Other users have reported similar bugs ‚Äî some going back weeks.\n\nAnd this is still the ‚Äúold‚Äù Alexa ‚Äî what‚Äôs coming our way with Alexa+?\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced the same?\n* Are there any workarounds (e.g., via the web interface or voice commands)?\n* Has anyone tried bypassing the Alexa app entirely by creating a new, empty Alexa account and using Echo devices just as microphones/speakers for Home Assistant?\n* Has anyone received a meaningful response from Amazon support?",

If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

    "selftext": "At boot, you're greeted with the familiar \"please install an operating system on your hard disk\" message, so I assumed some sort of OS or HDD malfunction, but it goes beyond that. When I attempted to troubleshoot it, I quickly found out the computer won't boot from ANYTHING, no HDD, no DVD, no USB, doesn't matter if Legacy or UEFI either (my main concern is UEFI but I did turn off secure boot and enabled Legacy for the sake of testing). To be more specific, is not that booting causes an error, no device itself gets detected on the boot menu. And yes, this is across multiple USBs and DVDs, from OS installers to diagnostic utilities, both Legacy and UEFI.\n\nI eventually went into the Bios and found that all the boot devices are being properly detected in the bios under storage, so no faulty devices or ports, however, going into the boot options I think I see the issue, I found out that under \"boot order\" there's two options : UEFI Boot sources and Legacy Boot sources, both of them were disabled. I can simply enable them then save changes and exit BIOS, problem is, the changes won't save, next boot there's still no boot sources detected and going into the bios shows that both options are disabled again. Resetting the BIOS by removing the CMOS battery doesn't change this, fresh boot after doing so just shows both of them still disabled, still not saving. If I do other changes within the BIOS, they do persist (like say, disabling secure boot), but not the boot sources option. I figured it may be a corrupt BIOS so I wanted to try updating it, but there's no HP support page for this model at all, it just acknowledges that the model exists and has a picture of it, but no drivers, software, manuals, etc.\n\nI'm pretty much ready to blame this on the BIOS/Motherboard, just posting here in the off chance somebody may have ran into something similar before. Is there such a thing as a BIOS corruption that still POSTs and works seemingly normal except for one specific option? User of device had nothing useful to say, just that they turned it off for the weekend then came back today and found it like this.\n\nThanks for reading this far.",

    "selftext": "I live in Narowal, Pakistan, a small area about three hours away from Lahore. It is more like a village, with almost no tech awareness, no tech companies, and very few opportunities for a teenager to get motivated or do something meaningful. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree from Virtual University, and my CGPA is around 2.\n\nI started my tech journey when I was 17 with [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io), a no-code platform that allows people to build full web apps without traditional coding. I worked on it for about a year and a half with a friend. He was freelancing, and I was the one doing all the work behind the scenes. We did not have a company or anything official. I was just building and learning on my own.\n\nAfter some time, I started to feel empty because all my skills and focus were revolving around just one platform. I realized that Bubble jobs are very limited, and with how fast LLMs and tools like Loveable are advancing, low-code platforms could easily be replaced. I was 18 at that point and decided to move from low-code to actual coding.\n\nI began learning Python because I really wanted to become a backend engineer. But after a month, I saw the market boom for the MERN stack, so I switched to that. I worked hard to learn full-stack JavaScript, but I could not break into the market. There is so much competition, and most companies prefer top-tier university graduates. At that time, I was still in my second year of university, so I eventually left after three to four months in MERN.\n\nThen, I turned to Machine Learning, seeing its rapid growth and thrilling potential for the future. I felt very excited learning it and enjoyed exploring how far I could go in this field. This was the first time I truly felt alive again. I revised Python, started learning linear algebra, and felt like I had finally found my path.\n\nBut recently, I heard advice saying that it is better to become a software engineer first before diving into Machine Learning because software engineering jobs are easier to find, especially in Pakistan. That completely threw me off, and my mind went blank again.\n\nNow, I am standing at a crossroads, questioning everything. Should I change my direction for the fourth time? I have been switching paths since I was 18, and now I am almost 20, with only five months left. I just wanted to build a professional skill before my 20s, but I believe Allah has better plans for me.\n\nMy mind is completely blank. Please, I need honest advice. I am all ears and would really appreciate any comment that could help me feel more confident about my path.",

After a minute of just waiting, the PC automatically restarts itself. Just wanna mention that this is more or so random whenever it happens so it is kind of hard to diagnose. I also monitored the usage of the wattage on every single part in my PC and it never spikes above 400w even during gaming or benchmarking (i have a 650W PSU). If it helps, i do keep getting a kernel 41 whenever the PC freezes after i restart (which doesn't say much unfortunately).\n\nThings that i have already tried doing that didn't fix my issue:  \nReinstalling windows  \nUpdating my BIOS (also loaded the MSI optimised defaults by pressing F7)  \nUnplugging and re-plugging all of my display cables once the PC freezes                                                   Turning off hardware acceleration in windows.                                                                                      Disabling XMP\n\nSpecs:  \nH610M-G (not the best motherboard in the world for a 600KF chip but it worked fine for the first two weeks even on full load)  \n16x2 Kingston Fury Beast 3200mhz CL16  \n4060  \nA650GL  \n2 NVMe drives  \n1 SATA SSD  \n1 2.5 inch HDD\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

He uses it with two monitors for work - so one may have a brower or possibly a video, and the other Excel or Word. There is no gaming or anything like that. The laptop may be 9 years old or thereabouts. \n\nHe's had issues with the monitors connecting and it seems like anything plugged into the mini display port isn't now detected, but the HDMI out is working. He's ordered a cheap cable but who knows if this is the issue. (He's flipped the monitors around and they both seem OK.)\n\nAnyway, I think he'd be better off with a single large monitor (32 inches maybe) but my question is what resolution has could get from his laptop. Splitting a large window with 1,920 x 1,080 output seems horrible to me, so I think he'd want 2560 x 1440. If I Google the graphics card then it seems it can cope with 4k, but there seems some uncertainty - but this just be for gaming on 4k. Not sure!\n\nIf his laptop could cope then getting a 2560 x 1440 (not 4k) monitor seems like a good option but would it work?",

    "selftext": "I know this is not a new issue. I've seen fixes to the issue here. None resolved it for me.\n\nThis is a what I've done:  \n\\-Disabled fast startup¬†\n\n\\-Turned off PCI Express>Link State Power Management\n\n\\-Set the Power Button to shut down option\n\n\\-Disabled the Hiberboot\n\n\\-Disabled the Start and Recovery Automatically restart option\n\nWhat I am not able to do:\n\n\\-When I go to Winlogon, the is no Power Down - Shut down option. I have not added one by regedit.\n\n\\-When I open Network adapter to select it to not to power the system on, there is no power tab option. My system is Modern Standby, so Power tabs are not present. I can edit the registry to put the system to S3 and return the power options. What I've found out online is SO alone would not be the cause for a restart after shut down\n\nI have run both a DISM and sfc /scannow. No corrupt files were found.\n\nMy computer was purchased this September 2025. For the first two weeks, there was not an issue The only cause I could think of is a Windows update done about two weeks ago. I haven't uninstalled those yet and have had an update since. The issue was not rectified.\n\nThe computer runs fine in every other function. I suppose I could do a reinstall of Windows 11, but it doesn't seem worth the effort.\n\nAny input would be welcome.\n\nTYIA\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hii,\n\nMy PC generally has a problem where i need to restart my ethernet adapter once in a while. That's alright. But the issue comes when i go to the diagnose network problems tab - it claims my pc time is inaccurate. I'm in CEST, location is set, automatically set time.. everything. When it is 9pm, the PC shows correctly that it is 9 pm. This came all of a sudden, and lets me no longer restart the ethernet adapter from the diagnose network problems tab.. but also synching the time does nothing. So i press the sync now to sync my perfectly correct time.. and it still says its inaccurate. ",

    "selftext": "Hi I'm using an iphone 16 pro (relatively new, got it as a gift in August but it might've been second hand). My front camera almost never works for face verification purposes (and never has since the day I got it). It works on the camera app, on Snapchat, Instagram etc. But only when I need live face verification does the front camera stop working, regardless of platform. Back camera works for ID verifications etc but not the front. I can't transfer money on my banking app because of this. typically where it says to put my face in the circle, the space where it should show myself is completely black or an error code shows up. Setting up the faceid in settings I managed to set it up without being able to see myself, the phone could see me but wasn't showing me myself. On apps like NatWest it's completely black with no error but it also doesn't manage to recognise me. On other apps it'll give me an error and won't let me continue. Strangely on one singular app it actually did work. I'm not sure what's going on. I can provide screenshots if necessary",

I've tried running malware detectors on her device but whatever the issue is, it's not coming up on those either.

    "selftext": "My PC (windows) has crashed **multiple** times without a BSOD just a plain power crash like I turned the power off and just stopped turning on when touching the power cable, banging on the desk etc. The first time it happened I bought a replacement PSU. That was the first thing I thought happened: The PSU died. Then it happened last night, I didnt want to buy another replacement so I tried a different, maybe outdated power cable, but then! It turned on! The RGB turned on out of nowhere and I just ignored it. Until it happened again after I accidentally touched the power outlet below my feet. I recall not touching the power cable directly but just the outlet or my monitor cable. First I thought it was RAM that wasn't seated in the slot properly. but it seems to be alright. Then I checked my motherboard and it seems to be more unfastened than usual. I press on the CPU cooler and it pushes the motherboard with it. I don't think its a problem with the motherboard being unfastened on one side though. Can someone please help. I really don't want to buy a replacement PSU again. To summarize: PC crash, no BSOD, doesnt turn on.",

    "selftext": "My PC was dropped once (the hardware behind the screen took the hit), so one of the screws in the case broke.\nTo remove the broken screw, I opened the case ‚Äî and while I was at it, I decided to check the thermal paste. It was completely dry, so I thought, ‚ÄúBetter scrape it off than leave it like this.‚Äù\nAfter scraping it off, the problems started. The computer would boot normally, but after about a minute, the fans would speed up, and shortly after, the screen would go completely black.\n\nSo I bought some new thermal paste. However (most likely while I was replacing it), one of the yellow-and-black wires from the 4-pin connector snapped off. I didn‚Äôt notice it at first ‚Äî after applying the new paste, the PC wouldn‚Äôt power on anymore. It only spun the fans at a constant speed, but nothing else would happen.\n\nLater I noticed that one of those 4-pin wires had come loose. I soldered it back, but nothing changed. Then I replaced it with another cable with about the same wire thickness. After that, the PSU started making a buzzing noise and then completely died.\n\nNow, even with a different PSU, the problem continues ‚Äî in fact, the fans spin even slower now. The replacement PSU is older but stronger, and I tested it yesterday with another device, and it worked fine, so the issue isn‚Äôt the new PSU.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n(Also, I didn‚Äôt use any custom cables ‚Äî I‚Äôm using the ones that came with the power supply itself.)\nAlso I used ChatGPT to translate because it's really hard to translate this whole story",

    "selftext": "This isn‚Äôt exactly a tech support problem, more of a curiosity thing.\n\nI have an Asus K6502ZC with a Core i5-12450H and a mobile RTX 3050 4 GB. The laptop shipped with a single PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe drive. I installed a second PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe, and GPU-Z shows the RTX 3050 running at PCIe 4.0 x8. Even after removing the second NVMe drive, GPU-Z still reports the GPU at x8 Gen4 (even in GPU-Z render test).\n\nFrom what I understand, the 12450H has 28 PCIe lanes, which should be enough for a x16 dGPU plus a x4 NVMe, with lanes to spare. I‚Äôm not sure how the CPU and PCH are wired in this model, but I expected the dGPU to run at x16.\n\nMy question: is the mobile RTX 3050 in the K6502ZC permanently wired for PCIe 4.0 x8 regardless of storage configuration, or is there another reason it stays at x8 even with only one NVMe installed?\n\nPerformance isn‚Äôt the concern here, I know a mobile 3050 won‚Äôt saturate x16, a mobile 3050 will still suck. I‚Äôm just trying to understand why it reports x8 Gen4 regardless of whether the second NVMe is installed. Is the GPU wired as x8 by design on this model, or is there something else going on with lane allocation/power states?",

As per the logs there is no temperature hotspots, I have also repasted CPU, cleaned fans and even repasted the GPU.\n\nSome additional observations :\n\n* The issue tends to happen during AAA Gaming. I completed Silksong and Hades 2, and didn't face a single crash.\n* The issue also tends to resolve itself for a month or two, and there is no crash at all.\n* When the issue does show up, it is consistent. Post a crash restart, I can boot into the game and it will crash after minutes (even during non trivial screens like level up menu)\n* Keeping the PC off for a day or two, alleviates the issue for a little bit. This is could be just incidental or wrong observation.\n\nMy best guess is it is due to the power draw, though not sure how to check that in HWInfo. I believe the issue might have started after upgrading from 5600X to 5900X. Though its hard to be sure, and I don't believe my setup should exceed the 750w Draw during gaming.\n\nThe other might be related to static build up, but again it should also cause crash during idle. My PC tends to be on 24x7 for Jellyfin and laziness, so it should have been noticed then.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, since this has driven me insane over the past year.",

Pc worked great but over the years I'd gained many many files and wanted to reset it all and wipe it to start fresh. \n\nwhen I went home over the summer (I'm a uni student) I got my dad (who initially built the pc) to reset it for me and install windows 11 (a dodgy pirate key because he doesn't believe in paying for anything and doesn't value my opinions) Ever since the reset everything has gone down hill. \n\nIt started with the PC just being really slow and freezing for 10-15 seconds and as time went on I started getting crashes and my PC booting up and saying oops there is an issue. \n\nI've only just started learning about PCs this last year because of my uni course and doing stuff myself but this is everything I've done to try fix it in order. \n\n-- Unplugged all extensions and plugged in stuff - turned off pc and removed power cable - left for ten minutes - turned back on and slowly added back all the extensions and plugins like dongles. \n\n-- Uninstalled the dodgy windows and got an actual key (on sale cause I'm a broke student) \n\n-- Checked my pc physically to ensure everything was connected correctly and no hardware had become loose (as I moved accommodation) \n\n-- Windows failed to access my account after a fault so I lost everything so I did a system restore to get everyback \n\n-- Total reset with removing files which took all this weekend --- (Pc so far hasn't crashed since but is very slow) \n\n-- Ensured all windows updates were installed and checked that all drivers (CPU & GPU mainly) were up to date \n\nSince the total reset I've had no crashes or problems booting up the pc but some apps just won't open and even opening the settings takes 10 years and freezes. I have no idea what to do at this point and I am in desperate need of my PC for uni as I'm a games student. \n\nSpecifications \n\nCPU - AMD Ryzen 5 3500X 6-Core Processor (3.59 GHz)\n\nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (4GB)\n\nRAM - 16GB \n\nI am hoping to upgrade my CPU as I realise my build is out of date but I have to wait for Christmas to hopefully get some money towards it. GPU is gonna get upgraded when I can save enough. \n\nUPDATE: Looking at my system info its saying I have 0GB of storage? if this is the issue I currently have no idea how to fix this and I am currently frantically Googling.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read my plea for help and any advice is greatly appreciated.

How do I fix this? It‚Äôs extremely annoying having to use data, especially when I don‚Äôt have good connection in buildings.",

    "title": "HP Envy 750-124 Desktop, won't boot from ANY source, UEFI or Legacy",
    "selftext": "At boot, you're greeted with the familiar \"please install an operating system on your hard disk\" message, so I assumed some sort of OS or HDD malfunction, but it goes beyond that. When I attempted to troubleshoot it, I quickly found out the computer won't boot from ANYTHING, no HDD, no DVD, no USB, doesn't matter if Legacy or UEFI either (my main concern is UEFI but I did turn off secure boot and enabled Legacy for the sake of testing). To be more specific, is not that booting causes an error, no device itself gets detected on the boot menu. And yes, this is across multiple USBs and DVDs, from OS installers to diagnostic utilities, both Legacy and UEFI.\n\nI eventually went into the Bios and found that all the boot devices are being properly detected in the bios under storage, so no faulty devices or ports, however, going into the boot options I think I see the issue, I found out that under \"boot order\" there's two options : UEFI Boot sources and Legacy Boot sources, both of them were disabled. I can simply enable them then save changes and exit BIOS, problem is, the changes won't save, next boot there's still no boot sources detected and going into the bios shows that both options are disabled again. Resetting the BIOS by removing the CMOS battery doesn't change this, fresh boot after doing so just shows both of them still disabled, still not saving. If I do other changes within the BIOS, they do persist (like say, disabling secure boot), but not the boot sources option. I figured it may be a corrupt BIOS so I wanted to try updating it, but there's no HP support page for this model at all, it just acknowledges that the model exists and has a picture of it, but no drivers, software, manuals, etc.\n\nI'm pretty much ready to blame this on the BIOS/Motherboard, just posting here in the off chance somebody may have ran into something similar before. Is there such a thing as a BIOS corruption that still POSTs and works seemingly normal except for one specific option? User of device had nothing useful to say, just that they turned it off for the weekend then came back today and found it like this.\n\nThanks for reading this far.",

You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. Also one or more ISR routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. At least one detected problem appears to be network related. In case you are using a WLAN adapter, try disabling it to get better results. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup. Check for BIOS updates. \n\nLatencyMon has been analyzing your system for  0:02:22  (h:mm:ss) on all processors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSYSTEM INFORMATION\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nComputer name:                                        JV\n\nOS version:                                           Windows 11, 10.0, version 2009, build: 26200 (x64)\n\nHardware:                                             MS-7C75, Micro-Star International Co., Ltd.\n\nBIOS:                                                 A.E0\n\nCPU:                                                  GenuineIntel Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400 CPU @ 2.90GHz\n\nLogical processors:                                   12\n\nProcessor groups:                                     1\n\nProcessor group size:                                 12\n\nRAM:                                                  16305 MB total\n\n\n\n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nCPU SPEED\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nReported CPU speed (WMI):                             2904 MHz\n\nReported CPU speed (registry):                        2904 MHz\n\n\n\nNote: reported execution times may be calculated based on a fixed reported CPU speed.

    "selftext": "I live in Narowal, Pakistan, a small area about three hours away from Lahore. It is more like a village, with almost no tech awareness, no tech companies, and very few opportunities for a teenager to get motivated or do something meaningful. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree from Virtual University, and my CGPA is around 2.\n\nI started my tech journey when I was 17 with [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io), a no-code platform that allows people to build full web apps without traditional coding. I worked on it for about a year and a half with a friend. He was freelancing, and I was the one doing all the work behind the scenes. We did not have a company or anything official. I was just building and learning on my own.\n\nAfter some time, I started to feel empty because all my skills and focus were revolving around just one platform. I realized that Bubble jobs are very limited, and with how fast LLMs and tools like Loveable are advancing, low-code platforms could easily be replaced. I was 18 at that point and decided to move from low-code to actual coding.\n\nI began learning Python because I really wanted to become a backend engineer. But after a month, I saw the market boom for the MERN stack, so I switched to that. I worked hard to learn full-stack JavaScript, but I could not break into the market. There is so much competition, and most companies prefer top-tier university graduates. At that time, I was still in my second year of university, so I eventually left after three to four months in MERN.\n\nThen, I turned to Machine Learning, seeing its rapid growth and thrilling potential for the future. I felt very excited learning it and enjoyed exploring how far I could go in this field. This was the first time I truly felt alive again. I revised Python, started learning linear algebra, and felt like I had finally found my path.\n\nBut recently, I heard advice saying that it is better to become a software engineer first before diving into Machine Learning because software engineering jobs are easier to find, especially in Pakistan. That completely threw me off, and my mind went blank again.\n\nNow, I am standing at a crossroads, questioning everything. Should I change my direction for the fourth time? I have been switching paths since I was 18, and now I am almost 20, with only five months left. I just wanted to build a professional skill before my 20s, but I believe Allah has better plans for me.\n\nMy mind is completely blank. Please, I need honest advice. I am all ears and would really appreciate any comment that could help me feel more confident about my path.",

However, I cannot find this option anywhere. I am only presented with options to pay monthly or annually, or to 'upgrade' (give me strength) to premium or family.\n\nHave they got rid of Classic?\n\n\n\n\n",

Pages take long time loading, teleporting in games. Bugs and glitches, for example when I play a multiplayer game, my mic randomly stops working from anywhere from 10 seconds to 60 seconds and then it works fine again.   \n  \nI dont know what to do. I have tried resetting network settings, updating my game drivers but nothing is working. When I do speed tests i have 500/500 so the internet is solid \n\nI am lost at this point, and it is getting really annoying to deal with. Please help anyone<3\n\n",

    "selftext": "At boot, you're greeted with the familiar \"please install an operating system on your hard disk\" message, so I assumed some sort of OS or HDD malfunction, but it goes beyond that. When I attempted to troubleshoot it, I quickly found out the computer won't boot from ANYTHING, no HDD, no DVD, no USB, doesn't matter if Legacy or UEFI either (my main concern is UEFI but I did turn off secure boot and enabled Legacy for the sake of testing). To be more specific, is not that booting causes an error, no device itself gets detected on the boot menu. And yes, this is across multiple USBs and DVDs, from OS installers to diagnostic utilities, both Legacy and UEFI.\n\nI eventually went into the Bios and found that all the boot devices are being properly detected in the bios under storage, so no faulty devices or ports, however, going into the boot options I think I see the issue, I found out that under \"boot order\" there's two options : UEFI Boot sources and Legacy Boot sources, both of them were disabled. I can simply enable them then save changes and exit BIOS, problem is, the changes won't save, next boot there's still no boot sources detected and going into the bios shows that both options are disabled again. Resetting the BIOS by removing the CMOS battery doesn't change this, fresh boot after doing so just shows both of them still disabled, still not saving. If I do other changes within the BIOS, they do persist (like say, disabling secure boot), but not the boot sources option. I figured it may be a corrupt BIOS so I wanted to try updating it, but there's no HP support page for this model at all, it just acknowledges that the model exists and has a picture of it, but no drivers, software, manuals, etc.\n\nI'm pretty much ready to blame this on the BIOS/Motherboard, just posting here in the off chance somebody may have ran into something similar before. Is there such a thing as a BIOS corruption that still POSTs and works seemingly normal except for one specific option? User of device had nothing useful to say, just that they turned it off for the weekend then came back today and found it like this.\n\nThanks for reading this far.",

    "selftext": "I am working now on some small projects and I‚Äôm at the point where I need to figure out if a VPN or residential proxies would be better for what I‚Äôm doing. Basically, I‚Äôm running a sneaker bot for fun (not anything big, just trying to grab a pair here and there) and I also scrape some public data for personal research. I don‚Äôt want my IP getting blocked, but I also don‚Äôt want to overpay for something I barely use.\n\nI‚Äôve used a VPN before (mostly for streaming and privacy) and it worked fine, but I hear proxies can be a better choice if you need a bunch of IPs or less latency. I found some [residential proxies](https://infatica.io/residential-proxies/) online going for around $3 per IP, which seemed like a pretty good price, but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre reliable or if I‚Äôd get throttled.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience using both for this kind of stuff? Is it worth paying for residential proxies for small projects or should I just stick with a good VPN? I‚Äôm not super technical so I want something simple to set up too.",

    "selftext": "hya :3  \ni'm experiencing this problem/bug where i get these weird files on my sd card.  \nthey're very big (multiple gigabytes) and have names made up of seemingly random ascii characters. i can't delete them, move them or rename them, as it gives me an error saying \"the file name you specified is not valid or too long\".  \ni looked up solutions on how to delete them, but nothing seems to fit my specific case.  \nI belive they're just caused by the cheap sd card reader i'm using being faulty, as this already happened with the same reader.  \nThe only way i found to delete them was to format  the sd card, but i really don't wanna do that, for no other reason than it'd be a pain in the a.\n\ndoes anyone know what they are and how to get rid of them (if there's a way at all?)?",

    "selftext": "I live in Narowal, Pakistan, a small area about three hours away from Lahore. It is more like a village, with almost no tech awareness, no tech companies, and very few opportunities for a teenager to get motivated or do something meaningful. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree from Virtual University, and my CGPA is around 2.\n\nI started my tech journey when I was 17 with [Bubble.io](http://Bubble.io), a no-code platform that allows people to build full web apps without traditional coding. I worked on it for about a year and a half with a friend. He was freelancing, and I was the one doing all the work behind the scenes. We did not have a company or anything official. I was just building and learning on my own.\n\nAfter some time, I started to feel empty because all my skills and focus were revolving around just one platform. I realized that Bubble jobs are very limited, and with how fast LLMs and tools like Loveable are advancing, low-code platforms could easily be replaced. I was 18 at that point and decided to move from low-code to actual coding.\n\nI began learning Python because I really wanted to become a backend engineer. But after a month, I saw the market boom for the MERN stack, so I switched to that. I worked hard to learn full-stack JavaScript, but I could not break into the market. There is so much competition, and most companies prefer top-tier university graduates. At that time, I was still in my second year of university, so I eventually left after three to four months in MERN.\n\nThen, I turned to Machine Learning, seeing its rapid growth and thrilling potential for the future. I felt very excited learning it and enjoyed exploring how far I could go in this field. This was the first time I truly felt alive again. I revised Python, started learning linear algebra, and felt like I had finally found my path.\n\nBut recently, I heard advice saying that it is better to become a software engineer first before diving into Machine Learning because software engineering jobs are easier to find, especially in Pakistan. That completely threw me off, and my mind went blank again.\n\nNow, I am standing at a crossroads, questioning everything. Should I change my direction for the fourth time? I have been switching paths since I was 18, and now I am almost 20, with only five months left. I just wanted to build a professional skill before my 20s, but I believe Allah has better plans for me.\n\nMy mind is completely blank. Please, I need honest advice. I am all ears and would really appreciate any comment that could help me feel more confident about my path.",
