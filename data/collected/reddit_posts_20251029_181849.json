Right out of the box, inside the store, it wouldn’t connect to WiFi, it wouldn’t connect to 5G or LTE and it had to be connected via Ethernet. That phone had problems right out of the box and when we asked if we could get another phone that didn’t need to be connected via Ethernet for set up (while my mom had her iPhone 13 Pro out of the box set up beautifully with no extra support needed, they refused). \n\nJust now I got an Apple Pencil. Brand new. Off the Apple Store App. Engraved. And it only HALF works. It can click stuff. That’s it. It will not draw. \n\nOn procreate, the eraser works, smudge and paint don’t. On ArtStudio pro, nothing works. And on the iOS notes app, it draws. It was als\n\nMy really cheap $30 off brand “Apple” pencil works beautiful for everything though. \n\nI’ve reset the iPad, the pencil (forget this device), I’ve swapped out the Apple Pencil tips (official ones, even the bootleg one has an official tip on it) and it doesn’t work. \n\nIt wasn’t closed all the way (the tip) and won’t close all the way. I’m going to take this pencil into the Apple Store and ask for one that’s actually new or a refund if they give me another busted pencil. \n\nI might as well have bought three bootleg pencils and I’d have saved money and wouldn’t have products that actually work. \n",

    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "I'm a doctor and built a responsive breathing app for anxiety and sleep. It's now App of the Day!! (75% off lifetime to celebrate)",
    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

    "selftext": "I just got an open box iPhone 13 mini (128gb) recently.  It appears to be brand new in box, battery health is 100%, screen and body is mint.  Everything works perfectly about it, except for one problem where it seems to turn off (sometimes) when in my pocket.\n\nI updated the phone to iOS 26 as soon as I got it, so I cannot confirm if this was happening on the older iOS.  I previously updated from a 1st gen SE, which didn't have this problem (in the same pockets.)\n\nBasically, I'll look at my phone, lock it with the side button, put it in my pocket.  Sometimes when I take it out again and try to unlock it, it's off.  I can hold the power button for a second and it will boot up and runs as normal, battery is where it was before.  I checked the logs and there are no \"panics\".  I've tried disabling features like \"tap to wake\", \"raise to wake\", etc. in case it was somehow affecting it, no change.  I also have an official (probably not counterfeit?) leather case, which I've taken off for testing and the problem persists.  I have never had this happen outside of a pocket, even if I try to replicate it (holding it upright, rubbing it against the outside of the pocket.)\n\nThe company I bought it from has offered to exchange the phone already, but I'd rather not go through all the hassle if it's something I can figure out and fix.\n\nI've also searched around on google, and found other people describing the same problem, usually without any follow up or solution, and most replies point to it being a battery problem.  However, if that were the case, why only when in a \"pocket\"?\n\nI've also tried cleaning out the charging port, even though it looked perfectly clean, no change.\n\nAny ideas?",

Many Apple sheep are saying it’s MY fault and just throwing excuses wherever they can to defend their almighty fruit. If my phone literally can’t do the most basic thing it can do without stuttering (scrolling through the Home Screen, control center, etc) is it really MY fault?? For comparison, iOS 18 ran almost FLAWLESSLY for me. It didn’t matter what I was doing or if it was in low power mode or screen recording it was still smooth as butter. Why can’t so many people see how crap this release actually is? Not to mention SO many bugs that haven’t even been fixed since the first developer beta. I can’t even have more than 3 apps open at once before one of them has to reload. Whoever at Apple is allowing these releases needs to be fired because they are doing a terrible job. I honestly hope this post ages poorly and everything is fixed by 26.3 or something because 26.1 RC is an absolute joke. Just give us back iOS 18 in the meantime so I can actually use my phone.",

Back in my Android days, I used to easily move photos from the Camera folder into different folders based on categories (Family, Friends, Official, Trips etc) just simple select and move. Then, whenever my phone was running out of space, I’d simply connect it to my PC via cable and cut andpaste those folders. My phone stayed clean, and everything was neatly sorted on my PC.\n\n\n\nI’ve been trying to find a simple way to do the same with my iPhone but haven’t had any success. I do have iCloud backup, but I also want an **offline backup that’s PROPERLY sorted**.\n\n\n\nIs there any easy way to do this? It would honestly be a life saver.",

Recently, I noticed something strange — when I record a video and switch to the telephoto lens, the live preview looks shaky (like it’s reacting to my hand movements). However, once I check the recorded video, it’s perfectly stable.\n\nIs this normal behavior, or could my OIS be malfunctioning?  \nI also thought it might be related to the recent iOS 26.0.1 update.\n\nHere are two clips for comparison — one showing the live preview and the other the actual recorded video. Also video was recorded at 4k60fps, HDR and scene detection on. \n\nlive preview video:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/L2QS6r6](https://imgur.com/a/L2QS6r6)\n\nactual video:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Mx33kzF](https://imgur.com/a/Mx33kzF)",

    "selftext": "People who have received their iPhones recently (especially **17 Pro Max**), do you notice any green tint issues? Or if you have checked your display serial recently, it would be helpful if you could mention that. Just trying to see if the recently delivered iPhones have the same issues as the initial batch or not, thank you!\n\n\n\n**Backstory:** I got my 17 Pro Max on 28th September, and I noticed immediately that the display looked (for a lack of better word) **shit** compared to my 15 Pro Max that I had at the time. I started searching Reddit forums and saw a ton of green tint issues, especially on iPhone 17 and 17 Pro Max.\n\n\n\nI checked the display serial by following the instructions mentioned on one of those threads; my 15PM had G9N whereas my 17PM had GH3 which further cemented the fact that I wasn't imagining things. Anyway, I did use some workarounds by applying color filters in accessibility settings but still, it didn't sit right with me to spend $1338 (after tax) on a device and get an inferior display, so I returned it.\n\n\n\nI didn't replace it at the time since getting another would still have high chances of it being from the same batch where the demand is high initially, and some might have slipped through the QC (I think). Now, I am planning to get another iPhone 17PM soon since the shipping dates have stabilized now and I see the phone's availability in stores nearby. Hence, the initial question.",

Especially as someone who loves to make photos and videos and creating artworks just for fun, my thoughts are:   \nThe camera of the iPhone Air having only 2x optical zoom and missing wide angel, how would it fit in my daily business?  \nHaving said that I have exported all photos taken with my iPhone 15 Pro Max to run an exiftool statistic and these are the results. In summary, missing 5x zoom not to be a major issue but the wide angel is:  \nMaybe it helps to take a good decision to learn more about the own usage of an iPhone. For instance, before switching to an iPhone 15 Pro Max, I had been missing a 5x zoom and now I see only 3% of my pictures are taken with 5x zoom. \n\n|category|type|FocalLength|**DigitalZoomRatio**|count|share|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Ultrawide**|0.5×|2.2 mm|1.0|325|**17.5 %**|\n|**Standard** |1×|6.8 mm|1.0|1 272|**68.5 %**|\n|**Optical Zoom 2×**|Tele|12.7–13.8 mm|2.0|94|**5.1 %**|\n|**Optical Zoom 3×**|Tele|15.7–16.0 mm|3.0|102|**5.5 %**|\n|**Optical Zoom 5×**|Tele|25.6–26.0 mm|5.0|59|**3.2 %**|\n|**Digital Zoom**|—|8–20 mm (variabel)|1.3–4.7|18|**1.0 %**|\n|**Sum (iPhone 15 Pro Max)**|—|—|—|**1 870**|**100 %**|",

    "selftext": "Here is a list of the advantages by going with either model. Maybe you are looking at either a refurbished 16 Pro or a new 17, maybe this will help.\n\n**16 Pro:**\n\n* 5x Telephoto camera\n* Pro formats such as ProRes, Log, RAW etc... (Very useful if you are deep into editing videos/photos)\n* Main camera has a much larger sensor (better for low light, more dynamic range, shallower depth of field, less noise)\n* LiDAR (useful for AR, 3D stuff, low light photography)\n* USB 3 (Much faster wired data transfers)\n* Titanium frame (Feels more solid, metallic and premium compared to aluminium)\n* Record up to 4k 120 fps (120 fps is useful, because you can slow it down in editing to a lower fps, giving you a really nice slow motion shot)\n* Second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization for video \n* Studio quality microphones\n* Better speakers? (I was unable to confirm this one)\n\n  \n\n\n**Base 17:**\n\n* Ceramic Shield 2 front glass (More durable, significantly more scratch resistant)\n* ≈ 10% faster CPU\n* ≈ 15% faster GPU\n* The new Neural Accelerators are the real deal, dramatic speed improvements when running local AI models, but with only 8gb RAM I'm not sure how useful this will be. \n* 256gb base storage\n* Slightly longer battery life \n* Much improved front facing camera with Center Stage\n* Much higher outdoor screen brightness\n* Lighter (177 grams)\n* Bluetooth 6\n* \\+ 1 year of software support (If Apple keeps up the current trend)\n* Anti-reflective coating (Reduces glare for better outdoor visibility)\n* Faster charging\n\n  \n\n\n**So, which one did i pick for myself?**\n\nI managed to get a deal on a \"refurbished\" 16 Pro 256gb in brand new condition for $100 cheaper than a new 17.\n\nI picked it over the 17 because I'm deep into photography and i wanted the better camera system (17 Pro was out of my budget). But if I wasn't into photography then I would've picked the 17.",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

Any case you get (at least semi-transparent ones) start to come apart at the seems very quickly. After 4 cases this has happened each time, sometimes within a day of use and sometimes after a couple months. Google and you will find it’s a common problem. The plastic bordering the camera that has their own logo on it also cracks very quickly. Ten day return window should have been a red flag to me. If you ask for a warranty replacement they will honor it ONCE but will not warranty that replacement case even if it starts to fall apart 3 days later. If you push back on this they’ll send you another replacement but won’t give you a refund, which doesn’t help since it’s a recurring quality problem. Super disappointed since they have cute designs and they’re expensive af. Better off getting a brand like Speck and putting stickers on it. I’ve had $10 Amazon cases last far, far longer. You also have to EMAIL them in order to leave a review on their website, which explains how they have no 1 star reviews on their site. Very misleading. ",

    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThe thing I hate most about iPhones is how difficult it is to do an offline backup. I’ve been an Android user for many years and switched to iPhone about 5–6 years ago. Back in my Android days, I used to easily move photos from the Camera folder into different folders based on categories (Family, Friends, Official, Trips etc) just simple select and move. Then, whenever my phone was running out of space, I’d simply connect it to my PC via cable and cut andpaste those folders. My phone stayed clean, and everything was neatly sorted on my PC.\n\n\n\nI’ve been trying to find a simple way to do the same with my iPhone but haven’t had any success. I do have iCloud backup, but I also want an **offline backup that’s PROPERLY sorted**.\n\n\n\nIs there any easy way to do this? It would honestly be a life saver.",

Everything works perfectly about it, except for one problem where it seems to turn off (sometimes) when in my pocket.\n\nI updated the phone to iOS 26 as soon as I got it, so I cannot confirm if this was happening on the older iOS.  I previously updated from a 1st gen SE, which didn't have this problem (in the same pockets.)\n\nBasically, I'll look at my phone, lock it with the side button, put it in my pocket.  Sometimes when I take it out again and try to unlock it, it's off.  I can hold the power button for a second and it will boot up and runs as normal, battery is where it was before.  I checked the logs and there are no \"panics\".  I've tried disabling features like \"tap to wake\", \"raise to wake\", etc. in case it was somehow affecting it, no change.  I also have an official (probably not counterfeit?) leather case, which I've taken off for testing and the problem persists.  I have never had this happen outside of a pocket, even if I try to replicate it (holding it upright, rubbing it against the outside of the pocket.)\n\nThe company I bought it from has offered to exchange the phone already, but I'd rather not go through all the hassle if it's something I can figure out and fix.\n\nI've also searched around on google, and found other people describing the same problem, usually without any follow up or solution, and most replies point to it being a battery problem.  However, if that were the case, why only when in a \"pocket\"?\n\nI've also tried cleaning out the charging port, even though it looked perfectly clean, no change.\n\nAny ideas?",

After 4 cases this has happened each time, sometimes within a day of use and sometimes after a couple months. Google and you will find it’s a common problem. The plastic bordering the camera that has their own logo on it also cracks very quickly. Ten day return window should have been a red flag to me. If you ask for a warranty replacement they will honor it ONCE but will not warranty that replacement case even if it starts to fall apart 3 days later. If you push back on this they’ll send you another replacement but won’t give you a refund, which doesn’t help since it’s a recurring quality problem. Super disappointed since they have cute designs and they’re expensive af. Better off getting a brand like Speck and putting stickers on it. I’ve had $10 Amazon cases last far, far longer. You also have to EMAIL them in order to leave a review on their website, which explains how they have no 1 star reviews on their site. Very misleading. ",

    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThe thing I hate most about iPhones is how difficult it is to do an offline backup. I’ve been an Android user for many years and switched to iPhone about 5–6 years ago. Back in my Android days, I used to easily move photos from the Camera folder into different folders based on categories (Family, Friends, Official, Trips etc) just simple select and move. Then, whenever my phone was running out of space, I’d simply connect it to my PC via cable and cut andpaste those folders. My phone stayed clean, and everything was neatly sorted on my PC.\n\n\n\nI’ve been trying to find a simple way to do the same with my iPhone but haven’t had any success. I do have iCloud backup, but I also want an **offline backup that’s PROPERLY sorted**.\n\n\n\nIs there any easy way to do this? It would honestly be a life saver.",

    "selftext": "I just got an open box iPhone 13 mini (128gb) recently.  It appears to be brand new in box, battery health is 100%, screen and body is mint.  Everything works perfectly about it, except for one problem where it seems to turn off (sometimes) when in my pocket.\n\nI updated the phone to iOS 26 as soon as I got it, so I cannot confirm if this was happening on the older iOS.  I previously updated from a 1st gen SE, which didn't have this problem (in the same pockets.)\n\nBasically, I'll look at my phone, lock it with the side button, put it in my pocket.  Sometimes when I take it out again and try to unlock it, it's off.  I can hold the power button for a second and it will boot up and runs as normal, battery is where it was before.  I checked the logs and there are no \"panics\".  I've tried disabling features like \"tap to wake\", \"raise to wake\", etc. in case it was somehow affecting it, no change.  I also have an official (probably not counterfeit?) leather case, which I've taken off for testing and the problem persists.  I have never had this happen outside of a pocket, even if I try to replicate it (holding it upright, rubbing it against the outside of the pocket.)\n\nThe company I bought it from has offered to exchange the phone already, but I'd rather not go through all the hassle if it's something I can figure out and fix.\n\nI've also searched around on google, and found other people describing the same problem, usually without any follow up or solution, and most replies point to it being a battery problem.  However, if that were the case, why only when in a \"pocket\"?\n\nI've also tried cleaning out the charging port, even though it looked perfectly clean, no change.\n\nAny ideas?",

I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

    "title": "Android Verified Boot and the Bootloader Unlock Security Theater",
    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

    "selftext": "Hola amigos y usuarios de Pixel. Hace cuestión de 1 semana más o menos actualicé mi Pixel 8 Pro de Android 15 a Android 16. La cuestión es que, en Android 15 me funcionaba perfectamente las redes móviles. No tenía problemas de nada. Luego de actualizar a Android 16 es donde empiezan los problemas. El icono de señal automáticamente aparece con un \"!\" y sin ningún rastro de señal. Se soluciona UNICAMENTE con un reinicio, pero funciona por 3 - 5 minutos hasta que vuelve en lo mismo. Sin señal, sin datos, NADA. Que hiciste con el módem en Android 16, Google? Acaso es una estrategia para que me cambié a un nuevo Pixel y luego hagas lo mismo? Ya probé de todo, restablecer de fabrica, cambiar de SIM, reinstalar software, y nada lo soluciona. Ya vi en diferentes foros y realmente es un problema real que afecta a 4/10 usuarios de Pixel 8 Pro. Realmente es muy indignante que Google no de una resolución real del tema, sabiendo bien que hay miles de usuarios con Pixel 8 Pro con el MISMO problema luego de la actualización. Lo realmente malo es que mi garantía ya acabo hace cuestión de 6 meses por lo que el que pierde soy yo. Estoy seguro de que si Google no lanza una actualización que solucione el problema del módem, no volveré a comprar otro teléfono Pixel en mi vida, y empezaré a juntar firmas para una demanda colectiva con personas que tengan el mismo modelo y problema.

Solution: call your city's NON emergency 911 number. The person then routed me to a dispatcher. I asked if there was a way for me to test if my phone would dial 911 properly. She told me just to hang up and call 911 right now. I did that, the same dispatcher picked up. I told her it's me again, thanks for letting me test it. She said, no problem and hung up. \n\nI think if you're very concerned about this potential issue, just call the non emergency number for your city and explain it to them. The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes. You can select the notification and dismiss this. ",

    "selftext": "I wanted to make this because so many people complain on this subreddit about the phone not being fast enough, or having the best specs, etc, etc and wanted to give my perspective as a lifelong Android user since I got my first Smartphone, which was an HTC myTouch in 2010.\n\nThe reality is, Google has moved past a specs race and enthusiast market with this phone and the past recent pixel phones, and it's evident not only in their marketing for it and how they want you to use their phone with Gemini, but also who they're targeting in general.\n\nIn the past, the phone was aimed at enthusiast and it flopped. I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

    "selftext": "Hi! I’m having an issue with my Pixel 8 Plus. For the last couple of weeks, whenever I record videos on apps like Snapchat or WhatsApp, there’s no sound at all. But the mic works totally fine in the regular Camera app and for voice notes.\n\nI’ve already tried a bunch of things:\n• Checked microphone permissions\n• Updated the apps and system software\n• Cleared cache/reinstalled the apps\n• Restarted the phone\n\nNothing has fixed it. The phone was working fine for over a year before this, so I’m guessing it might be a software issue affecting third-party apps.\n\nCould anyone help me figure out what’s going on or what to do next? It seems impossible to contact google 😅\n\nThanks so much!",

System settings said that it was around 40°C, which is right at the threshold of it being slightly overheating. I was in 5g, it wasn't charging, the screen wasn turned off for hours although I do have always on display activated and I wasn't in sleep modee, I have adaptive battery on and only have allowed unlimited background activity to a couple apps like Instagram or Discord in order to get their notifications as soon as they arrive. \n\nThe only thing I can think of was that it was underneath my pillow while I was sleeping, but it shouldn't have generated that amount of heat if it wasn't doing something. That and the always on display being on that night. 10% of battery disappeared between when I stopped charging and when I noticed the heat, Instagram was the app that used the most battery during this time. I only ever had 3 or 4 percent disappearing during an entire night, so 10% in 3-4 hours seems like a lot.\n\nThe phone doesn't even heat that much when using it intensively or when charging. The heat wasn't located in a single spot, it was all over the screen at the same level. I had to turn it off in order for it to go back to normal, and since then, nothing.\n\nHas anyone ever encountered a problem like this ? I've seen reports of heating issues with these phones on Reddit but nothing that matches my experience.",

    "selftext": "I just bought a Pixel 8a advertised as new but I suspect its a refurb - reasons why TLDR:\n\n* It didn't have a QR code\n* Battery capacity is about 4200mah instead of 4492\n   * When first turning on the phone it was at 100% charge\n* The [device authenticity checker](https://store.google.com/us/device-authenticity?id=123&hl=en-US) shows production in 2024 but the phone self reports as 2023\n* When setting up the phone it had region set to China, with warranty info for US (but I'm in the EU)\n\nAre these solid reasons to think something is not right?\n\nSome additional thoughts:\n\n**Battery**\n\nI read there is a variance in the battery capacity but none mentioned lower than 4300 mAh, so I feel 4200 is low. Also - I don't think that normal for a new phone to be at 100% battery? Unless something changed wiith tech I think its quite unusual.\n\nI know battery apps are not usually perfect but I get the same amount of 4200 reported from one that measures via charging cycles, and one that reads the hardware info directly from the device.\n\n**Authenticity checker / QR Code**\n\nI've read on the device authenticity checker that genuine products should come with a holographic QR code but I don't recall seeing one on my last Pixel, so I could be wrong?\n\nAlso the manufacturing year mismatch via the authenticity checker seems off to me but no idea if there could be a genuine discrepancy? My other pixels self reported dates matched the ones on this site.\n\nIts a shame that we can no longer see the \"first activated\" date.\n\n**Phone Region**\n\nI'm guessing if the phone was manufactured in China, that's why it might prompt me to set the region as China when first loading? Again I have bought pixels before and never seen this, but I think I did see somthing similer with my oneplus.\n\nAnyway, I'd be grateful for anyone more knowledgable to chime in and let me know if my suspicions are correct - I don't mind having a refurb, but I could have paid less by *intentionally* buying one.",

I looked at the product photos and it doesn't appear to have the thumbprint hole, but I've still been burned in the past by incorrect product photos when I tried to buy a replacement screen protector for my 6 Pro) \\*unfortunately the cheaper screen protector provided by Case-Mate is currently out of stock and I have no idea when or if it'll come back\n\n\\-Pixelsnap Charger with Stand (this is the big one; my main issue is that my previous Pixel Stand Charger that I used with the 6 Pro is very slow to charge my new 10 Pro XL because I guess they changed how the charging works)\n\n\\-finally, what Pixelsnap compatible case are you using? There's quite a few options and it's kind of overwhelming because there doesn't seem to be any reviews displayed for any of these accessories. Ideally I'd like one that protrudes out enough to protect the cameras on the back of the phone so I can maybe skip on buying a glass screen protector for the cameras, but it's difficult for me to tell if any of the cases are like that.\n\nIt's fine if you don't have the XL specifically, but have the regular 10 or the 10 Pro.

Straight forward, opens and saves fast.\n\nBut, it's not great. For example. I want to block someone out of the photo (College Lecturer, infront, in the middle of the digital whiteboard), the only way to do that is use the markup pen, with the width of a human hair, to scribble that person out! Which takes forEVER!\n\nWouldn't it be easier if 1) We could change the thickness of the pen. Or 2) Just add a few black boxes over said person. Even a 'Blur' brush, so we could blur that person out.\n\nI'm fully aware of Photoshop Express, Lightroom, Photoshop online (Adobe full package user) etc. But they take time to load up + load / import the image > edit it > save / export it > find which ever folder it's in > Move the image to the DCIM / Camera folder then it's date is different to the rest, so it's not in order... Yea, it's a faff.\n\nSo, @Google (do they even read this forum?), please, could you just add some more basic features to the default Google photo editing app?\n\n* Edit the pen thickness.\n* Add coloured shapes.\n* A blur tool to blur specific parts of an image.\n* Maybe an 'add other image, to the edit' option. Etc\n\nI'm sure Google has a mountain of people it can call upon to do this? Idk. Just a suggestion.\n\nKind regards, Dragonfyr",

I thought that was odd, but now I know they use it as an excuse to not honor the warranty. \n\nSo I contacted Google and they said they could only honor the warranty if I get the scratches fixed first - scratches on the screen that is being replaced.

    "selftext": "I've been with Pixel quite a while now as I am not a Apple fan and like the camera performance, plus many updates compared to Samsung that basically seemed to want you to buy a new phone regularly so they didn't' update. \n\nCurrently 8 Pro. I'm not a phone expert so help please. \n\nKeyboard - there's a big white space at the bottom unused, but having large hands I'm always hitting a letter instead of space bar which is frustrating as there's free space there. Also, Apple for years has used a sort of zoom feature where the buttons get bigger as you approach them. Is there a solution or preferred keyboard? \n\nFiles - As a political warrior I use Threads / FB / Bluesky, however I'd like to manage my meme files better. Right now these apps default to their own folders. I'd like to be able to reorganize them all into topical folders so I can save time accessing them. Frequently I recall the file meme, but not where it is and have to search multiple locations. I realize much of this is likely app driven, but still would like to be more in control of these files! Suggestions? It would be preferred to have a \"Meme directory\". I have experience with MSDos and windows for years, but Android apps seems locked down and kind of stuck with awkwardness of these defaults. \n\nBluetooth - 1. with so many bluetooth devices nowadays, why the heck does Pixel only show about 3 of the saved ones, requiring another tap to \"see all\" when if they were all listed in the first place I could be there already?  2. I'd LOVE the ability to CONTROL BTooth connections FFS. My backyard has stereo speakers wired to a receiver with a BT add-on, and I ignorantly bought a second one same type for the main sound system. Unless I unplug the unwanted one, my phone will switch between them almost randomly w/o asking. My car uses a BT adapter plugged in and has its own BT circuit. To get the adapter to connect, I seem to have to \"forget\" the car BT and connect to the adapter, but it doesn't do this reliably. I have to keep trying over and over, for some reason it eventually works. The car BT \"asks\" to connect during this time seeming to interfere with my desired connection in the process. Maybe I'm a boomer but BT seems to be designed by sadists as its such a PITA. My phone also is reluctant to BT to my Win11 laptop for some reason as well, but supposed to be easy.  sigh.\n\nUpcoming alarm dismiss - this used to show up on my notification list, after a recent update it doesn't. I've gone through menus looking for a way to go back to having it listed, but to no avail. I take a morning med that has to be 1 hour before eating, and frequently my body wakes up before the alarm, so this is something that I deal with daily. Not huge but a step backwards.  ",

We’ve reset the password, logged in successfully on other devices, even removed the Pixel from “Your Devices” in her Google Account. Still, the phone refuses to accept it and keeps showing that FRP message.\n\nHere’s what we’ve already tried:\n\n* Waited over **three days** after resetting the password (to bypass the 72-hour FRP delay).\n* Removed the device from her Google account and waited again.\n* Double-checked that the email and password are correct (copy/paste).\n* Attempted account recovery just to verify ownership.\n\nWhen trying to recover the account via phone number, the recovery screen even shows a **completely different email** as being linked — which makes zero sense because this number was only added recently and has *never* been tied to another Google account.\n\nSo right now we have a phone that’s totally unusable even though we can log into the correct Google account everywhere else. It feels like the FRP system has just bugged out and won’t recognize the legit owner anymore.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Has anyone else seen FRP get stuck like this after a password reset?\n2. Is there *any* legit way to make Google refresh or re-sync ownership on their side?\n3. Would contacting Google Support with proof of purchase and IMEI actually help?\n4. Any other ideas before this thing becomes an expensive paperweight?\n\nWe don’t want to mess with shady bypass tools — just looking for a proper fix. Any help or firsthand experiences appreciated!",

They are more annoying than deal breakers so as of now I think I would still stick with the pixel 10 pro because of the benefits it has. It would be nice to resolve some of these though.\n\nIssues\n- YouTube sometimes slow . Shorts don't load . This is rare. \n- on screen buttons not registering my touch sometimes. Not sure if it is more sensitive to placement than my prior phone but I have noticed a handful of times in multiple apps that this is the case. YouTube, obsidian , chrome\n- content and sometimes buttons are only partly on the screen in some apps. Maybe this is typical on the smaller devices. The pixel 10 corners also seem more rounded than my s24+\n- obsidian note taking app closes despite me trying every optimization I can find to keep it open. \n- obsidian links do not render as links sometimes in edit mode. They do render if I turn to view mode. Just checked and obsidian on the s24+ doesn't have this issue. \n- swiping doesn't work as consistently. Reddit app, my open app drawer, ect. I have to swipe further across for it to fully switch to the next thing. Just tried on the s24+ end it doesn't have this issue despite being a bigger screen. ",

    "selftext": "I wanted to make this because so many people complain on this subreddit about the phone not being fast enough, or having the best specs, etc, etc and wanted to give my perspective as a lifelong Android user since I got my first Smartphone, which was an HTC myTouch in 2010.\n\nThe reality is, Google has moved past a specs race and enthusiast market with this phone and the past recent pixel phones, and it's evident not only in their marketing for it and how they want you to use their phone with Gemini, but also who they're targeting in general.\n\nIn the past, the phone was aimed at enthusiast and it flopped. I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

Solution: call your city's NON emergency 911 number. The person then routed me to a dispatcher. I asked if there was a way for me to test if my phone would dial 911 properly. She told me just to hang up and call 911 right now. I did that, the same dispatcher picked up. I told her it's me again, thanks for letting me test it. She said, no problem and hung up. \n\nI think if you're very concerned about this potential issue, just call the non emergency number for your city and explain it to them. The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes. You can select the notification and dismiss this. ",

Google tells me there's nothing they can do beyond this and tell me they're going to replace the phone to solve this issue. Great!  Then I mention there's cosmetic damage on the screen. Nope!!! \"Since the device has some physical damages, this will void the warranty\"\n\nThe cosmetic damage on the screen has nothing to do with my issue, completely unrelated.

La cuestión es que, en Android 15 me funcionaba perfectamente las redes móviles. No tenía problemas de nada. Luego de actualizar a Android 16 es donde empiezan los problemas. El icono de señal automáticamente aparece con un \"!\" y sin ningún rastro de señal. Se soluciona UNICAMENTE con un reinicio, pero funciona por 3 - 5 minutos hasta que vuelve en lo mismo. Sin señal, sin datos, NADA. Que hiciste con el módem en Android 16, Google? Acaso es una estrategia para que me cambié a un nuevo Pixel y luego hagas lo mismo? Ya probé de todo, restablecer de fabrica, cambiar de SIM, reinstalar software, y nada lo soluciona. Ya vi en diferentes foros y realmente es un problema real que afecta a 4/10 usuarios de Pixel 8 Pro. Realmente es muy indignante que Google no de una resolución real del tema, sabiendo bien que hay miles de usuarios con Pixel 8 Pro con el MISMO problema luego de la actualización. Lo realmente malo es que mi garantía ya acabo hace cuestión de 6 meses por lo que el que pierde soy yo. Estoy seguro de que si Google no lanza una actualización que solucione el problema del módem, no volveré a comprar otro teléfono Pixel en mi vida, y empezaré a juntar firmas para una demanda colectiva con personas que tengan el mismo modelo y problema.

Also - I don't think that normal for a new phone to be at 100% battery? Unless something changed wiith tech I think its quite unusual.\n\nI know battery apps are not usually perfect but I get the same amount of 4200 reported from one that measures via charging cycles, and one that reads the hardware info directly from the device.\n\n**Authenticity checker / QR Code**\n\nI've read on the device authenticity checker that genuine products should come with a holographic QR code but I don't recall seeing one on my last Pixel, so I could be wrong?\n\nAlso the manufacturing year mismatch via the authenticity checker seems off to me but no idea if there could be a genuine discrepancy? My other pixels self reported dates matched the ones on this site.\n\nIts a shame that we can no longer see the \"first activated\" date.\n\n**Phone Region**\n\nI'm guessing if the phone was manufactured in China, that's why it might prompt me to set the region as China when first loading? Again I have bought pixels before and never seen this, but I think I did see somthing similer with my oneplus.\n\nAnyway, I'd be grateful for anyone more knowledgable to chime in and let me know if my suspicions are correct - I don't mind having a refurb, but I could have paid less by *intentionally* buying one.",

System settings said that it was around 40°C, which is right at the threshold of it being slightly overheating. I was in 5g, it wasn't charging, the screen wasn turned off for hours although I do have always on display activated and I wasn't in sleep modee, I have adaptive battery on and only have allowed unlimited background activity to a couple apps like Instagram or Discord in order to get their notifications as soon as they arrive. \n\nThe only thing I can think of was that it was underneath my pillow while I was sleeping, but it shouldn't have generated that amount of heat if it wasn't doing something. That and the always on display being on that night. 10% of battery disappeared between when I stopped charging and when I noticed the heat, Instagram was the app that used the most battery during this time. I only ever had 3 or 4 percent disappearing during an entire night, so 10% in 3-4 hours seems like a lot.\n\nThe phone doesn't even heat that much when using it intensively or when charging. The heat wasn't located in a single spot, it was all over the screen at the same level. I had to turn it off in order for it to go back to normal, and since then, nothing.\n\nHas anyone ever encountered a problem like this ? I've seen reports of heating issues with these phones on Reddit but nothing that matches my experience.",

    "selftext": "I wanted to make this because so many people complain on this subreddit about the phone not being fast enough, or having the best specs, etc, etc and wanted to give my perspective as a lifelong Android user since I got my first Smartphone, which was an HTC myTouch in 2010.\n\nThe reality is, Google has moved past a specs race and enthusiast market with this phone and the past recent pixel phones, and it's evident not only in their marketing for it and how they want you to use their phone with Gemini, but also who they're targeting in general.\n\nIn the past, the phone was aimed at enthusiast and it flopped. I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes.

La cuestión es que, en Android 15 me funcionaba perfectamente las redes móviles. No tenía problemas de nada. Luego de actualizar a Android 16 es donde empiezan los problemas. El icono de señal automáticamente aparece con un \"!\" y sin ningún rastro de señal. Se soluciona UNICAMENTE con un reinicio, pero funciona por 3 - 5 minutos hasta que vuelve en lo mismo. Sin señal, sin datos, NADA. Que hiciste con el módem en Android 16, Google? Acaso es una estrategia para que me cambié a un nuevo Pixel y luego hagas lo mismo? Ya probé de todo, restablecer de fabrica, cambiar de SIM, reinstalar software, y nada lo soluciona. Ya vi en diferentes foros y realmente es un problema real que afecta a 4/10 usuarios de Pixel 8 Pro. Realmente es muy indignante que Google no de una resolución real del tema, sabiendo bien que hay miles de usuarios con Pixel 8 Pro con el MISMO problema luego de la actualización. Lo realmente malo es que mi garantía ya acabo hace cuestión de 6 meses por lo que el que pierde soy yo. Estoy seguro de que si Google no lanza una actualización que solucione el problema del módem, no volveré a comprar otro teléfono Pixel en mi vida, y empezaré a juntar firmas para una demanda colectiva con personas que tengan el mismo modelo y problema.

I saw that Pixel has something similar called Private Space but when I try set it up, it asks for Google Log In (other than the current Pixel logged in Google Account). I can't just simply move apps to hide. And it shows only Google Apps which are awaiting new Google Log Ins.\n\n2. Google Photos App is too unnecessary bloated. I wanted a simple galley app. I also don't want Photos back up. Are there safe and secure options ?",

My question is: once it’s repaired, is the issue likely to come back again, or did they fix the issue pernemantly?\n\nIf it’s a long-term solution, I keep it .

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

Now I’m looking at the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra and wanted to hear from people who’ve spent time with them.\n\nOn paper they seem very close, but I’m curious about how they actually feel day to day. How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

But that was my fault to not have backup.\n\n\n\nAnyway, i gotten a cheap Xiaomi phone to use until i was back to my country since i acquired Samsung care+.\n\nOnce returned and submitted it to the Samsung costumer center they mentioned few times, it will be a free repair unless water damage is detected.\n\nOf course, i kept the phone relatively well, but it received its shares of water splashes, and knowing very well what waterproof mean in the phone world i was ready to pay the 93\\~USD of screen change out of warranty. (The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra? I guess i use it as a Dex PC. ",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I’ve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

But now that I'm four weeks out I'm seeing further improvement.\n\nInitially after 24 hours my charge would drop to under 20% (starting at 90%).  At a week it would be between 30 and 40%.  Now four weeks out I'm above 50%.  Charging times have been correspondingly reduced.  The only change I can think of is being totally dissatisfied with Samsung Health exporting data I've limited what it exports, but it's still exporting heart rate 24/7, and I think that gets sent to the phone even without using Samsung Health at all.\n\nHave others notice similar significant changes in battery drain?\n\nEdit:  I should have knocked wood after posting. Today it was down to 18% which hasn't happened since the first week.  No unusual uses yesterday.",

I am now charging it daily, but I might have to bump that to twice a day.\n\nToday, I charged my watch to 100%, put it on, unlocked it and then went about my day, I dont use my watch that often so imagine my surprise when I get in bed, 8 hours later, after having power saver on all day, that my watch is at 1%, and that only 0.5% of the battery was used by OneUI home, the rest just disappeared.\n\nAny ideas, other than pure watch age, that this might be happening? Its really rather frustrating.",

Is the 40mm capable of that or do I need to lower my expectations?",

When I try to add the device in the Galaxy Wearable app, it’s successfully detected and added, but the connection process takes an indefinitely long time, and eventually, the message “Couldn’t connect to your watch” appears.

But if it's damn near microscopic I cannot and it's really annoying on stage. Last time I had to pretend I was checking my steps in order to see what time I'm at. Does anybody know how I can set it to the old way where it takes up the whole screen? It also does this for the timer, which is also annoying when I'm at the gym and it minimizes it when I'm doing 1 minute reps. But that's not as essential. I have googled other reddit posts but they're all old/out dated/have instructions to options that no longer exist. I'd really appreciate some help. Thank you! ",

After an initial prompt/click, the screen displays a constant loading icon (rotating dots on top of green button), and the record never appears (see screenshot).\n​I have confirmed all permissions are granted and have already tried: reinstallation of Samsung Health, clearing cache/memory, and restarting both devices.\n​Has anyone found a solution to this 'Show on phone' sync failure",

    "selftext": "So...... my phone (S21 Ultra) took a dive in a swimming pool.   I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

However, when using Gemini, it simply gives an \"UNKNOWN ERROR\" message, even though it behaves as if the alarm was set.

My current watch is a simple FitBit Versa 3 (so any Galaxy watch will be an upgrade lol).\n\n- I mainly wish to use the watch as an extension of my phone (texting, calling, music control, etc) with my phone nearby, so the LTE function won't be a necessity.\n\n- The main secondary purpose I need my watch for is fitness tracking: Tracking heart rate, steps, calories, distance, etc.\n\nI am on the fence right now. I have found a 47mm Galaxy 6 Classic for quite a good deal ($109 for the bluetooth OR LTE model), and that is the model I'm leaning towards. But before I buy, I want to know if paying an extra $100-$150 for the Galaxy 7 would be worth it for any newer specs or features that it has. \n\nI won't be using my watch as much for temperature tracking and GPS purposes (beyond tracking running/biking distance which I can also have my phone on me for). \n\nI also dont plan to download a ton of apps (mainly the defaults, a few interchangable watch faces, timer, calorie tracking, metronome, Spotify control, and possibly 1 or 2 games) so I'm unsure of how much of an impact the 16GB to 32GB difference would make on my satisfaction with either one. \n\nPlease, any insight, advice, and experience would be greatly appreciated!

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

The only change I can think of is being totally dissatisfied with Samsung Health exporting data I've limited what it exports, but it's still exporting heart rate 24/7, and I think that gets sent to the phone even without using Samsung Health at all.\n\nHave others notice similar significant changes in battery drain?\n\nEdit:  I should have knocked wood after posting. Today it was down to 18% which hasn't happened since the first week.  No unusual uses yesterday.",

I have tried everything I have found during my searches to try; wearing it further up the wrist, tighter, factory resetting the watch, clearing cache and data, enabling the snore detection and other options and it still does not come close to accurate. I do manually put my phone/watch into Sleep mode every night and manually turn off every morning. I have even shaved my wrist under the watch because I am quite hairy.\n\nUsually, it tells me I fell asleep 3 hours after I actually fell asleep and wake up time has been somewhat accurate. Last night.....it told me I did not sleep at all and after I woke up and sat on the couch for an hour it told me I had just finished a nap. Huh?!?!??!\n\nIt seems like others have reported issues with sleep but one of the \"fixes\" seems to work for them. Is this just a defective watch or a defective body?",

    "selftext": "Hello, ever since the last Galaxy Watch update my stopwatch setting has been minimizing to the very bottom of my watch. I am a public speaker and use the timer to stick to my time and I have perfected deceptively peaking at my watch without the audience seeing. But if it's damn near microscopic I cannot and it's really annoying on stage. Last time I had to pretend I was checking my steps in order to see what time I'm at. Does anybody know how I can set it to the old way where it takes up the whole screen? It also does this for the timer, which is also annoying when I'm at the gym and it minimizes it when I'm doing 1 minute reps. But that's not as essential. I have googled other reddit posts but they're all old/out dated/have instructions to options that no longer exist. I'd really appreciate some help. Thank you! ",

It felt like the watch was paired with my phone, but not actually connected. After I reset the watch, I successfully paired it with my phone again, but the message “Check your phone to complete setup” keeps lingering. When I try to add the device in the Galaxy Wearable app, it’s successfully detected and added, but the connection process takes an indefinitely long time, and eventually, the message “Couldn’t connect to your watch” appears. Interestingly, the Bluetooth connection between the phone and the watch gets disconnected automatically afterwards. I have no idea what to do next.   \n  \nHas anyone encountered something similar?

I have even shaved my wrist under the watch because I am quite hairy.\n\nUsually, it tells me I fell asleep 3 hours after I actually fell asleep and wake up time has been somewhat accurate. Last night.....it told me I did not sleep at all and after I woke up and sat on the couch for an hour it told me I had just finished a nap. Huh?!?!??!\n\nIt seems like others have reported issues with sleep but one of the \"fixes\" seems to work for them. Is this just a defective watch or a defective body?",

    "selftext": "So I currently have a Lenovo Yoga 7i pretty the much the same specs as the 9i I would just appreciate the OLED screen and 2-in-1 capabilities. My plan was to originally return the 7i and pay the extra $100 for the OLED screen, and 2 in 1 capabilities. But when looking again, I found this HP for even cheaper with seemingly better specs. The 2tb SSD seems pretty sweet plus a slightly more powerful processor. What I'm worried about tho is I hear a lot of talk of HP's software and battery life as well as the build quality not being as good as the Lenovo's, so im wondering how true this is, and if it would be worth it to get the HP for the cheaper price, the Ultra 9, and the extra tb of storage. If it matters im currently in high and planning to use the laptop for an IT degree throughout college. Idk if this is correct or not but I think the HP's have more upgradeability as well?

Some totes finally have laptop sleeves, but the *functionality* is still missing  the straps dig into your shoulders, and carrying it all day feels like lifting weights. Why are women’s bags designed only for aesthetics or “flex” and not actual *comfort* or *usage*?\n\nAnd affordable options are even worse. I can’t spend ₹10K on a bag. \n\nIf you’ve felt the same pain, please share in comments — it’ll honestly make me feel better knowing I’m not the only one dealing with this",

    "selftext": "For the context I'm currently a Computer Science student, I have been using macbook (m1, 8/256) for uni for 3 years at this point. I have a PC at home running windows and an ubuntu server that I can ssh into and code on there instead of on my macbook. This macbook has fanstatic battery life, basically it can sustain for multiple days because I only use it for Uni and not at home\n\nHowever lately I have been running into multiple obstacles where I need to use enterprise program (power designer, powerBI, or some processes that just run out of the box on windows but require additional application on mac like android transfer). So currently I'm looking for an alternative for this macbook. Also yes I know I can setup moonlight to my home pc and probably use my ubuntu server to wake up the pc but it's not a reliable thing to do especially when it involves work, also parallel is too expensive and VM is just too slow since it's a base model\n\nThe only requirement would be great battery life and running windows with 16gb or more RAM (preferably x86 since I heard that many programs doesn't support arm processor). I don't really care about the screen so it dont need to be OLED or something like that but if they do have them It's a plus. Budget is 1K Euro, could be new or second hand\n\nAppreciate any recommendation!",

I was told we will ship it to you and you’ll get it Tuesday, so yesterday. Laptop didn’t come so we called the 800 number and were told to go to the store because this was a instore walk out order. We went and fast forward an hour later the manager explained what happened.  The manager explained that the employee didn’t put the order in or whatever, ok fine. He mentioned a different one maybe an open box item. He told him the same employee told me on Sunday that it wouldn’t have a warranty of open box. He said that was incorrect. Since I needed a laptop then he found one in store that was open box and we had to pay 160 more. Wasnt happy to pay more but thats ok. The manager was super nice during the entire process. \n\nWhen I got the new laptop home and powered it on………IT still BELONGED to someone else and wasn't wiped. \n\nI sent the lady a message on FB so she can contact the store. Her personal information was given to someone else. I personally would wipe it myself before returning it.  \n\nHow can I wipe this laptop myself, when I am trying traditional ways and keeps saying there is an error. \n\n ",

I’m looking for advice on which laptop to pick.\nI’ll mostly use it for everyday stuff — Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Zoom, web browsing, watching movies/TV shows — and occasionally for The Sims 4 (maybe Sims 2 or 3) with a bunch of expansions, mods, and custom content (around 15 GB total, with about 80% being CC).\n\nI don’t really play other PC games — I have a PS5 for that — so this laptop doesn’t need to be a full-on gaming machine.\nI just want something future-proof that’ll last me several years, and I’ll probably use it around 10 hours per week.\nOf course, I want good value for the price too.\n\nHere are the options I’m considering (all prices in PLN):\n\n⸻\n\n💻 Lenovo IdeaPad Slim — 4100 zł\n\t•\tCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS (8C/16T, up to 5.1 GHz)\n\t•\tGPU: Radeon 780M (integrated)\n\t•\tRAM: 24 GB DDR5 (dual channel, maxed out)\n\t•\tSSD: 1 TB PCIe 4.0\n\t•\tDisplay: 16”, 1920×1200, IPS, matte, 60 Hz, 300 nits\n\t•\tBattery: 50 Wh, up to 14h, USB-C charging\n\t•\tWeight: 1.81 kg\n\t•\tBuild: Aluminum, MIL-STD-810H\n✅ Great processor, solid build, but basic display (only 45% NTSC)\n\n⸻\n\n💻 ASUS Vivobook — 5200 zł\n\t•\tCPU: AMD Ryzen AI 7 350\n\t•\tGPU: Radeon 860M (integrated)\n\t•\tRAM: 24 GB LPDDR5X (soldered)\n\t•\tSSD: 1 TB\n\t•\tDisplay: 16”, OLED, 2880×1800, 120 Hz, 400 nits, 100% DCI-P3\n\t•\tBattery: 75 Wh\n\t•\tWeight: 1.5 kg\n✅ Gorgeous OLED screen, great battery, lightweight\n❌ RAM not upgradeable, a bit pricey\n\n⸻\n\n💻 ASUS TUF — 4350 zł\n\t•\tCPU: Ryzen 5 7535HS (6C/12T)\n\t•\tGPU: RTX 4050 (6 GB, 140W TGP)\n\t•\tRAM: 32 GB DDR5\n\t•\tSSD: 1 TB\n\t•\tDisplay: 16”, 144 Hz, 300 nits\n\t•\tWeight: 2.2 kg\n✅ Great performance for the price, powerful GPU\n❌ Heavier, shorter battery life\n\n⸻\n\n💻 HP Victus (Intel) — 4550 zł\n\t•\tCPU: Intel Core 5 210H (8C/12T)\n\t•\tGPU: RTX 5050 (8 GB GDDR7)\n\t•\tRAM: 32 GB DDR5\n\t•\tSSD: 1 TB\n\t•\tDisplay: 15.6”, 1080p, 144 Hz, 300 nits\n✅ Strong performance, future-proof GPU\n❌ A bit bulky and heavy (2.29 kg)\n\n⸻\n\n💻 HP Victus (Ryzen) — 3850 zł\n\t•\tCPU: Ryzen 7 7445HS (6C/12T)\n\t•\tGPU: RTX 4050 (6 GB)\n\t•\tRAM: 32 GB DDR5\n\t•\tSSD: 1 TB\n✅ Great specs for the price, solid GPU\n❌ Slightly older CPU\n\n⸻\n\n💻 ASUS V16 — 4600 zł\n\t•\tCPU: Intel Core 5 210H\n\t•\tGPU: RTX 5050 (8 GB GDDR7)\n\t•\tRAM: 32 GB DDR5\n\t•\tSSD: 1 TB\n✅ Powerful, modern GPU, solid display (16”, 144 Hz)\n❌ 1.95 kg, battery not the biggest\n\n⸻\n\n💻 Dell Inspiron — 3850 zł\n\t•\tCPU: Ryzen 7 8840U\n\t•\tGPU: Radeon Graphics (integrated)\n\t•\tRAM: 32 GB DDR5\n\t•\tSSD: 1 TB\n✅ Lightweight (2.1 kg), decent CPU, aluminum lid\n❌ Weak integrated GPU, basic display (250 nits)\n\n⸻\n\nSo… which one do you think is the best choice for my use case?\nIs it worth paying more for the ASUS Vivobook with the OLED screen, or should I go for one of the gaming models with a dedicated GPU (like HP Victus or ASUS TUF), even if I’ll mostly just use it for everyday stuff and Sims?\n\nAny thoughts or personal experiences would be super appreciated 🙏\n",

I've tried quite a few and sent them all back due to the displays lookong all grainy and also too much fan noise. \n\nRight now I just got a hp omnibook X flip 14 and it's nice , it has 2.8k oled display 120hz which is what I want and the Intel 256v processor which is apparently good on battery life. \n\nThe only thing is it's just too big ! I need a 13 inch but there is literally nothing on the market . I cannot find any 13 inch 2 in 1 that has 2.8k oled 120hz and good battery life . \n\nThere are some that are a few years old like the spectre x360 13.5 but it's so overpriced for a laptop that is not even new . \n\nThere are a few detachable ones but I want a clamshell type. \n\nDoes anyone know of anything ? \n\nThanks ",

The original screen actually isn't all too bad (for my standards at least) with a 1200×800 resolution and *okay* viewing angles and colors.\n\nI left it torn apart for a year, though I finally got around to upgrading it and cleaning it thoroughly. The cleaning proces was absolutely disgusting, with gunk in every single crevice.\n\nThe new specs include an Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 (64 bit), 2 GB of DDR2, the same horrible GMA 950, and a Teamgroup CX2 256 GB SATA SSD. It feels great with a fresh install of Vista Ultimate 64 bit and Aero enabled, though web browsing is an absolute pain. I tried to opt with Linux first, but I couldn't use GNOME (my favorite DE) without it being so slow, so I ended up using Vista instead.\n\nSome remarks:\n\n-This feels great to type on when I'm in class with an outlet right beside me. The battery only lasts a maximum of 1 hour, so I have to charge basically all of the time.\n-I use Google Classroom and Google Docs often, and this laptop can handle those things fine. However, literally anything more than Reddit and 5 tabs will slow everything down to an unusable mess.\n-I will test Photoshop CS2 when I find a proper copy of it, since it meets the system requirements.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post here. I'm a college student and I was searching for something where I could write notes (I still and can't leave behind writing in my notebook) and read. Everyone else en my class has an iPad and I don't like them (OS and price mainly), I think the 2 in 1 laptops are the best options. Since they have a keyboard and I type a lot and they are foldable and can read comfortably using the touchscreen.\n\nSadly the price is a really important factor deciding in what to buy. Right now I'm between a refurbished Dell Latitude 5420 or 7420 on Amazon, or a HP Envy x360 I saw on Marketplace (although those are a bit more expensive).\n\nNow my questions would be the following:\n\n1. About the format, the 2 in 1 laptops would be the ideal thing? For those who own this format, is it good? Is there something to consider before buying?\n\n2. About the models, are those good? And are there any models I should also be looking for? Also I want to ask for the upgradeability of those models.\n\n3. Do you have any recommendations in general? My maximum budget would be 500 USD but I don't really want to spend more than 400 USD. I'm from Mexico and the money to buy this comes from a scholarship. The normal money I make in my job only serves for survival so saving more is a bit impossible. In case it is relevant, I'm a med student.\n\nAlso I apologise in advance if this doesn't comply with all rules.",

I need some help to choose a new laptop for my school and work.\nI’m an engineering student and also work on game modding/creation, mostly unreal engine and recently the battery of my surface book 2 is giving up. I can’t use it without the plug, the problem is that I have to pay 200€/$ to swap one battery, being 400€ for both and that’s not a option since the laptop is old.\n\nI have been looking around and found some options, but the problem is that idk if they are priced correctly since I only understand about desktop parts and their prices. I’m seeing laptops for 1.2K with RTX 4050 and ryzen 7/9 or intel 13gen, and in my opinion is very overpriced, also the screen is just 1080p with 144hz. For 1.2k I would expect at least a 4060 and 2K.\n\nSo if someone could help me to choose a pc that is good for me I would very grateful.\n\nSome things I want is 2k resolution, a mid range gpu, doesn’t need to be the best since I have a desktop at home and a nice CPU, preferably Ryzen 7/9 or Intel I7/I9 or the ultras. Also a good battery life and preferably a pc that doesn’t sound like an airplane.\nI have no budget, I just want something that is good for the price I pay for it, don’t want to spend money mindlessly.\n\nThank you!\n\n\nEDIT: Preferably 32GB ram since I need it a lot",

    "selftext": "Hello there, I am looking for a new hybrid laptop. So far, I used the surface pro 7 and was very happy with it. But when I bought it, I didn't know much about laptops and just took the one with smallest RAM and storage capacity. I thought about getting another surface pro but got a rant from someone I know about why the way they are built is absolutely shitty (high quality display and other components, but they saved up money on important components, which need to be as good as the other ones to make the laptop functionable, in order to make it affordable for costumers). I looked into alternatives but I have a hard time finding something that matches ehat I need. I want a hybrid laptop with a removable keyboard (without screwdriver or something), that is light to carry around, can be used with a stylus, on which can be used scientific programms like Mestrenova. I need it to have a good RAM, longgevity and storage and to not be over 700€. I'll gladly take any recommendations!",

    "selftext": "Hi, I go to product design university and I need a new computer. I went into a professional shop and they suggested me the zbook line from hp, in particular the G1i 16 with rtx pro 1000 or 2000. I’m probably going to buy the first of the two and I wonder if you know something about these graphics card. I need the laptop it mostly for 3d modeling on rhino, rendering on programs like keyshot and work on 2d programs like photoshop, illustrator and indesign. Do you think the rtx pro 1000 is enough or nah? Consider I don’t need to make giant heavy projects since I’m no architect. My choice is mostly dictated by budget since the one with the rtx pro 1000 is less expensive, otherwise I would obviously choose the other one. Thanks in advance.",

The original screen actually isn't all too bad (for my standards at least) with a 1200×800 resolution and *okay* viewing angles and colors.\n\nI left it torn apart for a year, though I finally got around to upgrading it and cleaning it thoroughly. The cleaning proces was absolutely disgusting, with gunk in every single crevice.\n\nThe new specs include an Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 (64 bit), 2 GB of DDR2, the same horrible GMA 950, and a Teamgroup CX2 256 GB SATA SSD. It feels great with a fresh install of Vista Ultimate 64 bit and Aero enabled, though web browsing is an absolute pain. I tried to opt with Linux first, but I couldn't use GNOME (my favorite DE) without it being so slow, so I ended up using Vista instead.\n\nSome remarks:\n\n-This feels great to type on when I'm in class with an outlet right beside me. The battery only lasts a maximum of 1 hour, so I have to charge basically all of the time.\n-I use Google Classroom and Google Docs often, and this laptop can handle those things fine. However, literally anything more than Reddit and 5 tabs will slow everything down to an unusable mess.\n-I will test Photoshop CS2 when I find a proper copy of it, since it meets the system requirements.",

My plan was to originally return the 7i and pay the extra $100 for the OLED screen, and 2 in 1 capabilities. But when looking again, I found this HP for even cheaper with seemingly better specs. The 2tb SSD seems pretty sweet plus a slightly more powerful processor. What I'm worried about tho is I hear a lot of talk of HP's software and battery life as well as the build quality not being as good as the Lenovo's, so im wondering how true this is, and if it would be worth it to get the HP for the cheaper price, the Ultra 9, and the extra tb of storage. If it matters im currently in high and planning to use the laptop for an IT degree throughout college. Idk if this is correct or not but I think the HP's have more upgradeability as well?

Some totes finally have laptop sleeves, but the *functionality* is still missing  the straps dig into your shoulders, and carrying it all day feels like lifting weights. Why are women’s bags designed only for aesthetics or “flex” and not actual *comfort* or *usage*?\n\nAnd affordable options are even worse. I can’t spend ₹10K on a bag. \n\nIf you’ve felt the same pain, please share in comments — it’ll honestly make me feel better knowing I’m not the only one dealing with this",

    "selftext": "For the context I'm currently a Computer Science student, I have been using macbook (m1, 8/256) for uni for 3 years at this point. I have a PC at home running windows and an ubuntu server that I can ssh into and code on there instead of on my macbook. This macbook has fanstatic battery life, basically it can sustain for multiple days because I only use it for Uni and not at home\n\nHowever lately I have been running into multiple obstacles where I need to use enterprise program (power designer, powerBI, or some processes that just run out of the box on windows but require additional application on mac like android transfer). So currently I'm looking for an alternative for this macbook. Also yes I know I can setup moonlight to my home pc and probably use my ubuntu server to wake up the pc but it's not a reliable thing to do especially when it involves work, also parallel is too expensive and VM is just too slow since it's a base model\n\nThe only requirement would be great battery life and running windows with 16gb or more RAM (preferably x86 since I heard that many programs doesn't support arm processor). I don't really care about the screen so it dont need to be OLED or something like that but if they do have them It's a plus. Budget is 1K Euro, could be new or second hand\n\nAppreciate any recommendation!",

The original screen actually isn't all too bad (for my standards at least) with a 1200×800 resolution and *okay* viewing angles and colors.\n\nI left it torn apart for a year, though I finally got around to upgrading it and cleaning it thoroughly. The cleaning proces was absolutely disgusting, with gunk in every single crevice.\n\nThe new specs include an Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 (64 bit), 2 GB of DDR2, the same horrible GMA 950, and a Teamgroup CX2 256 GB SATA SSD. It feels great with a fresh install of Vista Ultimate 64 bit and Aero enabled, though web browsing is an absolute pain. I tried to opt with Linux first, but I couldn't use GNOME (my favorite DE) without it being so slow, so I ended up using Vista instead.\n\nSome remarks:\n\n-This feels great to type on when I'm in class with an outlet right beside me. The battery only lasts a maximum of 1 hour, so I have to charge basically all of the time.\n-I use Google Classroom and Google Docs often, and this laptop can handle those things fine. However, literally anything more than Reddit and 5 tabs will slow everything down to an unusable mess.\n-I will test Photoshop CS2 when I find a proper copy of it, since it meets the system requirements.",

    "selftext": "So I currently have a Lenovo Yoga 7i pretty the much the same specs as the 9i I would just appreciate the OLED screen and 2-in-1 capabilities. My plan was to originally return the 7i and pay the extra $100 for the OLED screen, and 2 in 1 capabilities. But when looking again, I found this HP for even cheaper with seemingly better specs. The 2tb SSD seems pretty sweet plus a slightly more powerful processor. What I'm worried about tho is I hear a lot of talk of HP's software and battery life as well as the build quality not being as good as the Lenovo's, so im wondering how true this is, and if it would be worth it to get the HP for the cheaper price, the Ultra 9, and the extra tb of storage. If it matters im currently in high and planning to use the laptop for an IT degree throughout college. Idk if this is correct or not but I think the HP's have more upgradeability as well? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m793hhkm83yf1.png?width=2571&format=png&auto=webp&s=92a036802fc9fab1ad1c4a15553ddafaee6532f4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fkn1axn83yf1.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&s=95310f5d6b61cc08a71efb02207b0cb8f0a1488d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjzj0lyo83yf1.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=19e472d4a341c1c4337d4bb16c3f59b56ab8b32b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj3bnlzp83yf1.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a7f3743189b24c803ded5f7df004fcd34b68cdc\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’m diving in to building my first computer soon and I’m making sure I do some proper research before I spend any type of money. It will primarily be a gaming computer (1440) and in the near future can possibly be used for streaming/video editing. ( but it doesn’t have to be if it’s very demanding ) In the event that I can possibly execute both gaming and streaming I was looking for a mid to high level build to not spend to much. Early on I can say my budget is about 1600 give or take 1-300 dollars. I’m willing to spend max 1900 for the build but hoping to stay in the 15-1600 dollar range. \n\nUpon my research, and keeping in mind future upgrades and compatibility, I’ve chosen the 7800x3d over the 7600x. This decision is based solely on the fact that I want to incorporate streaming at a later date. I’ll be grabbing an AM5 motherboard that I haven’t specifically chosen yet, however they are pretty close in price. ( I think it’s a b650 )On part picker I also have all my other components picked out such as the 32 gb ram, the thermalight cooler, power supply, 1 tb ssd, windows 11 OS, and 165hz monitor. \n\nMy dilemma is the gpu. To add, I play games like destiny, smite and every now and then I will play a game like Elden ring. As far as I know, it’s not a heavy payload. But the decision to get the 7800x3d was also affected by whether or not I may want to play more heavy-load games. For the present moment, those are the games I play. I’ve seen many Reddit posts or advice online that says in my situation, downgrade my cpu and upgrade my gpu. The gpus that are recommended are expensive to me and from initial budgeting may put me out of my price range. \n\nBased on what I want and what I can spend, don’t think it’s better for me to push the budget limits and build based on the 7800x3d or should I downgrade to the 7600xt based on my needs, and spend less money in the long run. \n\nI apologize in advance if this is all over the place, and I am also in my beginning stages of research so I am aware my knowledge is limited and if I missed anything or am wrong, I apologize in advance.

Not one of those prebuilt Acers or Lenovo, but assembled at a online retailer who sells PC components.\n\nI was looking at building in a smaller case like NZXT H3, with a newer MOBO wifi7 PCIe 5.0 and Zen 5, AMD CPU, CL 30 Ram, affordable  9700 xt or 5070ti, Kraken Cooler etc, but ended up going for this prebuilt;\n\nNZXT H5 flow\n\n# GeForce RTX 5080 WindForce 3 OC\n\nTUF GAMING B650-PLUS WIFI\n\nRyzen 7 7800X3D\n\nID-Cooling FROZN A620 PRO SE\n\nCorsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 - 32GB CL 36\n\nKingston NV3 SSD\n\nCorsair RMe Series RM850e\n\nNow, I got this prebuilt for just 100 euroes more than what I was going for, and was blinded by the RTX 5080. I now see the mobo, cooling and RAM is a bit outdated. Should I return it, or am I overthinking this? its quite a big investment for me. Looking for input.\n\n  \nEdit, will be gaming at a 2k OLED for now. ",

So in the end its as price to performance as possible since im on a tight budget. \n\nThoughts so far: \nASUS PRIME B660M-K D4 Intel B660 LGA 1700 micro ATX - has xmp and 2 m2 slots. \n\n\nCorsair CX550\n\n\nbe quiet! Pure Rock 3 cpu cooler\n\n\nCrucial E100 M.2 NVMe SSD 1TB\n\n\nSome case that includes fans?\n\nNeed someone smarter to decide if its better to change out some parts for other ones that work the same for cheaper. Or perhaps use a cheaper motherboard and getting a better cpu cooler or something like that. I dont neccessary need two m.2 slots but xmp is nice. This is just a quick build beacause my old pc broke and i cant stand my office laptop for 15 fps gaming anymore. In the near future im planning to build a proper pc and use this as a server or some shit. \n\nAlso IPS 144hz 1080p monitor recommendations will be appreciated, i dont think 240hz is worth it with this build.

I mostly play games on PS5, but would be looking to play PC versions of BF6,  BG3, CP2077, Outer Worlds 2, Forza Horizon 5/6, and maybe dabble with Destiny 2 again at some point.  \n\nI was looking at the RX 9070 XT now that it's popping up around MSRP, but am not sure if my CPU will be a meaningful bottleneck.  I'd be happy with 60 FPS (or better) at Medium settings on most games, and don't mind tweaking settings a bit to get it running smoothly.  Does the 9070 XT make sense for what I have?",

I’m not a hardcore gamer  I just want smooth FPS and good visuals at 1440p.\n\nIn my country, the 9070 XT is about 25% cheaper, and from what I’ve seen, it performs pretty much the same in most games. The 5070 Ti has better ray tracing, DLSS, and higher memory bandwidth, but I don’t really care much about ray tracing  I just want stable shader performance.\n\nSo, do you think the 5070 Ti is still worth the extra money, or should I just grab the 9070 XT and save the cash? Anyone tried Minecraft shaders on either of them? ",

Now I understand it’s unlikely I hit 500fps in BF6, I still want to benefit from the motion clarity and decrease in input lag that this OLED monitor provides. I’m thinking of picking up this build for that very reason. Note that I plan on running BF6 on all low graphics settings regardless so I can get the most fps possible. All critiques, advice, and recommendations are appreciated! \n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/sF8TwP\n",

But about 4 days ago, I started hearing a weird scratching noise coming from it.\n\nAfter some checking, I found that the back fan (since the cooler has two fans) is the culprit. It sounds like the fan is scraping against something or getting slightly stuck when spinning. At first, I was terrified something was broken, but after I removed the back fan (the one with the easy “push-in” mounting system), the noise immediately stopped and the fan spun normally when tested outside the case.\n\nNow every single day when I boot my PC, I have to open the case, remove the fan, and reinstall it, which temporarily fixes the issue until the next shutdown/startup.\n\nMy guess is that the fan might have gotten loose or shifted slightly and it’s now brushing against part of the cooler (maybe the heatsink or hub area?).\n\nHas anyone else run into this issue with the Freezer 36 or other Arctic dual-fan coolers?\nI do have warranty, but honestly I’d rather not go through the hassle of uninstalling the entire cooler and reapplying thermal paste unless it’s really necessary.\n\nAny tips or possible fixes before I contact Arctic support?\nThanks in advance!\n",

    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI recently build a new rig a few days ago with the following specs:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor\n* GPU: PNY Triple Fan Plus OC GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card\n* Motherboard: Gigabyte B650 EAGLE AX ATX AM5 Motherboard\n* Memory: Crucial Pro Overclocking 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL36 Memory\n* Storage: Crucial P3 Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\n* Storage: Crucial MX500 500 GB 2.5\" Solid State Drive (Old SSD I reused)\n* Storage: ASENNO 1TB 2.5 Inch SSD Internal Solid State Drive (Old SSD I reused)\n* Power Supply: Thermaltake Toughpower GT 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply \n* CPU Cooler: Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler\n* Case Fan: Thermalright TL-C12C-S X3 66.17 CFM 120 mm Fans 3-Pack  (x2)\n\nHowever, every time I start a game it crashes within the first 5 minutes. I've tried running the Finals, Counter Strike 2, Alan Wake 2 (I'm going to go loco if I had to replay through that starting scene one more time), etc. Sometimes, my whole system will crash (I can't even pull up task manager) and I'll have to do a hard reboot.\n\nThis is a completely new system. When upgrading, I backed up my important data, wiped my SSDs, did a fresh install of Windows 11 (begrudgingly), and transferred over the important data to the new SSD (2TB M.2 SSD) which has the Windows 11 installation. My old system was using Windows 10 and if you're wondering why I didn't just install my old SSDs into my new system and upgraded Windows 10 to 11, I had it dual-booted with Linux Mint using grub. I ran into some issues with the system not being able to locate the boot manager and boot loaders, so I thought it was easier to just do a fresh install and transfer over the important stuff.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\n* Disabling DLSS: I'm new to DLSS as my last GPU didn't support it, so I thought disabling it might produce better results. Alas, it did not.\n* Disabling Shadowplay: Similiar to my thoughts on DLSS, except I have used this in the past.\n* Installing older GPU drivers: I downgraded to 3 different Nvidia drivers within the last 6 months, but I've had the same problem in all of them.\n\nPossible problems:\n\n* PSU not providing enough power: PCParkPicker estimates that my current power is around 630W. This should be enough for the 850 PSU, but I'm not 100% on PCPartPicker's accuracy.\n* Using an older UEFI BIOS: I'm currently using a slightly older version F34 of the BIOS for my Gigabyte B650 EAGLE motherboard, even though F35 is available. The reason being is that I read PCIe 5.0 is disabled on F35. I know the difference between PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 is negligible, and I'll upgrade if needs be, but I didn't think it would have an effect.\n* GPU doesn't haven enough voltage: My GPU is a factory OC card. I haven't tweaked the clock speed or voltage on my GPU (except for briefly using the Nvidia autotuner tool), but could the factory OC settings be slightly undervolted? GPU-Z tells me that it currently hovers around 0.8V when idle.\n\nI currently assume it's a GPU problem, but I've not idea tbh. Can anyone provide any insights if it is related to this or some other components?\n\nIt's always worth noting that I'm using a 4k monitor with most of these games running on that display resolution.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI recently build a new rig a few days ago with the following specs:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor\n* GPU: PNY Triple Fan Plus OC GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card\n* Motherboard: Gigabyte B650 EAGLE AX ATX AM5 Motherboard\n* Memory: Crucial Pro Overclocking 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL36 Memory\n* Storage: Crucial P3 Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\n* Storage: Crucial MX500 500 GB 2.5\" Solid State Drive (Old SSD I reused)\n* Storage: ASENNO 1TB 2.5 Inch SSD Internal Solid State Drive (Old SSD I reused)\n* Power Supply: Thermaltake Toughpower GT 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply \n* CPU Cooler: Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler\n* Case Fan: Thermalright TL-C12C-S X3 66.17 CFM 120 mm Fans 3-Pack  (x2)\n\nHowever, every time I start a game it crashes within the first 5 minutes. I've tried running the Finals, Counter Strike 2, Alan Wake 2 (I'm going to go loco if I had to replay through that starting scene one more time), etc. Sometimes, my whole system will crash (I can't even pull up task manager) and I'll have to do a hard reboot.\n\nThis is a completely new system. When upgrading, I backed up my important data, wiped my SSDs, did a fresh install of Windows 11 (begrudgingly), and transferred over the important data to the new SSD (2TB M.2 SSD) which has the Windows 11 installation. My old system was using Windows 10 and if you're wondering why I didn't just install my old SSDs into my new system and upgraded Windows 10 to 11, I had it dual-booted with Linux Mint using grub. I ran into some issues with the system not being able to locate the boot manager and boot loaders, so I thought it was easier to just do a fresh install and transfer over the important stuff.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\n* Disabling DLSS: I'm new to DLSS as my last GPU didn't support it, so I thought disabling it might produce better results. Alas, it did not.\n* Disabling Shadowplay: Similiar to my thoughts on DLSS, except I have used this in the past.\n* Installing older GPU drivers: I downgraded to 3 different Nvidia drivers within the last 6 months, but I've had the same problem in all of them.\n\nPossible problems:\n\n* PSU not providing enough power: PCParkPicker estimates that my current power is around 630W. This should be enough for the 850 PSU, but I'm not 100% on PCPartPicker's accuracy.\n* Using an older UEFI BIOS: I'm currently using a slightly older version F34 of the BIOS for my Gigabyte B650 EAGLE motherboard, even though F35 is available. The reason being is that I read PCIe 5.0 is disabled on F35. I know the difference between PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 is negligible, and I'll upgrade if needs be, but I didn't think it would have an effect.\n* GPU doesn't haven enough voltage: My GPU is a factory OC card. I haven't tweaked the clock speed or voltage on my GPU (except for briefly using the Nvidia autotuner tool), but could the factory OC settings be slightly undervolted? GPU-Z tells me that it currently hovers around 0.8V when idle.\n\nI currently assume it's a GPU problem, but I've not idea tbh. Can anyone provide any insights if it is related to this or some other components?\n\nIt's always worth noting that I'm using a 4k monitor with most of these games running on that display resolution.",

My plan is to run proxmox and have two VMs, one linux and one win11pro (for games w/o linux server software).  I understand that most game servers are single threaded so I should look to a faster clock than number of cores.\n\n**Is it worth getting a Ryzen CPU with X3D?**  Will it benefit an effectively headless server?  The sale pitch says the 3D cache is great for single threaded games but I suspect that's only relevant to rendering games, which won't happen on the server obviously.  For comparison, a 9900X is $230 cheaper for me than a 9900X3D.  I expect that will also hold true for the 8 and 12 core chips.\n\nThanks",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’m diving in to building my first computer soon and I’m making sure I do some proper research before I spend any type of money. It will primarily be a gaming computer (1440) and in the near future can possibly be used for streaming/video editing. ( but it doesn’t have to be if it’s very demanding ) In the event that I can possibly execute both gaming and streaming I was looking for a mid to high level build to not spend to much. Early on I can say my budget is about 1600 give or take 1-300 dollars. I’m willing to spend max 1900 for the build but hoping to stay in the 15-1600 dollar range. \n\nUpon my research, and keeping in mind future upgrades and compatibility, I’ve chosen the 7800x3d over the 7600x. This decision is based solely on the fact that I want to incorporate streaming at a later date. I’ll be grabbing an AM5 motherboard that I haven’t specifically chosen yet, however they are pretty close in price. ( I think it’s a b650 )On part picker I also have all my other components picked out such as the 32 gb ram, the thermalight cooler, power supply, 1 tb ssd, windows 11 OS, and 165hz monitor. \n\nMy dilemma is the gpu. To add, I play games like destiny, smite and every now and then I will play a game like Elden ring. As far as I know, it’s not a heavy payload. But the decision to get the 7800x3d was also affected by whether or not I may want to play more heavy-load games. For the present moment, those are the games I play. I’ve seen many Reddit posts or advice online that says in my situation, downgrade my cpu and upgrade my gpu. The gpus that are recommended are expensive to me and from initial budgeting may put me out of my price range. \n\nBased on what I want and what I can spend, don’t think it’s better for me to push the budget limits and build based on the 7800x3d or should I downgrade to the 7600xt based on my needs, and spend less money in the long run. \n\nI apologize in advance if this is all over the place, and I am also in my beginning stages of research so I am aware my knowledge is limited and if I missed anything or am wrong, I apologize in advance.

If I move my cursor around too quickly, switch between tabs or ALT/TAB then it can start to chop and send my mouse to the universe. When I watch videos and it does the same thing then there is yes stuttering but also a static sound from it which really sounds terrible. I have installed Ram correctly in my motherboard. has anyone experienced something similar? who figured it out.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been saving up for months and finally decided to build my first gaming PC instead of buying a prebuilt. I thought it would be straightforward… but holy crap, there’s so much to figure out. Last night I was playing on my phone watching “best 2025 PC build” videos, and every creator has a completely different opinion one says go AMD, the next says Intel, one says air cooling is fine, another says liquid or bust. Now I’m just stuck second-guessing everything.   \nI’ve got around $1,500 saved up and I mostly play FPS and some light editing, but I want the build to last a few years. Is there a simple way to narrow this stuff down without going insane from comparison overload?\n\nWould love any advice or even just hearing what helped other people finally pull the trigger on their first build.",

    "title": "Games Keep Crashing on My New 5070 TI and 7800X3D Build",
    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI recently build a new rig a few days ago with the following specs:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor\n* GPU: PNY Triple Fan Plus OC GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card\n* Motherboard: Gigabyte B650 EAGLE AX ATX AM5 Motherboard\n* Memory: Crucial Pro Overclocking 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL36 Memory\n* Storage: Crucial P3 Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\n* Storage: Crucial MX500 500 GB 2.5\" Solid State Drive (Old SSD I reused)\n* Storage: ASENNO 1TB 2.5 Inch SSD Internal Solid State Drive (Old SSD I reused)\n* Power Supply: Thermaltake Toughpower GT 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply \n* CPU Cooler: Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler\n* Case Fan: Thermalright TL-C12C-S X3 66.17 CFM 120 mm Fans 3-Pack  (x2)\n\nHowever, every time I start a game it crashes within the first 5 minutes. I've tried running the Finals, Counter Strike 2, Alan Wake 2 (I'm going to go loco if I had to replay through that starting scene one more time), etc. Sometimes, my whole system will crash (I can't even pull up task manager) and I'll have to do a hard reboot.\n\nThis is a completely new system. When upgrading, I backed up my important data, wiped my SSDs, did a fresh install of Windows 11 (begrudgingly), and transferred over the important data to the new SSD (2TB M.2 SSD) which has the Windows 11 installation. My old system was using Windows 10 and if you're wondering why I didn't just install my old SSDs into my new system and upgraded Windows 10 to 11, I had it dual-booted with Linux Mint using grub. I ran into some issues with the system not being able to locate the boot manager and boot loaders, so I thought it was easier to just do a fresh install and transfer over the important stuff.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\n* Disabling DLSS: I'm new to DLSS as my last GPU didn't support it, so I thought disabling it might produce better results. Alas, it did not.\n* Disabling Shadowplay: Similiar to my thoughts on DLSS, except I have used this in the past.\n* Installing older GPU drivers: I downgraded to 3 different Nvidia drivers within the last 6 months, but I've had the same problem in all of them.\n\nPossible problems:\n\n* PSU not providing enough power: PCParkPicker estimates that my current power is around 630W. This should be enough for the 850 PSU, but I'm not 100% on PCPartPicker's accuracy.\n* Using an older UEFI BIOS: I'm currently using a slightly older version F34 of the BIOS for my Gigabyte B650 EAGLE motherboard, even though F35 is available. The reason being is that I read PCIe 5.0 is disabled on F35. I know the difference between PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 is negligible, and I'll upgrade if needs be, but I didn't think it would have an effect.\n* GPU doesn't haven enough voltage: My GPU is a factory OC card. I haven't tweaked the clock speed or voltage on my GPU (except for briefly using the Nvidia autotuner tool), but could the factory OC settings be slightly undervolted? GPU-Z tells me that it currently hovers around 0.8V when idle.\n\nI currently assume it's a GPU problem, but I've not idea tbh. Can anyone provide any insights if it is related to this or some other components?\n\nIt's always worth noting that I'm using a 4k monitor with most of these games running on that display resolution.",

My plan is to run proxmox and have two VMs, one linux and one win11pro (for games w/o linux server software).  I understand that most game servers are single threaded so I should look to a faster clock than number of cores.\n\n**Is it worth getting a Ryzen CPU with X3D?**  Will it benefit an effectively headless server?  The sale pitch says the 3D cache is great for single threaded games but I suspect that's only relevant to rendering games, which won't happen on the server obviously.  For comparison, a 9900X is $230 cheaper for me than a 9900X3D.  I expect that will also hold true for the 8 and 12 core chips.\n\nThanks",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’m diving in to building my first computer soon and I’m making sure I do some proper research before I spend any type of money. It will primarily be a gaming computer (1440) and in the near future can possibly be used for streaming/video editing. ( but it doesn’t have to be if it’s very demanding ) In the event that I can possibly execute both gaming and streaming I was looking for a mid to high level build to not spend to much. Early on I can say my budget is about 1600 give or take 1-300 dollars. I’m willing to spend max 1900 for the build but hoping to stay in the 15-1600 dollar range. \n\nUpon my research, and keeping in mind future upgrades and compatibility, I’ve chosen the 7800x3d over the 7600x. This decision is based solely on the fact that I want to incorporate streaming at a later date. I’ll be grabbing an AM5 motherboard that I haven’t specifically chosen yet, however they are pretty close in price. ( I think it’s a b650 )On part picker I also have all my other components picked out such as the 32 gb ram, the thermalight cooler, power supply, 1 tb ssd, windows 11 OS, and 165hz monitor. \n\nMy dilemma is the gpu. To add, I play games like destiny, smite and every now and then I will play a game like Elden ring. As far as I know, it’s not a heavy payload. But the decision to get the 7800x3d was also affected by whether or not I may want to play more heavy-load games. For the present moment, those are the games I play. I’ve seen many Reddit posts or advice online that says in my situation, downgrade my cpu and upgrade my gpu. The gpus that are recommended are expensive to me and from initial budgeting may put me out of my price range. \n\nBased on what I want and what I can spend, don’t think it’s better for me to push the budget limits and build based on the 7800x3d or should I downgrade to the 7600xt based on my needs, and spend less money in the long run. \n\nI apologize in advance if this is all over the place, and I am also in my beginning stages of research so I am aware my knowledge is limited and if I missed anything or am wrong, I apologize in advance.

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms.

Yet all we hear is company XYZ cutting corners, firing staff, poor optimizations, $90 price tag etc. while somehow these companies are also still not making enough money?  \n  \nFor example, how was Infinity Ward/Activision able to make one of the greatest COD games MW2 in 16 months and run on a PS3 with 256mb ram near flawlessly, but I can’t even run Warzone smoothly on low settings on my fucking RTX5070 with 32gb RAM, and they’ve been actively developing/patching that garbage for like 5-7 years? Not to mention the fact they’ve milked revenue from that game the whole time through skins while MW2 was being patched for free.     \n  \n  \nIt sounds stupid, but did these companies forget about saving money by hiring talented people who can manage projects and create quality products within reasonable constraints, who understand limitations and can be creative to work around them? Why are studios hiring people who create garbage then spend a year(s) post production patching the game to make it playable? In the construction industry there’s a saying we use along the lines of, “If you have time to come back and fix it, you had time to do it right the first time.”. \n  \nBit of a rant but also a general curiosity on how this industry has completely evolved to something that doesn’t seem to understand what they’ve got their hands on. This seems like the best time to make unbelievable money and create amazing quality games and it just isn’t happening for some of these big names.\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n",

I think gaming rage comes from a lack of control. \n\nYou can control how YOU play. Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system. Notice how a lot of competitive games are labeled as \"toxic\"? Its because people are always blaming others.\n\nI can't think of a single time where I hard raged in a single player game. Why? Because I know that my perfomance is directly related the only variable; me. \n\nSorry for the yap. Was pooping on the toliet and just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\n",

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ≠ skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \n🎮 Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

    "selftext": "I picked it up yesterday to play with my friends for the first time. I was surprised (in a positive way) at how mechanicaly complex it can be, especially the organizing and reparing the RV part of the game. It seems like the type of game that it's both fun and exciting to master in the long run, BUT I was astonished at how bad it overall works. To the point of taking you out of the immersion multiple times.\n\n\\- This is a physics-based game in which the physics barely work. The rope, the constantly clipping in and out of the RV, the weird collision issues... it's everywhere.\n\n\\- This is a pity, but there's barely a sense of danger or stakes whatosever. From time to time an animal will attack, or there will be a terrain obstacle to overcome, but that's pretty much it. In a way it's cool, this can be a calmer game that, let's say, Peak or REPO. But it also means that in the moment to moment gameplay it can sometimes be somewhat boring, especially because--\n\n\\- This is one of my biggest complaints right now. The multiplayer of this game i feel is not balanced. There were four of us in the RV, and for most of the time, it feels like the game would have worked better with just two. It didn't seem to me like there was much to be done. The person driving has such and advantage mechanically, and there can also be a person looking at the map, but other than that, this is not a Sea of Theves type of thing were EVERY person is needed to manouver the boat. The other two of us were just in the back, seated because you can NOT be walking around the RV while someone's driving because the physics turn crazy. That means it's not a time that you can spend maybe organising the cabinets, playing cards (this is not a mechanic but it would be cool) or something like that.\n\nI want to end on a positive note. Like I said, I really love the premise of the game. It's so unique and full of potential (the chain-smoking is hilarious). If it was well polished and with expanded mechanics, this could be like a land version of Sea of Thieves. But right now is everything but polished. It's so bizarre to me that this is a 1.0 release and not an early access.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe’ve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It’s a fast, chaotic beat ’em up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who’s Mexican, and it’s directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt’s basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It’s been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo’s now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We’ve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that’s part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I’ll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pokémon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community: [https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs.*\n\n*“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” wrote Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Games, in an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg News.*",

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable.

    "selftext": "How were games being developed 10-20 years ago in shorter time frames with extreme technological limitations compared to today, and yet those games were perceived much higher quality while the studios were happy with their profit margins?  \n  \nCompared to today, where you would think that with how far we’ve come with technological advancement that games should be much easier to make, cost far less money to create(especially digital copies reducing disk/case production), and should run far better with the amazing hardware we all have. Yet all we hear is company XYZ cutting corners, firing staff, poor optimizations, $90 price tag etc. while somehow these companies are also still not making enough money?  \n  \nFor example, how was Infinity Ward/Activision able to make one of the greatest COD games MW2 in 16 months and run on a PS3 with 256mb ram near flawlessly, but I can’t even run Warzone smoothly on low settings on my fucking RTX5070 with 32gb RAM, and they’ve been actively developing/patching that garbage for like 5-7 years? Not to mention the fact they’ve milked revenue from that game the whole time through skins while MW2 was being patched for free.     \n  \n  \nIt sounds stupid, but did these companies forget about saving money by hiring talented people who can manage projects and create quality products within reasonable constraints, who understand limitations and can be creative to work around them? Why are studios hiring people who create garbage then spend a year(s) post production patching the game to make it playable? In the construction industry there’s a saying we use along the lines of, “If you have time to come back and fix it, you had time to do it right the first time.”. \n  \nBit of a rant but also a general curiosity on how this industry has completely evolved to something that doesn’t seem to understand what they’ve got their hands on. This seems like the best time to make unbelievable money and create amazing quality games and it just isn’t happening for some of these big names.\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I've been making Skyformer full time since 2021 with both my own game engine and art, and I'm finally announcing the PC Early Access release date on Steam for November 10th 2025. \n\nIt's a first-person survival/automation/crafting game where you're a little robot sent to a planet with the assignment to make it habitable. You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community: [https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs.*\n\n*“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” wrote Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Games, in an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg News.*",

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "I'm asking for help from the community with either buying or building a home pc for my mother in law. She currently has one of those crap prebuilt ibuypower computers from the stone age. It's old enough that without turning it on I can't tell if it's a ddr2 or ddr3 platform. We are in the U.S. and she wants to budget around the $500 range. Her current pc is way out of date and extremely slow even for normal boring home use. I'm pretty sure the slow speed is mostly storage related, but she wants to upgrade to something more up to date, rather than doing minimal upgrading and trying to polish a turd. I own and have built my own computers to use for my sim rig and other gaming, but im only knowledgeable when it comes to higher end hardware specs, and have no solid knowledge about building a lower spec computer. I'm trying to get her the best bang for buck without going overkill with higher end components than what is needed for her use case. We are talking mainly browsing online, watching videos, a bit of microsoft word and excel, and things of that nature. Nothing really overly cpu intensive or super graphically demanding. I don't think she will even need a standalone gpu as long as the cpu has an igpu. I know about intel processors using the F to denote lack of igpu, but I'm clueless when it comes to amd and their cpu integrated graphics naming specs. Any help with this would be very much appreciated. Anything from a parts list, part recommendations, or preferably a prebuilt that fits the requirements and use case. Ddr4 or ddr5 would both be fine as I'm not sure which would currently have the best pricing for the necessary components between the cpu and motherboard. I'd like to avoid proprietary component prebuilds and things like mini computers since they aren't easily upgradable or repairable. Atx or m-atx options only please. Thank you in advance for any help and for your time. ",

Additionally I don’t know if it’s related or not, but while it’s turned on and with no display, if I press something on the keyboard the motherboard sometimes makes this screeching sound.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, my motherboard is the ASUS b450 Plus for reference.",

I've tried going into BIOS to activate and deactivate Secure Boot, tried installing Windows on another SSD, all to the same result.\n\nMy only assumption is that somehow when I formatted the disks and created new partitions, it made the disks back into MBR, and now it's like Secure Boot is off so I can't get into Windows? Any idea what this might be?\n\nUpdate: The bootloop begins after the initial 100% process is done.

After that the the pc came up with a dram issue and the argb fans wouldnt turn on. I flashed the bios only a week ago and it had been working but would black screen occasionally with fans turning to 100% power and the only way to resume usage was to hard boot it with the case power button.

You know, that old mode that's pretty obsolete now and if you tab out you get black screen for a few moments, and it takes longer to tab in and out while also may cause some games to crash. I say old because most games today have either Fullscreen (Borderless Fullscreen) or Windowed.\n\nI digress, the issue is that it only activates in that scenario, I know it's active because my monitor has the built in frame counter option which displays it's current Hz. In borderless, at 90 fps the frame counter is at 240hz, in fullscreen it's the same as the fps.\n\nThis is how my settings look like currently:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgn5utilj2yf1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=17b1183f84c308b536a01696454efc5bad0cb434\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvm1dcsmj2yf1.png?width=1091&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b5154162983454c4d97b1e4e30fc4ad846b30c\n\nIs it a windows related issue? I remember 2 years ago when I used the AW3423DW this issue wasn't happening, and even youtube videos were getting G-Sync'd since I had Enable for windowed and full screen mode toggled.\n\nI already did try to set it for windowed and full screen mode, but it doesn't help with anything.\n\n  \nP.S: The reason I posted here instead of the Nvidia sub is because of the extreme moderation of that sub and extreme defending of Nvidia to the point where anything slightly critical gets deleted, so I wouldn't have gotten the help I needed there!",

It’s literally DOA (Dead on Arrival).\n\nI’m honestly so frustrated — I waited patiently, trusted them, and now they’re blaming me for something that obviously happened in transit or before shipping.\n\nHas anyone here dealt with MSI India support or consumer complaints for local store purchases?

She doesnt expect some top of the line PC, just something that she can get into a make friends, play games online and not be too limited. She is adamant that she doesn't want a laptop also.\n\n  \nShe has been playing Elder Scrolls for years and years, she loves Minecraft, Roblox, and she always talks about wanting to play RDR2 and sometimes talks about being interested in trying Cyberpunk.\n\n  \nI guess I'm obviously most worried about price. I feel like I can spare around 600 (give or take) for the PC, I know I will need to get the peripherals also, but that part I can manage. I'd like to take advantage of Black Friday sales if possible? Can I expect any sales that will get me in this range? If so, where do you all recommend watching?\n\nI used Newegg to enter some games and see what they recommend, but it was recommending some PCs that had integrated graphics cards and saying they will play Cyberpunk at moderate settings, so I'm not trusting it. I'd rather come to Reddit and ask.\n\n  \nThank you all in advance.",

    "selftext": "So, I have a 2-terabyte Kingston Fury Renegade SSD that I bought a little over a year ago. I’m not exactly sure which model it is, but I believe it’s not the latest G5 version. I’ve been considering upgrading to the G5 model, but I’m not sure if it would make a noticeable difference in games—like whether it would help with stuttering or small freezes, or if it’s only about how quickly the game loads. Would a new Kingston Fury G5 really help if I replace my older Kingston Fury, or would it not make much of a difference at all?",

    "title": "Someone in South Korea conducted an ingredient analysis on Amech SGT-4 Thermal Paste",
    "selftext": "Summary\n\n* The product does not contain acetoxy silicone.\n* The product is manufactured in South Korea.\n* The company is currently in operation, and its address has been verified.\n* The company is discussing on verification methods, and exploring possible laboratory tests through certified testing institutions.\n* So, most of the claims made against this product and the company are false.\n\nThe company is a sole proprietorship and is at risk of suspending operations due to this incident. According to the supplier, the product was essentially sold with no profit margin.\n\nThey have neither the assets nor the means to defend themselves, so we are responding on their behalf. There is no issue with this product. The person who posted on Quasarzone kept modifying the content of the post while demanding compensation, then eventually withdrew the demands and left.\n\n[original link(dcinside SFF Gallery)](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=sff&no=1456811)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odpdxzea4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=c906d10a7957c8ebb74b370bed42c54227e8e8eb\n\nFig. 1. MSDS of SGT-4 posted on the AMeCh homepage Most thermal-paste products use polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, often called \"silicone oil\") as a dispersing medium, and disperse heat-transfer media such as Al2O3 (alumina). I confirmed from the attached photo that SGT-4 also uses PDMS and alumina, etc. But in the issue raised by Igor Lab, the ingredient causing the sour smell was suggested to be acetoxy silicone (acetoxy silane), and AMeCh asserted that it is not. So I treated the question of whether acetoxy silane was added to SGT-4 as the point of contention, and I did an analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mje10mdt5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=fed09c9f69e2b172fbf14e473bd56495f4e455d8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vue0nw6g4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bbf92d1120d32a163ff499d6465d1a1fb43b88d\n\nFig. 2. a) photo of SGT-4 separated by centrifuge using nhexane as solvent, b) after removing organic layer with rotary evaporator First, since PDMS or acetoxy silane are both organics, in order to extract the organic matter from SGT-4 I used a centrifuge to separate out the organic layer; in the filtering process I used a 0.2 µm syringe filter to catch any inorganic particles that might have gotten in. Then I evaporated the filtered solution to isolate the organic matter inside SGT-4 alone, and did 1H NMR measurement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mc36gmru5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=57ee11762c1e4e4a8075185c565e344efcbea7d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxffrg6j4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=8028a8d52024fb35e705f19eb5f6cd57d375723d\n\nFig. 3. a) certificate of the PDMS measured as control, b) NMR spectrum of that sample If you studied organic chemistry you know roughly what NMR is: hydrogen atoms in organics are influenced by nearby atoms and take particular positions and shapes in the spectrum, and the integrated area of each peak is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms - so you can infer structure from it. As shown in the certificate in Fig. 3, the PDMS in question has a terminal -OH group accounting for 1.4% by mass; interpreting together with the NMR result: since the spectrum is measured relative to TMS as standard, given PDMS with Si-CH3 bonded to the Si atoms, we expect a peak very close to 0 ppm from Si-CH3, and at 2.12 ppm we measured the broad -OH peak characteristic of the terminal -OH. Because the terminal OH mass ratio is 1.4%, if you reversecalculate the ratio of OH: CH3 integration, you get roughly 98 : 1 - considering it is a polymer NMR this is reasonably consistent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptta1gvl4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=727b31f1ac87443d8f8e2fdc7b8b53c0ed5dcf12\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si6zd69m4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=5646b1b6511ee2e567794d1a5bd0cb3f74f63ea5\n\nFig. 4. NMR spectrum of organic matter extracted from SGT-4 Now let's look at the SGT-4 result. The reason I posted two spectra is that the CH3 peak is so distinct that minor peaks get buried in it unless you zoom in. Compared to the control, there appear to be many small peaks. That's because in NMR the peak intensity is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms being measured; even if it's a mixture, if one hydrogen atom type is detected a lot then the remaining hydrogen types inevitably appear relatively small. Anyway, in the result we observe, just like in the control, a prominent Si-CH3 peak is detected, and the remaining peaks are likely due to additives, or possibly the PDMS used is not a typical linear structure but something branched or otherwise modified - there are various possibilities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yuj1u4p4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bfeeea4330e1e66be2edf9583bde10f0f84fc4c\n\nFig. 5. Molecular structures of various kinds of acetoxy silanes However, if you look at the structure of acetoxy silane, they commonly share an acetyloxy group (O=C-CH3). The CH3 of that functional group is characterized by a peak around \\~2.0 ppm. I enlarged it quite a bit but I did not observe a peak in that region. Now you might argue \"Well if acetoxy silane is included in a very small amount then it might not be detectable by NMR, right?\" But in the first place, if something is present only to the point where you can't see it on NMR, is that amount enough to give off a detectable smell when it oxidizes and humans smell it? That's what I wonder.\n\nConclusion: In the sample I measured, I did not see the 1H proton peak attributable to the acetyloxy group of acetoxy silane. Even if an extremely small amount was added and not detected, I'm of the opinion that at this level of non-detection it would be hard for humans to even smell it in the first place. I'm not sure whether I will additionally measure IR or DSC at the current stage.\n\n\\-> A full translation of original report by dcinside sff gallery user\n\nFurthermore -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tdyrp8z4zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a396337027b01b8f556aa757c1ca2c77719b97f\n\nBusiness registration certificate (Amech)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2rqem655zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=666112fd0b760afeff4b1e4547230c3bf0ecb71a\n\noffice(a apartment style factory/지식산업센터), Room 504\n\n경상북도 포항시 북구 흥해읍 융합기술로 66, 504(포항지식산업센터)\n\n[Road View](https://map.naver.com/p/search/%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,%20504%28%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%A7%80%EC%8B%9D%EC%82%B0%EC%97%85%EC%84%BC%ED%84%B0%29/address/14395620.4671225,4309151.0136731,%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,new?c=18.01,0,0,0,adh&isCorrectAnswer=true&p=hqnmZMQfY2hmxuyOb5DYsw,-119.09,11.82,80,Float) \\- naver maps",

She doesnt expect some top of the line PC, just something that she can get into a make friends, play games online and not be too limited. She is adamant that she doesn't want a laptop also.\n\n  \nShe has been playing Elder Scrolls for years and years, she loves Minecraft, Roblox, and she always talks about wanting to play RDR2 and sometimes talks about being interested in trying Cyberpunk.\n\n  \nI guess I'm obviously most worried about price. I feel like I can spare around 600 (give or take) for the PC, I know I will need to get the peripherals also, but that part I can manage. I'd like to take advantage of Black Friday sales if possible? Can I expect any sales that will get me in this range? If so, where do you all recommend watching?\n\nI used Newegg to enter some games and see what they recommend, but it was recommending some PCs that had integrated graphics cards and saying they will play Cyberpunk at moderate settings, so I'm not trusting it. I'd rather come to Reddit and ask.\n\n  \nThank you all in advance.",

    "title": "Someone in South Korea conducted an ingredient analysis on Amech SGT-4 Thermal Paste",
    "selftext": "Summary\n\n* The product does not contain acetoxy silicone.\n* The product is manufactured in South Korea.\n* The company is currently in operation, and its address has been verified.\n* The company is discussing on verification methods, and exploring possible laboratory tests through certified testing institutions.\n* So, most of the claims made against this product and the company are false.\n\nThe company is a sole proprietorship and is at risk of suspending operations due to this incident. According to the supplier, the product was essentially sold with no profit margin.\n\nThey have neither the assets nor the means to defend themselves, so we are responding on their behalf. There is no issue with this product. The person who posted on Quasarzone kept modifying the content of the post while demanding compensation, then eventually withdrew the demands and left.\n\n[original link(dcinside SFF Gallery)](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=sff&no=1456811)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odpdxzea4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=c906d10a7957c8ebb74b370bed42c54227e8e8eb\n\nFig. 1. MSDS of SGT-4 posted on the AMeCh homepage Most thermal-paste products use polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, often called \"silicone oil\") as a dispersing medium, and disperse heat-transfer media such as Al2O3 (alumina). I confirmed from the attached photo that SGT-4 also uses PDMS and alumina, etc. But in the issue raised by Igor Lab, the ingredient causing the sour smell was suggested to be acetoxy silicone (acetoxy silane), and AMeCh asserted that it is not. So I treated the question of whether acetoxy silane was added to SGT-4 as the point of contention, and I did an analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mje10mdt5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=fed09c9f69e2b172fbf14e473bd56495f4e455d8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vue0nw6g4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bbf92d1120d32a163ff499d6465d1a1fb43b88d\n\nFig. 2. a) photo of SGT-4 separated by centrifuge using nhexane as solvent, b) after removing organic layer with rotary evaporator First, since PDMS or acetoxy silane are both organics, in order to extract the organic matter from SGT-4 I used a centrifuge to separate out the organic layer; in the filtering process I used a 0.2 µm syringe filter to catch any inorganic particles that might have gotten in. Then I evaporated the filtered solution to isolate the organic matter inside SGT-4 alone, and did 1H NMR measurement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mc36gmru5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=57ee11762c1e4e4a8075185c565e344efcbea7d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxffrg6j4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=8028a8d52024fb35e705f19eb5f6cd57d375723d\n\nFig. 3. a) certificate of the PDMS measured as control, b) NMR spectrum of that sample If you studied organic chemistry you know roughly what NMR is: hydrogen atoms in organics are influenced by nearby atoms and take particular positions and shapes in the spectrum, and the integrated area of each peak is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms - so you can infer structure from it. As shown in the certificate in Fig. 3, the PDMS in question has a terminal -OH group accounting for 1.4% by mass; interpreting together with the NMR result: since the spectrum is measured relative to TMS as standard, given PDMS with Si-CH3 bonded to the Si atoms, we expect a peak very close to 0 ppm from Si-CH3, and at 2.12 ppm we measured the broad -OH peak characteristic of the terminal -OH. Because the terminal OH mass ratio is 1.4%, if you reversecalculate the ratio of OH: CH3 integration, you get roughly 98 : 1 - considering it is a polymer NMR this is reasonably consistent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptta1gvl4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=727b31f1ac87443d8f8e2fdc7b8b53c0ed5dcf12\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si6zd69m4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=5646b1b6511ee2e567794d1a5bd0cb3f74f63ea5\n\nFig. 4. NMR spectrum of organic matter extracted from SGT-4 Now let's look at the SGT-4 result. The reason I posted two spectra is that the CH3 peak is so distinct that minor peaks get buried in it unless you zoom in. Compared to the control, there appear to be many small peaks. That's because in NMR the peak intensity is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms being measured; even if it's a mixture, if one hydrogen atom type is detected a lot then the remaining hydrogen types inevitably appear relatively small. Anyway, in the result we observe, just like in the control, a prominent Si-CH3 peak is detected, and the remaining peaks are likely due to additives, or possibly the PDMS used is not a typical linear structure but something branched or otherwise modified - there are various possibilities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yuj1u4p4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bfeeea4330e1e66be2edf9583bde10f0f84fc4c\n\nFig. 5. Molecular structures of various kinds of acetoxy silanes However, if you look at the structure of acetoxy silane, they commonly share an acetyloxy group (O=C-CH3). The CH3 of that functional group is characterized by a peak around \\~2.0 ppm. I enlarged it quite a bit but I did not observe a peak in that region. Now you might argue \"Well if acetoxy silane is included in a very small amount then it might not be detectable by NMR, right?\" But in the first place, if something is present only to the point where you can't see it on NMR, is that amount enough to give off a detectable smell when it oxidizes and humans smell it? That's what I wonder.\n\nConclusion: In the sample I measured, I did not see the 1H proton peak attributable to the acetyloxy group of acetoxy silane. Even if an extremely small amount was added and not detected, I'm of the opinion that at this level of non-detection it would be hard for humans to even smell it in the first place. I'm not sure whether I will additionally measure IR or DSC at the current stage.\n\n\\-> A full translation of original report by dcinside sff gallery user\n\nFurthermore -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tdyrp8z4zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a396337027b01b8f556aa757c1ca2c77719b97f\n\nBusiness registration certificate (Amech)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2rqem655zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=666112fd0b760afeff4b1e4547230c3bf0ecb71a\n\noffice(a apartment style factory/지식산업센터), Room 504\n\n경상북도 포항시 북구 흥해읍 융합기술로 66, 504(포항지식산업센터)\n\n[Road View](https://map.naver.com/p/search/%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,%20504%28%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%A7%80%EC%8B%9D%EC%82%B0%EC%97%85%EC%84%BC%ED%84%B0%29/address/14395620.4671225,4309151.0136731,%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,new?c=18.01,0,0,0,adh&isCorrectAnswer=true&p=hqnmZMQfY2hmxuyOb5DYsw,-119.09,11.82,80,Float) \\- naver maps",

She doesnt expect some top of the line PC, just something that she can get into a make friends, play games online and not be too limited. She is adamant that she doesn't want a laptop also.\n\n  \nShe has been playing Elder Scrolls for years and years, she loves Minecraft, Roblox, and she always talks about wanting to play RDR2 and sometimes talks about being interested in trying Cyberpunk.\n\n  \nI guess I'm obviously most worried about price. I feel like I can spare around 600 (give or take) for the PC, I know I will need to get the peripherals also, but that part I can manage. I'd like to take advantage of Black Friday sales if possible? Can I expect any sales that will get me in this range? If so, where do you all recommend watching?\n\nI used Newegg to enter some games and see what they recommend, but it was recommending some PCs that had integrated graphics cards and saying they will play Cyberpunk at moderate settings, so I'm not trusting it. I'd rather come to Reddit and ask.\n\n  \nThank you all in advance.",

I'm thinking about putting up some white string lights around the area, but I'm still on the fence about it.\n\nI'm also planning to swap out the colorful poster for a white one, but I'm unsure if I should add some shelves, more pictures, or posters, or if there's something else I should consider. I definitely need better lighting in that corner, which is why I'm leaning towards those string lights.\n\n(My pc will be off the ground in a bit. I just built it.\n\nI’d love any suggestions you might have! Thanks for taking the time!",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

You can find the rest of my posts here, where I'm posting a keyboard every week for a whole year, 52 boards, with 6 down and 46 more to go.\n\nWeek 1: [Vertex Arc60](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1npcvs7/im_posting_a_picture_of_a_different_mechanical/)  \nWeek 2: [Lazydesigners Cloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1ntnjbu/im_posting_a_keyboard_a_week_for_the_next_year/)  \nWeek 3: [Sneakbox AVA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1nzmknb/im_posting_a_keeb_a_week_this_is_week_3_sneakbox/)  \nWeek 4: [Viktus Styrka](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1o5mc5w/week_4_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_for/)  \nWeek 5: [Hola Mini](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1obmwjr/week_5_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_a_year/)\n\nOf course, since I'm going through the trouble to document all of these boards after building such a large collection, I've been adding their finer details to a the [cataloging and sharing app Keebuilder](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/), this way I'll eventually have all of my builds and the parts used in a single place.

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks — band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast 🙂.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me — in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn’t make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they’ll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly — The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay’s voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away → Roxette**  \nI’m still in love with Marie Fredriksson’s voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 → Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele — the man, the music, the attitude — pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F → Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The “3” also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit — Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 → 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it’s probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive →** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt’s pure freedom, soul, happiness — life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins… and hopefully Bart’s story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy — build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power → N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote “tuurnn” next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in — just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane →** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane — the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations →** had to be here anyway, but this one’s a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song’s energy, Mark’s wild teenage years, his early work — all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we’re at it…\n\n**P.I.J M.M → Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite — the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE → Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come Through* would’ve been too many “dreams” — and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire → Scooter (HP Baxxter’s voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in Pécs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously — the best element!\n\n**Out of Space → The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under “Space”, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune’s “I was sent to outer space,” and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can’t Stop Raving* didn’t fit anymore 😅.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True →** basically the slogan of the ’90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven’t outgrown it — and honestly, “growing up” was never my strong suit 🙂.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? →** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I’ve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here — sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** — doesn’t need explaining, but I shouldn’t forget it either.\n* **NRG** — same energy.\n* **Music** — the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** — cliché, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** — probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** — took a while to find. Wanted something that says “I don’t fit in boxes,” kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** — because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** — as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** — one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny “-drive,” because if it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn’t stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches… the works.\n\nThat’s about all that fit — for now.  \nI’ve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer — brush smears the paint, and I don’t want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway… I’ve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the ***Logitech G915 TKL*** and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the *G515* with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the ***Keychron K1 Max*** with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using [launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/) but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use [usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’ve got a couple of questions about the Cycle keyboards:\n\n1. I’m currently using the **Cycle 3 tri-mode**, and I’m wondering if anyone knows how to change or customize the keymap on it? I’ve looked around but couldn’t find a clear guide or software that works. Any tips or links would be super helpful.\n2. I also have a Cycle 7, but unfortunately, I lost its wireless receiver. Does anyone know if it’s possible to pair it with a new receiver, or if there’s a way to buy a replacement dongle directly from the manufacturer?\n\nThankss",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I just bought a new monitor and due to its cheap stand and also my unstable desk, when I type, it wobbles a lot. I reduced the wobble by pushing my desk forward to the point it touches the wall behind it, now when I type, the monitor wobbles but not enough so I would notice without focusing on it wobbling. This is all I could do for now and I searched through the posts in here and saw that people suggested mounting the monitor to the wall or buying a monitor arm or even buying a better desk, I may do those in the future when I make the budget. But a question came into my mind; can constant wobbling caused by typing damage the internals of the monitor in\nlong term? For example damaging the panel itself and worsening the backlight bleed for IPS panels or causing any other issue. Can the guys who used their monitor with a little of wobbling in years give me a little review of what has happened to their monitors. ",

But not sure if I’d suffer for work. I use a MacBook Pro and access my work via Microsoft Remote Desktop. So I’m not sure if it the app will split over both screens or not?\n\nI do have a Sony Bravia 4k 55” TV that I used to use the PS4/5 on but haven’t got it set up in my man cave (the only available wall it could go on is fairly small and may look ridiculous with the TV on it - plus I’d have to wall mount the PS5, too…)\n\nSo, I’m in a bit of a pickle on what to do.

    "selftext": "I’ve been trying for several months to find a decent IPS monitor for both graphic work and gaming, somewhere around **€600**. I’m looking for a **4K** monitor, but my previous purchase was the **ASUS ProArt Display PA278CGV**, which I was actually  happy with. Even though it’s only **2.5K**, I was ready to live with that — but for some reason, maybe because of the *crystalline effect* or something else, it felt extremely *blurry*, even compared to other 2.5K monitors I use at work. And, of course, it couldn’t compare to 4K at all.\n\nYesterday I received the **MSI MPG 274URDFW E16M**, and I’m a bit disappointed — mainly with the panel quality. The monitor has quite noticeable darkening along the edges and a brightness shift depending on the viewing angle, which creates a slight tunnel effect. On top of that, the overall build quality feels somewhat cheap.\n\nMy current monitor, the **LG 27UP85NP-W**, doesn’t have any of these image issues — but it’s only **60 Hz**. All I want is a monitor with *at least 120 Hz* and a *good IPS panel*.\n\nI realize that I might be asking for too much and that my requirements are quite specific — but the search goes on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nc78blpt70yf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d1c86f8edc4e03f644963f71c8af760099439d5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4yfdl9v70yf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97018cd130ec8ba0d7937efd73a1399ee69e912f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uongpggw70yf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ec2801f9025a417c5ee34b55b6116a24f8ea8a6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7q5zfz3x70yf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=256a73dce310264931d00e48bc61ce2ad5c0e314\n\n",

A simple search via VESA's website does not display this model (or family). I also reached out to Innocn's support, and they admitted it had not been certified. At least they were honest? In the conversation, they stated it is currently not in process either. \n\nHow common is it for monitors to actually get certified after it has already been released? I have only ever seen it prior to release.\n\nHow much does this actually matter?\n\nIs the process to get certified expensive? I know some of their other models do have certifications. \n\nI know monitors can still hit the spec,  just have not been officially certified, but it does not appear to be the case here. According to this video from China, if I am reading this correctly it would be unable to adhere to the spec anyway.

Everything looks and plays awesome, high quality etc. if I watch Amazon Prime or Disney+ everything looks amazing too with good quality, \n\nbut if I watch YouTube it looks not so good, I'm guessing that's because the monitor and ps5 are set to 2160p but normal YouTube videos run at 1080p or 720p, so they just forcefully get upscaled and turn out to look not so good. My question is can I do something about this so that I can watch YouTube videos in 1080p 720p and make it look ok or good?\n\n(Setting the ps5 to 1080p or 720p doesn't help or look better either.)\n\nI'm not very deep into technical spec's so everything helps if you got questions just ask.\n\nThank you",

Yesterday the resolution randomly switched to 1440x900 and I cannot switch it back, it now says that is the recommended resolution.  I have tried updating the driver through device manager and setting a custom resolution through the AMD driver but neither work.  The research I've done leads me to believe that the solution would be to install a WHQL driver, but the one for this specific model are not available on the ASUS website, and when I have tried third party drivers, it says that it does not contain digital signature information or something like that.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.",

It done this every now and then before it decided to completely die but turning on and off would fix it or unplugging and replugging it. Now though nothing will fix it. I have tried different cables both HDMI and DP cables, different ports on both graphics cards in my pc. Different resolutions, different refresh rates. Tried with my macbook too on different resolutions and refresh rates and this is where I'm at now. Ive got it connected to macbook and im at 1080p 120hz is what I have it set to but when the monitor is turned on it is making crackly sparking noises. As if it is sparking and wants to catch fire and/or blow up. So I am not doing anymore testing with it now. Would anyone know if its possible to take apart and inspect and potentially fix it? I dont know when I got it but if I had to guess it would be 2-3 years ago and probably is out of return warranty window so I might be done for with it. \n\n  \nAny help and advice greatly appreciated.

    "selftext": "(see my edit at the bottom)\n\nSince my one year anniversary of getting the AW3423DWF on a Black Friday deal last year was coming up I thought I'd throw some grey slides up to see how it was handling burn-in. Well... as you can see, not great. Unfortunately, now that I know it's there I'm seeing it all the time in dark scenes. I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.\n\nEdit: I have a theory as to why this burn-in was particularly bad in case other people read this post later. Yes, icons and wallpaper contributed, but others have mentioned that they haven't see such dramatic burn in even with those. Ever since I got this monitor I've been struggling to keep it in standby when not in use, despite having a 5 minute black screensaver and 10 minute standby. I would find it randomly awake and it wouldn't go back to sleep unless I forced it. I'd see it sleep and then immediately wake up, or walk away and come back to find it on. (I'm talking about the monitor, not PC).\n\nWell, I think I fixed it after finding another thread on this: **input auto-select needs to be turned off in the monitor menu**. For some reason it would keep it from sleeping properly. I just tried it and it worked perfectly and now immediately enters the pixel refresh like it's supposed to. I have a feeling that this bug was kicking it out of standby constantly and not letting it do a refresh every four hours, despite being set to. That would have definitely made burn in worse if it was only doing it at night when I shut the PC off and not during the day.\n\nNo idea if this is the smoking gun, but it likely contributed.",

    "selftext": "I wanna replace my current monitor which is a 24\" samsung C24F390 curved monitor. I wanna upgrade to something with a higher resolution as I play a lot of simulators (Farming sim, MSFS and DCS) so probably 1440p or 4K for the stunning graphics. But I also play fps games mostly CS2. Ive been looking but i cant decide. Some people suggest a Ultra wide 4k monitor for msfs. some suggest just a 1440p normal monitor. Curved for immersion but flat for fps games? IDK what to choose. Im planning on after getting the new preferably  it being bigger. I have 40 inches of horizontal space  but Im hoping to DIY my samsung into a vertical monitor by sawing off the stand and rotating it 90°. I dont have a set budget but maybe max high £100 to low £200s. Any suggestions?  Im planning on changing out my lamp for one that hangs off the side of the desk so it doesnt take up room.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spof3qwx4xxf1.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=34a313ac61cbc4e8df6bb10178b7e5b0277898e3\n\n",

    "selftext": "I currently have a Samsung Odyssey G5 (Curved 27-Inch, 144hz, 1440p).  \nFor what it's worth, I use a NVIDIA RTX 4080 super and an Xbox Series X.\n\nI use it for gaming mostly, and some GIS projects and general productivity. I've had it for nearly two years now, and it has been great for me. I know Samsung is not known for their quality when it comes to monitors, but I have had no dead pixels or anything that I can tell, so maybe I just got one of the lucky ones. I just started a new job and I want to treat myself to a new monitor. At first I was looking at getting something of the same size/specs to match, but then I figured why not consider other options as well. \n\nSIZE\n\n* I have a 27in now, but I've been considering a 32in. I think I would appreciate the larger size, but I know that means I may want to consider going to 4k instead of 1440p, and that's a big price jump. \n* Side note: would a 27in next to a 32in might look strange?\n* Also, my current monitor is curved, which wasn't my first choice, but it isn't an aggressive curve and I don't mind it. Why are curved panels less expensive most of the time?\n\nREFRESH RATE\n\n* I am happy with 144hz and above, I can't tell much of a difference past that point. \n\nRESOLUTION\n\n* From my (limited) understanding know you can't always use 120fps and 4k simultaneously, and must choose performance or quality for some applications. I prefer performance gaming to visual quality, but I definitely still want the most out of my system. \n* Also, if I go with a 32in I've heard that 4k is better for screens of that size... If I spend extra money on a 32in monitor is it worth it to go for 4k?\n\nSo does anyone have any recommendations? I want to wait until black friday for some good sales anyways. I'm looking to spend less than $400 but if it's worth it to spend more, I'm willing to do so I'll just want to wait a bit longer and hold out for now.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I’m choosing first monitor 27-inch/1440p, and I’m confused about the choice. Since I have a VA panel TV, I prefer VA, but based on monitor reviews, everyone recommends choosing IPS.\nI went to an store, and they only had the Samsung G5 (curved VA and flat IPS) available. At first glance, they looked the same, but the VA had terrible viewing angles. That's strange—the viewing angles on my TV are great, and I actually replaced it when I first bought an IPS from LG that had horrible black levels and washed-out colors.\nSo, the review from the RTINGS website confused me, where it said: \"Distracting VRR flicker with changing frame rates.\"\nI mainly play CP2077, where I get around 90-120fps, and Warzone, where I get about 140fps.\nHow will the monitor behave at such frame rates? Will there be flickering?\nMy device is a laptop with an RTX 4050.\nAlso, I have a external RX7800. I might build a full PC in the future, but I also hooked it up via M2 just to get some extra FPS. The only thing I'm really concerned about, though, is how games will look when I'm not getting crazy 180Hz frame rates, since I won't hit 180fps+ every game.\n\nI’m also worried about whether it will be possible to watch movies at 24/30 fps on such a monitor. Or will they flicker?\nMy laptop has an IPS panel, and surprisingly, it’s decent, but I have no way to compare it to separate IPS monitors.\nI ordered an AOC Q27G4X (IPS) arriving, but I doubt I should keep it. I’m afraid of getting poor black color/levels. However, all the reviews I've watched for VA monitors mentioned they have very poor viewing angles, ghosting/smearing, slow response, and flicker... and yes, I'm not ready to buy an OLED...",

    "title": "One year on an AW3423DWF and I thought I had escaped burn-in. Narrator: He did not.",
    "selftext": "(see my edit at the bottom)\n\nSince my one year anniversary of getting the AW3423DWF on a Black Friday deal last year was coming up I thought I'd throw some grey slides up to see how it was handling burn-in. Well... as you can see, not great. Unfortunately, now that I know it's there I'm seeing it all the time in dark scenes. I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.\n\nEdit: I have a theory as to why this burn-in was particularly bad in case other people read this post later. Yes, icons and wallpaper contributed, but others have mentioned that they haven't see such dramatic burn in even with those. Ever since I got this monitor I've been struggling to keep it in standby when not in use, despite having a 5 minute black screensaver and 10 minute standby. I would find it randomly awake and it wouldn't go back to sleep unless I forced it. I'd see it sleep and then immediately wake up, or walk away and come back to find it on. (I'm talking about the monitor, not PC).\n\nWell, I think I fixed it after finding another thread on this: **input auto-select needs to be turned off in the monitor menu**. For some reason it would keep it from sleeping properly. I just tried it and it worked perfectly and now immediately enters the pixel refresh like it's supposed to. I have a feeling that this bug was kicking it out of standby constantly and not letting it do a refresh every four hours, despite being set to. That would have definitely made burn in worse if it was only doing it at night when I shut the PC off and not during the day.\n\nNo idea if this is the smoking gun, but it likely contributed.",

So far im really happy with it but i just cant seem to decide if i made the right decision going with the 27inch screen (Buyers remorse as always) Everything is so smooth and crispy but i just keep reading online comments about missing out on the immersion of a 32inch screen and \"wasting the performance drop for a 27inch screen\". Im just asking if someone else has tried both and which one was the \"correct choice\". I know that PPD is more important than PPI but i do sit fairly close to the monitor. I just feel like its not as immersive as i thought it would. The 32Inch that id be going for would be the PG32UCDM. ",

This is all I could do for now and I searched through the posts in here and saw that people suggested mounting the monitor to the wall or buying a monitor arm or even buying a better desk, I may do those in the future when I make the budget. But a question came into my mind; can constant wobbling caused by typing damage the internals of the monitor in\nlong term? For example damaging the panel itself and worsening the backlight bleed for IPS panels or causing any other issue. Can the guys who used their monitor with a little of wobbling in years give me a little review of what has happened to their monitors. ",

However, my main concern isn’t really burn-in — it’s text clarity.\n\nI’ve read quite a bit about fringing and subpixel rendering issues at this pixel density (around 110 PPI at 3440x1440), and since I spend most of my day reading and writing code, I just can’t compromise on text sharpness or clarity.\n\n**For those coding on OLED daily:**\n\n* Does text rendering work for you after several hours?\n* Eye fatigue vs IPS?\n* Does burn-in with IDE/toolbars worry you?\n* Does your monitor have USB-C power delivery?\n\nGiven my intensive text usage, does OLED seem suitable or is it a risky bet? \n\nAny IPS alternatives to recommend?\n\nThanks for your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I currently have the Samsung LS34J550WQUXEN monitor (34” ultra wide) and it’s done me well for the last 5 years. I use it daily for work and also have my PS5 connected to it. I enjoy it due to how much space I have available for productivity at work, but wondering if I’m missing out in terms of gaming.\n\nI’ve been looking at possibly buying two AOC 27Inch Q27G42XNE 180Hz QHD Gaming Monitor and selling my ultra wide to do so (due to some vouchers I’d likely be able to not pay a penny in the switch).\n\nI’m just wondering whether it’d be beneficial for me to do so?\n\nI know my current monitor is just 60Hz, so I’d benefit there. But not sure if I’d suffer for work. I use a MacBook Pro and access my work via Microsoft Remote Desktop. So I’m not sure if it the app will split over both screens or not?\n\nI do have a Sony Bravia 4k 55” TV that I used to use the PS4/5 on but haven’t got it set up in my man cave (the only available wall it could go on is fairly small and may look ridiculous with the TV on it - plus I’d have to wall mount the PS5, too…)\n\nSo, I’m in a bit of a pickle on what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated as I’m not really that clued up with these things!",

    "selftext": "(see my edit at the bottom)\n\nSince my one year anniversary of getting the AW3423DWF on a Black Friday deal last year was coming up I thought I'd throw some grey slides up to see how it was handling burn-in. Well... as you can see, not great. Unfortunately, now that I know it's there I'm seeing it all the time in dark scenes. I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.\n\nEdit: I have a theory as to why this burn-in was particularly bad in case other people read this post later. Yes, icons and wallpaper contributed, but others have mentioned that they haven't see such dramatic burn in even with those. Ever since I got this monitor I've been struggling to keep it in standby when not in use, despite having a 5 minute black screensaver and 10 minute standby. I would find it randomly awake and it wouldn't go back to sleep unless I forced it. I'd see it sleep and then immediately wake up, or walk away and come back to find it on. (I'm talking about the monitor, not PC).\n\nWell, I think I fixed it after finding another thread on this: **input auto-select needs to be turned off in the monitor menu**. For some reason it would keep it from sleeping properly. I just tried it and it worked perfectly and now immediately enters the pixel refresh like it's supposed to. I have a feeling that this bug was kicking it out of standby constantly and not letting it do a refresh every four hours, despite being set to. That would have definitely made burn in worse if it was only doing it at night when I shut the PC off and not during the day.\n\nNo idea if this is the smoking gun, but it likely contributed.",

Im just asking if someone else has tried both and which one was the \"correct choice\". I know that PPD is more important than PPI but i do sit fairly close to the monitor. I just feel like its not as immersive as i thought it would. The 32Inch that id be going for would be the PG32UCDM. ",

This is all I could do for now and I searched through the posts in here and saw that people suggested mounting the monitor to the wall or buying a monitor arm or even buying a better desk, I may do those in the future when I make the budget. But a question came into my mind; can constant wobbling caused by typing damage the internals of the monitor in\nlong term? For example damaging the panel itself and worsening the backlight bleed for IPS panels or causing any other issue. Can the guys who used their monitor with a little of wobbling in years give me a little review of what has happened to their monitors. ",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, so I am kind of new in the tech world and I am trying to find some affordable monitor for ps5. **Acer Nitro xf273uxbmiiprx** or **Lenovo Legion 27Q-10**? I am really unsure, because it's my first time buying a monitor and I don't know if **VA (Acer)** panel or **IPS (Lenovo)** panel will be better for movies and console gaming. I play mostly story games or action games, but I think I would hate smearing, but at the same time I would want to have kind of good black (it doesn't have to be like in VA but a little darker than in IPS). They are both my max budget so maybe you have some other recommendations in this price range? **I really need help ASAP.** \n\nI live in Europe (Poland) so I don't have all options available.\n\n[Lenovo Legion 27Q-10](https://preview.redd.it/mlyw5q9su2yf1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6641af4ba6679c8d8f3f6b79911a3524f3e0ab9)\n\n[Acer Nitro xf273uxbmiiprx ](https://preview.redd.it/ndrrr15ju2yf1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=023b60bf838f58f7ee7be054304360839147b2a8)\n\nI will be very happy with any help :)  \n\n\n",

However, after testing them for a while, I noticed a few issues:\n\t•\tThe XM5 actually sounds fuller and more bodied than the XM6. The XM6 feels smoother and less fatiguing during long listening sessions, but I also noticed a slight drop in bass impact compared to the XM5.\n\t•\tThe PX7 S3, on the other hand, is a completely different story. The sound quality is amazing — much richer, more powerful, and detailed than both the XM5 and XM6. It’s the kind of sound that makes you feel the music. But because of its strong low end and bright highs, it becomes tiring after a few songs.\n\nSo basically:\nThe XM6 is relaxing, but lacks emotion.\nThe PX7 S3 is exciting, but that excitement can be exhausting.\nAnd honestly, the ANC difference between the XM6 and PX7 S3 is on another level — the XM6's noise cancelling is just miles ahead.\nNow I'm stuck between comfort, emotion, and practicality.\n\nIf you were in my position - already owning the XM5\n— which one would you pick as your second pair?\nWould you go for the PX7 S3 for that immersive, emotional sound even if it's fatiguing over time, or would you choose the XM6 for its balance, better ANC, and overall smoother experience ?

    "selftext": "So I previously had upgraded from some generic brand headphones to the JBL Quantum One's. They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

    "selftext": "I work a desk job where I'm on the phone at least half the day. I got sick of the provided headset so I bought this set for work, being wireless, good battery life, good mic features (that noise fence tech is the real MVP). Usually I'll wear these over a set of flathead IEMs when I'm on the phone. These can do dual connection with BT and the usb dongle, just never really thought to use them for my phone. I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

    "selftext": "Today I received the brand-new FiiO K13 R2R DAC/AMP, which I picked up mainly out of curiosity to explore the sound signature of R2R technology. My current setup includes the Topping DX5 II, which absolutely shines with electronic genres (rave, techno, acid, house, IDM, EDM) you name it.. It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That’s exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I’ll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you’ve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

But this is my office, and although I do have a nice stereo system here, headphones are sometimes more adequate. I've recently got a pair of Sennheiser HD600s, powered by a Fiio K11 R2R, and they work fine.\n\n  \nPerhaps my questions are more on the subject of headphones than of this one in particular, maybe. I use Sonus Faber Sonettos here, and I absolutely love them. The headphones just seem \"constrained\" maybe. I am not good at describing such things. But they seem to be lacking \"openness\" and some space. Don't know if it's the HD600s, the amp, or just the nature of headphones themselves, being placed in your head for example, I know their weight may be a factor, I don't know, just not feeling it.\n\n  \nHope any of you can relate and give me some advice, thank you all!",

    "selftext": "I listened to both back-to-back, and both sounded amazing, but I definitely felt like the Ananda Nano was clearer and on every track, and you could definitely notice a difference. \n\nHowever, people kept saying the Edition XS bass is better than the Nano, but I felt the Nano's bass hit harder, and sometimes felt like it was overdone. \n\nFor example, I played Drakes “From Time”, and the bass sounded boomy, different to how my AirPods Pro 2, Edifier R2000DB and how the Edition XS presenter the bass - they all sounded correct. Nano’s bass sounded overdone Sort of similar to how the AirPods Pro 3 sounded, like it was too V-shaped. I prefer a neutral headphone with a slight V-emphasis. I don’t understand why the Nano would present the bass in this way given everyone has said it’s a neutral headphone. Can this bass be EQ’d?\n\nThe XS sounded perfect, but the Ananda Nano sounded a bit boomy. But on every other track, the bass sounded tight and great, and there was just more separation and overall clarity on the Ananda Nano. But people kept saying it's like an analytical, dry headphone. I'm open to EQing it, like I have an EQ software on my PC, but what would you recommend between the two of them?",

    "selftext": "*TL:DR for those who are short on time or not willing to read the full review:*\n\n# Pros:\n\n* Overall versatile and non-fatiguing signature that will work well for most people\n* Comfortable to wear and pretty sturdy considering that they’re mostly made of plastic\n* Come with a coiled wire that’s a very appreciated thing for those who DJ\n* The ANC isn’t up to par with more mainstream bluetooth headphones but it’s still decent enough considering the price\n* Strong electronic noise-cancellation when using the microphone\n* Good battery life \n* Multipoint bluetooth\n\n# Cons:\n\n* The fit is very inconsistent and leads to differences in sound that depend on how the headphones fit on the head and ears of the listener\n* The RGB lighting is for gamers, the overall style is for DJs, and the bluetooth connectivity is not used by neither of these types of users: the product is rather confusing\n* Hard to use outdoor: very specific DJ design and the ANC produces some occasional pops because of street bumps/potholes (if you commute)\n* No AptX/LDAC\n* The strong noise cancellation of the microphone is welcomed in very busy environments but it’s very aggressive and sometimes cuts some parts of the voice\n\n# ————————————————————————————\n\n# Introduction\n\nKiwi Ears is a very popular brand in the Chi-Fi industry for their IEMs, but lately they have been entering the over-ear space with some cans. In this review, I’ll be speaking about the Kiwi Ears Ardor, a pair of Wireless Over Ear headphones with ANC capabilities and sold for a competitive listing price.\n\n>*Disclaimer: the Kiwi Ears Aventus were sent to me by Kiwi Ears so that I could write an honest review. This review represents my personal opinion on the set, it isn't promotional or paid content and I don’t get any revenue from the sales of this product.*  \n*At the time of the review, the Kiwi Ears Aventus were on sale for about $72.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4giq7q011yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee4768ab389034deee24688b0c66af6a709d16cd\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Type of headphone → Over-Ear\n* Driver Configuration → Dual DD 40mm + 10mm coaxial\n* Bluetooth version → 5.4, supporting SBC and AAC codecs (no AptX, no LDAC) +  low-latency mode\n* Bluetooth range → 8-10m (free open environment)\n* ANC → Hybrid ANC, noise reduction depth -32B±3dB\n* Battery capacity and declared battery life → 1000mAh, for a total of about 18hrs with ANC+RGB ON, 45hrs with ANC ON and 82hrs with ANC OFF\n* Fast charging → Yes, 10 mins of charge correspond to 4 hours of playback (with ANC OFF)\n* Frequency response → 20Hz-40KHz\n* Impedance → 16Ω ± 10% @ 1KHz\n* Sensitivity → 102dB ± 3dB @ 1KHz 1mW\n* Weight → 290g (measured on my own non-professional scale)\n* Charging port → Type-C\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus come well packed and the box contains:\n\n* The Kiwi Ears Aventus\n* A Detachable Audio cable\n* A USB Type-C charging cable\n* A USB Type-C charging data cable\n* One pair of tuning foam pads\n* A User Manual\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pai8tu1211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32969399057b4033a0436c5ea40f887de653a619\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wvslc2211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9efb4d8248c5ec6bca280f13fac1bff2531f3a08\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ronqcdr311yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c12208d2b329ec81ee43216ecbae80d793fd5442\n\n# Design, Build Quality, Comfort and Isolation\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus look very “DJ”-ish, with a pretty thick junction between the earcups and the sliders and a large headband. The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn’t seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90°C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don’t cheap when clicked since there’s enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more “premium” (but that’s just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn’t have the chance to test the full 45  hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone’s bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren’t objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it’s pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven’t experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you’ll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you’re not getting Bose-like ANC you’re still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I’m on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn’t emphasize things too much making them almost “artificial” and I think it’s definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn’t low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you’re playing games and want a wireless set, I don’t think this is the right one, it’s just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don’t even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven’t encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let’s talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you’re going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review. \n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it’s there in the right quantity with average speed. It’s not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don’t hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn’t rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren’t fatiguing and they never become hot, and I’d say that they’re not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn’t fatiguing but there’s some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some “S” sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don’t really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn’t very spacious, but it’s okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I’d say but no true bad words to spend here either. \n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I’d say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I’d say it’s usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons: \n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of “inconsistent” sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they’re performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it’s the smarter choice between the two if you don’t wanna charge it as frequently as you’d do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that’s objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it’s a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not “bad” per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren’t big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it’s more of a “perceived” clarity” up top but it doesn’t really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I’d say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

I use it to drive my hd660s2 as well but I’m not sure if it would handle it well. My intuition told me the sound needs to be amplified as it’s a little lack of brightness but I also saw someone saying it’s just the sound signature of this headphone.

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Ω) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Ω), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

I think they deserve the hype in their neutral / out-of-the-box EQ. They cherry pick lots of great qualities and bundle them into a class defining package. I am happy they hit the price point they do. They feel made with love and care for anyone that loves high quality sound. They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

Cellular calls they seem to not work or it sounds like I am miles away. What’s app voice messages have the same issue. Memo’s app recordings are fine.\n\nI’m returning them tomorrow!",

    "selftext": "A few days ago, I decided to get into EQing and came across Equalizer APO with Peace. After following some guides and videos, I managed to set everything up successfully.\n\nI then applied Oratory’s EQ profile for the Sennheiser HD560S ([link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vjyepkimg31sb2tjpprnl/Sennheiser-HD560S.pdf?rlkey=fei2h8kkt2qda6rc6f9qf69ti&e=2&dl=0)). The issue I’m facing now is that while the volume in Windows (YouTube/Spotify) sounds fine, the in-game audio becomes very quiet when using this EQ profile, even at max volume.\n\nOratory suggests increasing amplifier gain, but I don’t currently have an amp, just my motherboard driving the 560S. After checking some Reddit threads, I made a shortlist of potential DAC/amp options, but I’m unsure which one would best solve the issue and remain future-proof (in case I switch to something like IEMs or Beyerdynamics later).\n\nHere are the options I’m considering (considering I am EU based):\n\n* FiiO K11\n* FiiO K5 Pro\n* Topping DX3 Pro+\n* FX-Audio DAC-X6 Mini HiFi 2.0\n* Fosi Audio Q4\n* Any other alternative that I might have missed and is better than the above ones\n\nP.S. don't go too hard on me, I am all new to EQ and DACs/AMPs.",

It's a tool to create personalized EQ settings for your headphone on your head, and it's focused on convenience and usability.\n\nWe have now created a how-to video that shows how we (the creators) use the tool. The approach shown in the video is only one of multiple possible ways and there's more information in the Q&A section.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo)\n\nNote: You will need an EQ app like EqualizerAPO / Peace or EqMac to comfortably listen to music and other things on your system -- the Owliophile tool is only there to help you find the right settings.\n\nWe're planning to make more videos on the technical / theoretical background, as well as explaining all details of the tool, so if you're curious you are welcome to subscribe to the channel. Anyway, I hope this first one serves as a good and practical introduction to the topic of personalized equalization for some of you.\n\nCheers!  \nOwlio",

    "title": "Audeze LCD 2C - One Month Review",
    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

Now, just disregard audio quality completely. I'm just talking noise cancelling with ANC. How is it that airpod pro 3s beat the xm5 in noise cancellation with ANC on? I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

    "selftext": "I've never in my entire life, having visited more than 10 different audio shops around Asia, South East Asia, NA and Oceania-- have I ever encountered a store that makes me feel as unwelcome and as bothersome to the staff as I have in Addicted to Audio. \n\nI was greeted at the door, that's great. But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed. Sometimes the staff outright ignored me, completely unbothered, clicking away on his phone/laptop when the room is completely silent and just the two of us, when I made a comment or asked a question. \n\nI've gotten responses like \"Huh? Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

    "title": "Lets talk about the new Edition XV",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let’s talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I’ve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me — like being wrapped in honey. You’ll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It’s thick, elastic, and feels like it’s hugging the sides of your ears. It’s not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It’s the wet, creamy kind — like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro’s bass FEELS more aggressive. It’s like a scholar delivering an insult — refined, yet every word cuts deep. There’s more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there — it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I’m just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that’s not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY  different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That’s not necessarily good or bad — it’s all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they’re more refined but also smoother — which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro’s vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason — it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks — songs like city pop — take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I’d describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you’re tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That’s what the Edition XV feels like. It won’t shock you, it won’t thrill you — it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft — no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it’s the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage — the Edition XV’s lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro’s stage is even smaller, but it doesn’t have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it’s the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it’s Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth’s do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it’s a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it’s very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn’t too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren’t for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can’t wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I’ll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it’s a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

My set is: \n\n• Grado RS2x \n• HiFiman Subdara (2020)\n• Schiit Vali 2++\n• Schiit Modi\n\nI’ve had the Grados for a couple of years now and every time I use them it reminds me why i got into this “hobby” in the first place. Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x’s is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock—pretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can’t imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They’re far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have “arrived” with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren’t well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it’s just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they’ve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I’d dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up’s as well I’d love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

    "title": "Kefine Delci AE: When spectacularity becomes art",
    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn’t hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don’t want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I’ve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn’t stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65€**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn’t have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle… but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let’s look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn’t have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone’s auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn’t tangle, and doesn’t pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don’t know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn’t find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn’t fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone’s intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn’t the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn’t interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don’t feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don’t need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors’ tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don’t know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can’t believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let’s talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn’t be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos’ very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn’t the highest resolution experience I’ve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let’s go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it’s the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn’t the best for purists since listening wasn’t fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don’t want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I’ve tested. At least up to the **100€/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what’s the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn’t perfect. In fact, technically, it’s inferior to two other competitors in its price range I’ve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I’m not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn’t hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you’ve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

    "title": "Myer Audio SLIIVO SL224 Earphones Review",
    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe radius of the metal part of the sound guide is 6.25 mm. in the thick end part and 5.55 in the main part.\n\nThe outer inserts are made of natural mother-of-pearl placed under a layer of transparent plastic. Mother-of-pearl mysteriously shimmers in the light, and small defects only emphasize the natural origin of the material and are not noticeable in reality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uo0fwmj7ruxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4057aa4590b0ca2e33a8365e4e610daf0a21b1b8\n\nThe connector pad is flat, it is slightly recessed into the housing. The compensation hole is covered with a plastic grate fused into the housing.\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore – [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics – they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Ω and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Ω.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment – it’s almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones – [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound… I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with. No painful sharp vocals.\n\nIs this a common problem among people? And is having to perform such a big EQ change even acceptable?  \nAm i experiencing this because I have a weird HRTF?  \nPerhaps any owners of the AR5000 that can give their thoughts and experience with this?",

    "title": "In the market: DCA Noire XO or E3?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

I stopped using these headphones about a year ago. The ear cups I've changed multiple times in the past, that's not that much of an issue. The yellowing of the white plastic is also expected (these are from literally the first batch of Virtuosos when they were just released in 2019). BUT THE HEADBAND! The headband started peeling off not that long ago and then it started to quickly deteriorate after that. I stopped using the Virtuoso and started using my Raycons instead, then I got my Nothing Ear. They have been ok, but at the same time, the Virtuoso is there in a corner, forgotten and neglected, but it is an amazing headset and I'd really like to get back to using it.\n\n  \nThey still work! I haven't put them on for obvious reasons (they have of course gotten much worse after not being touched for a while in a humid environment), but they still work.  \nI do not need headphones. I don't even game anymore. But sometimes I just want to use them and I can't in their current state.\n\nI also want to note I'm neither an audiophile nor a consumerist, and that's why I wouldn't even consider replacing them instead of just fixing them up a little bit if they still work just fine.",

The best way I can describe it, these sound meaty and impactful while still being detailed and spacious. While the 6xx sounds kind of thin and boxed in by comparison\n\nNot to say the 6xx is bad, they are great. These edition XV are just better. These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable. It's fine.\n\n\n\nVery happy with them so far. I find it hard to want to use anything else. I would be perfectly happy with these as my open back and Aeon Closed RT as my closed back for the forseeable future.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for €150 in Europe two years ago, have been around €110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to €71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the €300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

    "selftext": "Here's a trimmed down version of my full review over on head-fi. You can find it [here](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/aune-n7.28592/reviews).\n\n# Aune N7 Review — Mojo 2 Finds Its Match\n\nAfter upgrading to the Hifiman Arya Stealth, I wanted a proper Class A amp to bring out their full potential. I’ve long used the Chord Mojo 2 as my main DAC/amp — a brilliant device — but I suspected pairing it with a pure Class A amp might unlock something new. Enter the **Aune N7**.\n\n# Build & Design\n\nCompact, solid, and purposeful — the **N7**’s machined aluminum chassis with side heat fins looks serious and feels premium. The **volume knob** clicks smoothly but can skip if turned too fast. The **aluminum remote** feels fantastic, though its **volume buttons** could be better placed.  \nThe **display** is functional but small; no brightness control. As expected from a Class A amp, it runs warm — hand-warmer warm, not egg-frying hot. The internal temperature stays around 45°C even after long sessions.\n\n# Listening Setup\n\n**Chain:** Spotify Lossless → WiiM Mini → Mojo 2 → Aune N7 → Hifiman Arya Stealth (balanced out, high gain/high current).\n\n# Sound Impressions\n\n* **Steely Dan – “Aja”**: The N7 adds depth and weight, expanding the soundstage front-to-back. Bass gains texture; cymbals smooth out; the sax solo feels more alive. Some upper-mid sparkle is softened, but the trade-off is cohesion.\n* **Bill Evans Trio – “Sunday at the Village Vanguard”**: The sense of space and realism jumps. You don’t just hear LaFaro’s bass — you feel it resonate. Evans’ piano takes on body and warmth, and brushwork on the snare is wonderfully tactile.\n* **Snarky Puppy – “We Like It Here”**: A perfect showcase for the N7’s Class A dynamics. Everything stays tight and layered even in dense sections. You lose a touch of bite on transients, but gain richness and flow.\n* **Martha Argerich – Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3**: The Mojo alone is precise but dry. Add the N7 and the sound breathes — the piano has weight and the hall ambience comes alive.\n* **Entheogenic – “Dreamtime Physics”**: Electronica gains dimension and slam. Sub-bass digs deeper, highs shimmer smoothly, and the sound feels enveloping. The N7’s black background lets microdetails emerge effortlessly.\n\n# Tonal Character\n\nThe **N7** sits between **neutral and warm**, adding body without syrup. It turns the Mojo 2’s clinical precision into a more natural, organic presentation — like switching from a microscope to a beautifully developed photo. Mids are dense, bass tight, highs extended yet smooth.\n\n# Noise & Power\n\nAbsolutely silent, even at high gain. The Arya Stealth reaches satisfying levels around 10–15/30 volume steps, leaving plenty of headroom. Rated at **6.5W @ 32Ω balanced**, the N7 drives demanding planars effortlessly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe **Aune N7** is a **$399 Class A gem** — compact, powerful, and genuinely musical. It transforms the Mojo 2 from analytical to alive, and makes the Arya Stealth sound more organic and fatigue-free.  \nIf you want long, engaging sessions and real Class A smoothness without spending big or cluttering your desk, this is the one. Mine’s staying put — and that’s the best endorsement I can give.",

    "selftext": "Today I received the brand-new FiiO K13 R2R DAC/AMP, which I picked up mainly out of curiosity to explore the sound signature of R2R technology. My current setup includes the Topping DX5 II, which absolutely shines with electronic genres (rave, techno, acid, house, IDM, EDM) you name it.. It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That’s exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I’ll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you’ve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

The XM6 feels smoother and less fatiguing during long listening sessions, but I also noticed a slight drop in bass impact compared to the XM5.\n\t•\tThe PX7 S3, on the other hand, is a completely different story. The sound quality is amazing — much richer, more powerful, and detailed than both the XM5 and XM6. It’s the kind of sound that makes you feel the music. But because of its strong low end and bright highs, it becomes tiring after a few songs.\n\nSo basically:\nThe XM6 is relaxing, but lacks emotion.\nThe PX7 S3 is exciting, but that excitement can be exhausting.\nAnd honestly, the ANC difference between the XM6 and PX7 S3 is on another level — the XM6's noise cancelling is just miles ahead.\nNow I'm stuck between comfort, emotion, and practicality.\n\nIf you were in my position - already owning the XM5\n— which one would you pick as your second pair?\nWould you go for the PX7 S3 for that immersive, emotional sound even if it's fatiguing over time, or would you choose the XM6 for its balance, better ANC, and overall smoother experience ?

    "selftext": "So I previously had upgraded from some generic brand headphones to the JBL Quantum One's. They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn’t seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90°C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don’t cheap when clicked since there’s enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more “premium” (but that’s just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn’t have the chance to test the full 45  hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone’s bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren’t objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it’s pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven’t experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you’ll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you’re not getting Bose-like ANC you’re still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I’m on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn’t emphasize things too much making them almost “artificial” and I think it’s definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn’t low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you’re playing games and want a wireless set, I don’t think this is the right one, it’s just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don’t even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven’t encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let’s talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you’re going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review. \n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it’s there in the right quantity with average speed. It’s not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don’t hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn’t rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren’t fatiguing and they never become hot, and I’d say that they’re not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn’t fatiguing but there’s some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some “S” sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don’t really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn’t very spacious, but it’s okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I’d say but no true bad words to spend here either. \n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I’d say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I’d say it’s usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons: \n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of “inconsistent” sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they’re performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it’s the smarter choice between the two if you don’t wanna charge it as frequently as you’d do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that’s objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it’s a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not “bad” per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren’t big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it’s more of a “perceived” clarity” up top but it doesn’t really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I’d say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

I think they deserve the hype in their neutral / out-of-the-box EQ. They cherry pick lots of great qualities and bundle them into a class defining package. I am happy they hit the price point they do. They feel made with love and care for anyone that loves high quality sound. They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

Nano’s bass sounded overdone Sort of similar to how the AirPods Pro 3 sounded, like it was too V-shaped. I prefer a neutral headphone with a slight V-emphasis. I don’t understand why the Nano would present the bass in this way given everyone has said it’s a neutral headphone. Can this bass be EQ’d?\n\nThe XS sounded perfect, but the Ananda Nano sounded a bit boomy. But on every other track, the bass sounded tight and great, and there was just more separation and overall clarity on the Ananda Nano. But people kept saying it's like an analytical, dry headphone. I'm open to EQing it, like I have an EQ software on my PC, but what would you recommend between the two of them?",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using the HD660S for about a week, and at first everything sounded amazing except the bass. EDM didn’t feel punchy enough, and I kept craving more low-end.\n\nBut today - about 10 days in, after listening to them a couple of hours every day, I suddenly find them incredibly well-balanced. The bass now feels thick, tight, and punchy. Nothing seems missing. And I went through the exact same EDM playlist I used for my initial test, so it’s not a matter of different recordings.\n\nHow did my brain just auto adjust like that? Did my perception or sensitivity to bass change over time so that the HD660S now sound perfectly balanced to me?\n\nNow I’m honestly confused about what a normal level of bass even is. If I switch to a headphone with objectively stronger bass, it’ll probably sound too much..until my brain adapts again. That’s wild.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this with headphones?",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed. Sometimes the staff outright ignored me, completely unbothered, clicking away on his phone/laptop when the room is completely silent and just the two of us, when I made a comment or asked a question. \n\nI've gotten responses like \"Huh? Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Ω) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Ω), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it’s Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth’s do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it’s a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it’s very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn’t too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren’t for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can’t wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I’ll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it’s a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

My set is: \n\n• Grado RS2x \n• HiFiman Subdara (2020)\n• Schiit Vali 2++\n• Schiit Modi\n\nI’ve had the Grados for a couple of years now and every time I use them it reminds me why i got into this “hobby” in the first place. Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x’s is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock—pretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can’t imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They’re far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have “arrived” with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren’t well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it’s just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they’ve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I’d dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up’s as well I’d love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones.

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

I got sick of the provided headset so I bought this set for work, being wireless, good battery life, good mic features (that noise fence tech is the real MVP). Usually I'll wear these over a set of flathead IEMs when I'm on the phone. These can do dual connection with BT and the usb dongle, just never really thought to use them for my phone. I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

However, after testing them for a while, I noticed a few issues:\n\t•\tThe XM5 actually sounds fuller and more bodied than the XM6. The XM6 feels smoother and less fatiguing during long listening sessions, but I also noticed a slight drop in bass impact compared to the XM5.\n\t•\tThe PX7 S3, on the other hand, is a completely different story. The sound quality is amazing — much richer, more powerful, and detailed than both the XM5 and XM6. It’s the kind of sound that makes you feel the music. But because of its strong low end and bright highs, it becomes tiring after a few songs.\n\nSo basically:\nThe XM6 is relaxing, but lacks emotion.\nThe PX7 S3 is exciting, but that excitement can be exhausting.\nAnd honestly, the ANC difference between the XM6 and PX7 S3 is on another level — the XM6's noise cancelling is just miles ahead.\nNow I'm stuck between comfort, emotion, and practicality.\n\nIf you were in my position - already owning the XM5\n— which one would you pick as your second pair?\nWould you go for the PX7 S3 for that immersive, emotional sound even if it's fatiguing over time, or would you choose the XM6 for its balance, better ANC, and overall smoother experience ?

That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

    "selftext": "*TL:DR for those who are short on time or not willing to read the full review:*\n\n# Pros:\n\n* Overall versatile and non-fatiguing signature that will work well for most people\n* Comfortable to wear and pretty sturdy considering that they’re mostly made of plastic\n* Come with a coiled wire that’s a very appreciated thing for those who DJ\n* The ANC isn’t up to par with more mainstream bluetooth headphones but it’s still decent enough considering the price\n* Strong electronic noise-cancellation when using the microphone\n* Good battery life \n* Multipoint bluetooth\n\n# Cons:\n\n* The fit is very inconsistent and leads to differences in sound that depend on how the headphones fit on the head and ears of the listener\n* The RGB lighting is for gamers, the overall style is for DJs, and the bluetooth connectivity is not used by neither of these types of users: the product is rather confusing\n* Hard to use outdoor: very specific DJ design and the ANC produces some occasional pops because of street bumps/potholes (if you commute)\n* No AptX/LDAC\n* The strong noise cancellation of the microphone is welcomed in very busy environments but it’s very aggressive and sometimes cuts some parts of the voice\n\n# ————————————————————————————\n\n# Introduction\n\nKiwi Ears is a very popular brand in the Chi-Fi industry for their IEMs, but lately they have been entering the over-ear space with some cans. In this review, I’ll be speaking about the Kiwi Ears Ardor, a pair of Wireless Over Ear headphones with ANC capabilities and sold for a competitive listing price.\n\n>*Disclaimer: the Kiwi Ears Aventus were sent to me by Kiwi Ears so that I could write an honest review. This review represents my personal opinion on the set, it isn't promotional or paid content and I don’t get any revenue from the sales of this product.*  \n*At the time of the review, the Kiwi Ears Aventus were on sale for about $72.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4giq7q011yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee4768ab389034deee24688b0c66af6a709d16cd\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Type of headphone → Over-Ear\n* Driver Configuration → Dual DD 40mm + 10mm coaxial\n* Bluetooth version → 5.4, supporting SBC and AAC codecs (no AptX, no LDAC) +  low-latency mode\n* Bluetooth range → 8-10m (free open environment)\n* ANC → Hybrid ANC, noise reduction depth -32B±3dB\n* Battery capacity and declared battery life → 1000mAh, for a total of about 18hrs with ANC+RGB ON, 45hrs with ANC ON and 82hrs with ANC OFF\n* Fast charging → Yes, 10 mins of charge correspond to 4 hours of playback (with ANC OFF)\n* Frequency response → 20Hz-40KHz\n* Impedance → 16Ω ± 10% @ 1KHz\n* Sensitivity → 102dB ± 3dB @ 1KHz 1mW\n* Weight → 290g (measured on my own non-professional scale)\n* Charging port → Type-C\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus come well packed and the box contains:\n\n* The Kiwi Ears Aventus\n* A Detachable Audio cable\n* A USB Type-C charging cable\n* A USB Type-C charging data cable\n* One pair of tuning foam pads\n* A User Manual\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pai8tu1211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32969399057b4033a0436c5ea40f887de653a619\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wvslc2211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9efb4d8248c5ec6bca280f13fac1bff2531f3a08\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ronqcdr311yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c12208d2b329ec81ee43216ecbae80d793fd5442\n\n# Design, Build Quality, Comfort and Isolation\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus look very “DJ”-ish, with a pretty thick junction between the earcups and the sliders and a large headband. The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn’t seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90°C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don’t cheap when clicked since there’s enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more “premium” (but that’s just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn’t have the chance to test the full 45  hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone’s bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren’t objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it’s pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven’t experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you’ll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you’re not getting Bose-like ANC you’re still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I’m on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn’t emphasize things too much making them almost “artificial” and I think it’s definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn’t low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you’re playing games and want a wireless set, I don’t think this is the right one, it’s just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don’t even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven’t encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let’s talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you’re going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review. \n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it’s there in the right quantity with average speed. It’s not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don’t hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn’t rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren’t fatiguing and they never become hot, and I’d say that they’re not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn’t fatiguing but there’s some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some “S” sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don’t really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn’t very spacious, but it’s okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I’d say but no true bad words to spend here either. \n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I’d say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I’d say it’s usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons: \n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of “inconsistent” sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they’re performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it’s the smarter choice between the two if you don’t wanna charge it as frequently as you’d do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that’s objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it’s a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not “bad” per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren’t big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it’s more of a “perceived” clarity” up top but it doesn’t really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I’d say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

Was on PC RPGs in the 90s but didn’t do much since then until 2020 when I got a switch Lite, and 2022 when I got a gaming laptop. \n\nFirst impression of steam deck was a little underwhelming after all the rabid fanfare on YouTube.\n\n1. Ergonomics are fine? Feels like cheap plastic, which is fine given that’s what’s light and durable. But why everyone says this feels like a Mercedes? I found switch lite more comfortable.\n\n2. Software is fine? Why did it come with 100+ pieces of bloat despite reviewers saying no bloat? \n\n3. Only 7 of my ~30 steam games are verified.. I guess that was a little disappointing. Not super worried here as I’m sure most will play fine. But sort of a weird UX to see a folder saying only 7 of your games are good to go.\n\n4. It’s been a little rough adjusting to this format. Elden Ring text hard to read, Rogue Trader controls pretty unintuitive. I’m sure I’ll work this out in time but it’s not been the super easy pick-up-and-go experience I foresaw.\n\nNot trying to hate just sharing honest first thoughts.",

I decided that I would repair it myself since it might be faster than trying to send it back to Valve. I bought a replacement battery and spent some stressful minutes trying to remove the dead battery. After removing it I gently installed my new battery and brought my deck to the charger and was relived to see %1 battery life. I am not used to repairing expensive electronics myself and am so happy that I am holding a charge again. The picture below is the kit that I used for anyone needing to do this repair in the future.

Ive done research on all the different brands and models of handhelds and I have decided to go with the Steam Deck OLED 1TB. A few months back I got really into gaming controllers and did research on different kinds before ultimately getting a SCUF brand, FLYDIGI brand, and a GameSir to see what I enjoyed most and after experimenting with these different premium controllers ive found out what I really like when it comes to them. Because of this I was wanting to mod my steam deck a little bit to make it a little more comfortable. i was going to order all of the things I wanted to mod it with as well as the deck all at the same time and wanted to make sure I was getting the right stuff as well as get some insight from people who have tried these different things. Here are a list of the things I was going to order:\n\neXtremeRate Face Clicky Kit for Steam Deck OLED\n\nPlayVital Back Button Enhancement Set\n\nGuliKit Hall Effect Joystick Module\n\nDBRAND project killswitch case \n\nIve read some bad things about the GuliKit joysticks and I really want the ElecGear TMR sticks but I dont know how to solder nor do I really want to fool with learning how. What is your opinion on them if you have them?",

Wth?)\n\nAnyway today is just bad, the steam deck didnt want to connect on wifi at all tried restarting it. After restart it connects straight away, stays connected for about 20min then it randomly disconnects and it wont connect again. If i want it to connect again i need to restart, works 20 min, disconnects, and all this all over again. \n\nAnyway my question is, wth is going on? Whats wrong with it? \n\nTook good care of it, never dropped it, didn't game while charging, this never happened before, always connected.\n\nTried developer mode, dekstop mode (same same, makes me think is more a linux problem then a steam deck problem?) tried forgeting the networks, tried multiple networks, wifi works fine on other devices and worked well on steam deck before today as well. Today i did over 10 restarts in order to troubleshoot and im just stuck, i dont know what to do, found some old forums talking about the problem but not much about how to fix it.

    "selftext": "Steam Deck LCD 64GB / Official Valve Dock / Samsung LS29E790\n\nI've scoured multiple Reddit threads & articles, am currently over a week into troubleshooting, and am getting the sense that the docked experience is unreliable for any setup that isn't HDMI to a 16:9/1080 screen.\n\nAny time I've tried docking to an Ultrawide, or docking via DisplayPort, or worse, doing both at the same time, it's a nightmare. I've tried/toggled/experimented with all of the below settings & approaches:\n\n* Automatically Scale User Interface\n* External Display Safe Mode (from both the \"Display\" and \"Developer\" menus - **plus**, this one keeps toggling itself off)\n* Enable HDMI CEC Support\n* Maximum Game Resolution (Default, highest, exact to my monitor, etc.)\n* Reboot via \\[Quick Access\\] + \\[Vol -\\] + \\[Power\\] to reset the graphics APU/driver\n* Restarting the Deck with the Dock unplugged, then plugging it in before it powers back up (also Restarting with the Dock plugged in)\n* Unplugging/replugging/testing all display & power connections at various points in the docking cycle\n\nIt inexplicably works about 30% of the time, and rarely twice in a row despite not changing any settings between consecutive boots.\n\nWhen I run into HDMI trouble, the Deck's screen stays on and no feed gets to the monitor. But when I run into DisplayPort trouble, both the Deck's screen **and** my monitor go black, forcing me to use Steam Link on my phone to navigate to additional Display settings that only appear when Docked.\n\nI'm hoping that the biggest hurdle is simply my stupidity or blindness and that someone can point me in a very obvious direction to the solution, but I'm thinking that the sheer variety of monitor models is to blame for the difficulty in getting a reliable docked experience (especially on Ultrawide).\n\nHelp me, r/SteamDeck, you're my only hope.",

    "selftext": "Just a few days ago without warning my OLEDs battery decided to not hold charge anymore, it would die as soon as I unplugged it. I did some research and found out that people were having it repaired under warranty, I bought my Steamdeck several years ago and wasn't sure that I even had a warranty left. I decided that I would repair it myself since it might be faster than trying to send it back to Valve. I bought a replacement battery and spent some stressful minutes trying to remove the dead battery. After removing it I gently installed my new battery and brought my deck to the charger and was relived to see %1 battery life. I am not used to repairing expensive electronics myself and am so happy that I am holding a charge again. The picture below is the kit that I used for anyone needing to do this repair in the future. Happy gaming.",

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home. Rpi cannot be hidden well due to fairly weak wifi reception\n\nThanks guys! ",

The issue I am seeing with this is that the this will only work as long as my phone is within range of the lighbulbs. I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.",

    "title": "New lighting setup questions",
    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I am a bit tech challenged and I spent the last several years kinda nervous about Alexas and similar devices (It doesn't have to be Alexa specifically but I'm kinda like the gma that calls all video games Nintendo regardless of what console it is, even though I'm only 35.) but I was nervous before because I'd heard about them getting hacked and stuff like that. And I do still want to be safety minded for any risks there might be for things like that. But I'm also going through a lot of big life changes right now that having a little help from an at home assistant type device would be super helpful where I can just tell it a thing and it will remind me or add it to other devices and stuff like that. I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'd be tearing my hair out if I had any left.  Thank you in advance.",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "title": "Turn ESP32 devices into through-wall motion sensors",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nWinter is coming and mornings are getting darker every day and they will be in my neck of woods for the next 4-monhts. I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess. \n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!",

The issue I am seeing with this is that the this will only work as long as my phone is within range of the lighbulbs. I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

Thus, any occupancy sensor can turn on the stairwell lights and when all sensors have turned off the lights for the stairwell turn off. However, I'd like this to be on a scheduled routine whereby at night time the lights either come on or preferably come on very dimly. Would anyone have any suggestions on products that might achieve this? If need be I would certainly set up a Home Assistant server to accommodate this project. I set up a home assistant server a few years ago but couldn't quite justify keeping it in place as I didn't have the need at the time. But this would push me over this threshold should it be necessary. Thanks for your guidance!\n\nPs this would also work great in a residential bathroom: occupancy sensors and bathrooms are great except when it's the middle of the night!",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4).

Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2).

The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home. Rpi cannot be hidden well due to fairly weak wifi reception\n\nThanks guys! ",

    "selftext": "So I have replaced my outdoor porch and driveway lights with Govee smart lights and currently have them set up to turn on with sunset and turn off with sunrise. The issue I am seeing with this is that the this will only work as long as my phone is within range of the lighbulbs. I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

I know you can get very expensive smart displays/switches that have 'moods' and 'scene etc on it, but I want something budget friendly that I can program. Would be open to using NFC too.. or other work arounds. But something not involving an extra 'tag' would be ideal if possible.\n\nCan it be done with standard smart switches?",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

I’ve got the basics covered so far: a dishwasher, robot vacuum for cleaning, AC and central ventilation, a smart lock and cameras for security, plus whole-house lighting control and electric curtains.\n\nNow I’m thinking of adding something a bit different next, maybe for the shower room or the room that opens onto the balcony. I’ve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it’s on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI’m also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I’m leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven’t found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you’ve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I’d love to hear what worked for you.

I’m not a complete noob as I’m pretty tech savvy, but here, I’m really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I’m not here and I didn’t plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it’s only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can’t connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I’ve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn’t change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically… but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn’t detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I’m missing ? A secret step ?",

    "title": "Smart home Setup - internet issues",
    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "title": "Dark Apartment - need ideas / solutions",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

I would use a combo of IFTT or google home automation, I think but I also stumbled across Home Assistant and this seems super appealing. My question is what Hub has the most connectivity options to make sure I can get as many things talking as possible.\n\nThe options I can see that would work are\n\nAqara M3 - Seems like a solid all round option with matterr and Zigbee support\n\nAqara s1+ - this seems to require the M3 hub for matter support but also looks super clean and seems to support HA\n\nHome assistant Green - Not to sure on this but it seems to be an Rpi that works as a hub?\n\n,",

    "title": "Zombie Nest Camera",
    "selftext": "There must be a way to fix this. I just replaced a years old Nest Hello (wired) doorbell camera with a new Nest wired 3rd Gen doorbell.  The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

Is it possible to use any of these devices to automate the power-on process? Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. ",

Thank you all so much, I really appreciate this community so much. \n\n\n\nHi all, thank you in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\n**Prior to our issues:** we have a Google Home and multiple brands/types of smart devices. All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

Now, Google wants nearly £300 for renewal  and it’s being rebranded as Google Home Premium Advanced.\n\nThat price jump feels insane for what I’m getting.\n\nI’ve recently moved all my automations to Home Assistant and absolutely love it. It’s made me realize how much control I could have outside Google’s ecosystem.\n\nSo, my question:\nWhat’s the best way to move away from Google/Nest entirely while keeping similar functionality (especially for cameras and hubs)?\n\nIs there a good local/NAS-based alternative for video storage and smart home integration?\n\nAnyone here migrated from Nest to Home Assistant-compatible cameras successfully?\n\nAnd what’s the best use for the Nest Hubs if I start de-Googling everything?\n\n\nAppreciate any tips or migration stories from folks who’ve done this , I’m happy to tinker, but I don’t want to lose reliability or ease of use for the family.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

I’ve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it’s on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI’m also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I’m leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven’t found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you’ve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I’d love to hear what worked for you. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nWinter is coming and mornings are getting darker every day and they will be in my neck of woods for the next 4-monhts. I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

Great. But I still can’t connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I’ve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn’t change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically… but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn’t detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I’m missing ? A secret step ?",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - seeking wired zwave, zigbee or WiFi motion and/or presence sensors. The next requirement is that they have programmable sensitivity and trigger time. \n\nThanks!\n\n————-\n\n\nI’m tired of batteries. I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I’m ready to just go wired where I can. It’s inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it’s hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is … no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

    "selftext": "There must be a way to fix this. I just replaced a years old Nest Hello (wired) doorbell camera with a new Nest wired 3rd Gen doorbell.  The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

I’ve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it’s on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI’m also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I’m leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven’t found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you’ve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I’d love to hear what worked for you.

To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

    "selftext": "I was wondering if there are smart light switches / devices that you can program to also change the colour/brightness of the lights (I mostly have Tuya smart bulbs, they work with HomeKit, tuya, google assistant and smartlife)? I was thinking something simple rather than lots of buttons, ideally like if you double tap or triple tap a button it loads one of your lighting presets.  I know you can get very expensive smart displays/switches that have 'moods' and 'scene etc on it, but I want something budget friendly that I can program. Would be open to using NFC too.. or other work arounds. But something not involving an extra 'tag' would be ideal if possible.\n\nCan it be done with standard smart switches?",

And Im doing first time any \"smart\" setup\n\nRight now, I have **nothing except regular EU wall outlets** — no smart lamps, no smart bulbs, no plugs.  \nMy goal is to have a few **floor or table lamps** around the apartment that I can **control from my phone**, ideally with the ability to **change the light color (RGB or warm/cool white)** and turn them on/off individually or all at once.\n\nSince I’m renting, I **can’t do any physical modifications** to the apartment (no rewiring or replacing wall switches).\n\nSo I’m not sure what’s the best way to achieve this:\n\n* Should I buy **smart plugs** and connect regular lamps to them with regular lightbulbs?\n* Or should I go for **smart bulbs** (that can change color) and use them in normal lamps?\n* Or maybe get **smart lamps** that already have everything built in?\n* Would a **mix of these** make sense?\n\nI’d love to know what setup would be the easiest and most flexible for my case — ideally something I can control via phone.  \nAlso, what **brands** of smart bulbs/plugs/lamps would you recommend for the **EU market** that are reliable and easy to use? (Preferably I can get them on amazon de)\n\nBasically, I want a simple, renter-friendly setup that lets me control and customize lighting around the apartment without touching any wiring, that I can latter move them to other place and that they are scalable and what I mean by that is that I can latter expand my smarthome and connect other stuff to it\n\nAny advice or personal experience would be super helpful!\n\nThanks in advance ",

I’m not a complete noob as I’m pretty tech savvy, but here, I’m really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I’m not here and I didn’t plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it’s only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can’t connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I’ve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn’t change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically… but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn’t detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I’m missing ? A secret step ?",

The problem is that of course, the sensor doesn't pick up the motion until you turn the corner.\n\nI'm looking for a solution that:\n\n1) detects motion from either end\n2) allows for manual operation\n3) is smart enough that if I turn off the light, the motion sensor doesn't immediately turn it back on. The single Maestro switch has that feature. \n\nI have Lutron Caseta switches + hub elsewhere in the house, so bonus if it all works together. OTOH, I don't think I need to control these lights from an app. \n\nI saw there is a Lutron motion sensor (PD-OSENS-WH) that pairs with a Caseta kind of like a Pico remote. I was thinking of mounting that in the corner of the L, but I think that violates #3 since it has no knowledge of the light was manually operated from the Caseta.\n\nCan someone suggest some options?

The next requirement is that they have programmable sensitivity and trigger time. \n\nThanks!\n\n————-\n\n\nI’m tired of batteries. I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I’m ready to just go wired where I can. It’s inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it’s hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is … no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

I am a total noob and can't even use basic commands on linux, but for some reason my eyes have been fixed for POP OS and I really wanna use it and learn Linux with POP os and nothing else. I have installed Ubuntu, Mint, Zorin OS, etc without any problem with dual booting just to try it out, no other OS have had this problem. Thanks! \n\nEdit: My problem is with the fact that even after both installations are safely done on separate drives. I can't successfully get the boot manager to detect both installations and give me options at boot, despite trying everything like copying the Windows EFI file to the POP's efi folder etc. I don't like having to smash F12 when I want to choose OS at boot.

There wasn't anything similar problem, just motherboard or ram faulty and being replaced with a new one (from HP service center under warranty itself). It's been around a week or two since I've got this back... I tested the sound, and it was working when I got it. (Now I'm not sure since when the sound was gone... I usually use earphones and keep the pc on mute).\n\nLaptop: HP Pavilion 14 Laptop PC 14-dv2000\n\nWindows version: Version 25H2 (OS Build 26200.6901) (Windows 11 Home)\n\n  \n**What's happening:**\n\nThe speaker device is showing up. When I try manually increasing the sound from \"sound settings\" in settings, there's that visualizer thingy which shows up with windows sound when we increase volume with lever but no sound. ([Check here - image showing](https://ibb.co/C5zxtHp5))\n\nNote: That sound is audible on my earphones (Bluetooth ones).\n\n  \nAnd I tried \"uninstalling - no remove\" the drivers from device manager from under \"Audio inputs and outputs\" and \"Sound, Video and game controllers\" - Namely driver \"**Realtek(R) audio**\". And rebooted, to see it back with no fix.\n\nThen I even uninstalled (and removed) all of them, installed the drivers from HP support and drivers site using my device service code... but no fix. It's square back to it.\n\n\n\nThings I've done:\n\n1. Uninstalled (no remove) drivers and reboot. ✅ **No fix**.\n\n2. Checked sound/volume was at 100%. ✅\n\n3. Checked the speaker as the output device. ✅\n\n4. Removed the driver, downloaded and installed the drivers from HP driver site, and rebooted. ✅ No fix.\n\n5. Used get help, troubleshoot. ✅ No fix.\n\n6. Force-restarted (Held power-button for 5 secs. After the pc closed, held it for 15 seconds... and when it started/booted, did shutdown without logging in and left it for around 30 minutes with nothing plugged and all). \n\n7. Did \"restart\" and \"shutdown\" the PC, separately. \n\n  \nNote: Please help, I've been trying all that fix... from various reddit posts and ChatGPT helps but couldn't fix it. And sorry if it isn't too nuanced or any poor wording/grammars. \n\n  \nThanks to anyone who can help me with this issue :)",

I have a 4TB Seagate portable hard drive that I put my physical movies and shows that I rip and convert to digital to watch on my tv. It is formatted in exFAT format.\n\nStarting a few days ago, anything new that I put on the drive doesn't show up if I put it in a newly created folder. For example, I created a folder for a show, put all the files onto it, and then put it on the drive. The folder shows up on the drive, but when you click it, it says no contents found. The folder also says created 12/31/1969 too for some reason. Now, if I remove those files and put them in a previously existing folder on my drive, the files will show up no problem.\n\nI even tried putting the files on a separate and different USB drive to see if it was the files, but it wasn't. Everything shows up perfectly fine in their newly created folders on any new drive I use. Only on my Seagate will they not show up in their given folders and only if I remove them and put them into a previously created one. Does anyone know what may be causing this and how to fix it? It's puzzling me.",

    "selftext": "Hello lads, I have recently been encountering an issue with my ram consumption, atm I have 16gb.  \nSystem starts at 30% ram for a while it's fine and then it starts growing over the next several minutes.\n\nI have used a software called MemReduct to check and clear my memory, a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/qriMKVc) from it shows it nearing max consumption, after a while of that the system gets slow, locks up and crashes. When I clean memory, the pagefile continues rising, even though the physical memory is temporarily back down to 50% or so.\n\nI have not been able to identify a culprit through task manager, there seem to be a lot of Service Host processes taking up between 0.5-10mb though, not sure if that's normal.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/znXxvg3](https://imgur.com/a/znXxvg3) [https://imgur.com/a/dRDgIAj](https://imgur.com/a/dRDgIAj)\n\nAnother thing I have been noticing is that whenever I power off or restart my computer, it sits on the blackscreen for indefinite lengths of time, and I end up having to force restart.\n\nIf anybody has ideas as to how to diagnose this, fix or get rid of it, I would be greatly thankful, I am open to providing more information, in hopes of solving this issue",

I've tried going into BIOS to activate and deactivate Secure Boot, tried installing Windows on another SSD, all to the same result.\n\nMy only assumption is that somehow when I formatted the disks and created new partitions, it made the disks back into MBR, and now it's like Secure Boot is off so I can't get into Windows? Any idea what this might be?\n\nUpdate: The bootloop begins after the initial 100% process is done. I pick the Windows 11 volume for the installation, a new progress bar on a black screen pops up, loads to 33%, then restarts and the bootloop starts.",

It stays black even if I press the power button. I can still feel vibrations, so it seems the phone is on, just the display doesn’t turn on.\n\nI feel like the phone is lagging behind the scenes for some reason, because ocasionally, after it finally wakes up, I get a “System Launcer isn’t responding” or \"Whatsapp isn't responding\" message.\n  \nThis might be unrelated, but this issue started earlier today when my phone suddenly got very hot in my pocket, and when I checked, some kind of “Find My Phone” app or service was open (I forgot exactly which one). \n\nSince then, the phone has been hot for the whole day. I checked the Find Device feature from Xiaomi is off, and only Find Hub from Google is enabled which has been enabled before this issue happens.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n* Restarted the phone\n* Cleared cache and data for System Launcher\n* Turned off Location Services\n* Optimized apps that has high power consumption\n* Checked last location access (only Google and Weather have full location access while in background)\n\nIf I’m not charging, the display always wakes normally.\n\nNote: System Launcher last updated in 27/10 and issue is happening today at 29/10\n\nHas anyone experienced this or know how to fix it?",

    "selftext": "# What’s happening\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI’m hoping someone can help me figure this one out because I’m completely lost with what to do next. My internet is extremely slow at times. However, it also works completely fine at times with no issues other than occasionally disconnecting and then reconnecting. I have run tests on both my desktop, which is having problems, and my laptop, which is working fine, and both list speeds up to 70.8Mbps download and 14.0Mbps upload on 'Internet speed test', which says it is \"Very Fast\".\n\nOn top of this, sometimes it doesn't even connect me to the internet at all, which seems to happen randomly. When running the Windows Internet Troubleshooter, it says one of five things depending on the day: \n\n1. No DHCP server was found. The network connection quality might be low.\n2. Can't reach default gateway\n3. No IP address was assigned automatically. The network connection quality might be low.\n4. You're connected to the internet. The network connection quality might be low (This is the most common message and is displayed when the internet works, but is slow)\n5. You're connected to the internet. We didn't find any problems with your network. (This is displayed when it works)\n\nNot sure if it is important, but I will list everything: When the internet works and occasionally **cuts out,** when it reconnects, it goes from **\"unauthorised internet\"** to **\"Identifying\"** and finally **\"connected\"** again, as shown in the bottom right internet Windows tray.\n\nI am using a **wired (Ethernet)** connection on my desktop as my desktop doesn't have a wifi card. I have also tested the wifi using my laptop, which works completely fine. Not only this, but my household has other desktops which have seen 0 connection issues.\n\n\n\n# Troubleshooting I’ve done so far\n\n* Restarted PC\n* Restarted my modem/router\n* Checked Ethernet cables and replaced them\n* Ran Windows Network Troubleshooter\n* Uninstalled and reinstalled the network adapter driver (Realtek Gaming 2.5GbE Family Controller) to the latest version, which is as recent as 2025\n* Full Network Reset\n* Ran full network command reset via Command Prompt on administrator with the commands in order:\n\n1. netsh winsock reset\n2. netsh int ip reset\n3. ipconfig /release\n4. ipconfig /renew\n5. ipconfig /flushdns\n\nThe problem is interesting because it **doesn't work** at all one minute, **works slowly** another and then works **completely fine** the next. It is clear I should be getting better speeds as other devices, such as other desktops, laptops and phones, are all working fine.  \n  \nAny help is more than appreciated. I feel I have tried everything and don't know where to even go from here. Any questions or suggestions at all, please do comment, and I will happily do my best to answer or test whatever is needed to help identify and solve the issue.\n\nWhat should I do next? \n\nWhat do you think it could be?\n\nThanks for any help! :)",

I have no idea on how to fix this, I had this same issue with a headset that was aux so I returned and got a usb headset to see if it would fix the problem and it did but it when back to the same issues. If anyone knows what I’m dealing with or even has an idea I would love to hear it cause I tried looking to see if anyone else has this problem and while I found some things like people saying update the driver of the headset the headset drivers were already updated so if anyone has any suggestions I’m all ears.",

    "selftext": "Almost a month ago, I had a hardware issue with my laptop: one of the hinges popped out, and the screen cracked when I tried to fix it.  So I ended up sending it out to the Costco Service Center as I was still under warranty, and they fixed the issue.  But they had to do a factory reset in the process, which wasn't a big deal since I had my apps, photos, and stuff saved across various accounts and in the cloud.  The trouble started a little after I connected to the Wi-Fi.  It was working normally at first, but as I was downloading my stuff back, the internet went out.  It was still connected, but it kept saying no internet.  I tried everything I could: I restarted, forgot the Wi-Fi, then connected it back, reset the network adapter, went through the command prompt, restored the default settings on the network and sharing settings, turned off the firewall on McAfee and the VPN, but nothing seems to work, as it still says no internet.  I have an HP x360 laptop with Windows 11, so any advice would be appreciated.\n\n  \nAlso, I can use my phone's Mobile Hotspot on the laptop using the same Wi-Fi signal, but I can't connect the laptop itself to the Wi-Fi with internet access.

It is connected via DP to my PC, and I have a second monitor (also acer but a different model and not the problem monitor) that is connected to my PC via HDMI.\n\nWhen I turn off my PC, I also turn off both my monitors because their indicator lights are annoying when trying to sleep. When I go to use my PC I turn the monitors on first and then turn on the PC. However, despite being on, the ED240Q monitor will not detect. The other acer does, which is annoying because it is my second (i.e., not main) monitor). The only solution I have found is, before turning on the PC, I unplug the ED240Q monitor from the wall and plug it back in. Only this method will allow it to detect the PC when I turn the PC on. It's annoying to have to do that though.\n\nAny ideas as to what is going on?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hi — I own a Moto G45 and I suddenly forgot my pattern. I tried a few times and now the phone forces a 480-second wait after each wrong attempt. The phone still has fingerprint and face unlock set up, but I can’t get them to work because of the lock screen. I have important and sensitive data on the device that I can’t afford to lose. Is there a safe/legal way to regain access without a factory reset (or to boot into Safe Mode so I can use biometrics and change the lock)? Android version: (e.g. Android 14), Carrier/region: (e.g. unlocked/India). I’m the device owner — please only suggest legitimate solutions. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "So, i recently moved house and in doing so had to switch from ethernet to a wi-fi connection, but i didn’t have a little wi-fi usb card thingy (not really sure what they’re called). I ordered a cheap one off amazon and it came the next day. plugged it in, came up as a flash drive which surprised me a bit, installed the drivers, and bang i had internet! it was actually a very speedy connection and much better than the ethernet connection i had in my old house. It worked great for the whole of last night, no issues. This morning, i booted up my computer and called some friends. everything was okay for about 5 minutes and suddenly my friend was speaking and his word just like repeated over and over again, with my comptuter just frozen. he was basically just repeating the word “and” or something for like 10 seconds and then it shut off. i restarted it and got this error message: “couldn’t connect to network, keep your device on and we’ll look for a solution in 30 minutes.” I decided to shut off of my pc at the plug and unplug this usb wi-fi card. after rebooting, my pc opened okay. i plugged in the wi-fi card and got back on the call with my friends, only for the exact same thing to happen. computer froze, friends mic bugged out, but this time, it said something along the lines of “somethings gone wrong, your computer will restart “ and then my computer just immediately restarted. im now kind of just sat here on my desktop not knowing what to do. im not sure if this is to do with the sketchy wifi card or anything. i have ran multiple malware scans and found nothing. anyone know what to do?",

Unfortunately I got a crash last week on my primary nVME disk and had reinstall the whole system.

I replaced the thermal paste and used it until early July. I mainly played CS2 at a stable 144 FPS with absolutely no problems, and Battlefield 1 with FPS locked at 60.\n\nThen the laptop lay unused for about 3 months. Now in October, when I started gaming again, the FPS will suddenly drop drastically to around 15 for a few seconds, and then go back up to 144. This never happened before.\n\nI thought it might be the thermal paste, but I replaced it not long ago (April). I still opened the laptop again and reapplied the paste (I put a small dot on the VRAM chips because I didn’t have thermal pads).\n\nDoes anyone know what could be causing this?  \nI reinstalled all GPU drivers, changed performance modes in Armory Crate, tried G-Helper - nothing helped. I’m also considering reinstalling Windows, but since I don’t run any illegal or suspicious software, I’m not sure if it would make any difference.\n\nI would appreciate any advice!",

I deleted TPM from Drive C, rebooted, disabled TPM in the bios, and then it let me decrypt. So now I'm dual-booting. Did I mention I use Arch, btw?\n\n  \n**If someone could explain why it kept re-encrypting, that'd help my brain understand what I did, because I tried many, many things. Registry key didn't work for disabling encryption. Seems to have to do with TPM.**\n\nQuestion is pretty much in the title. I don't want to keep toggling between secureboot on/off to boot Linux. I use Arch and don't feel like going through the major ball ache of signing it so Secureboot works, especially because I'd have to do it each time I update the kernel. Which I do often. I do not have a good reason for this...\n\nCurrent setup is Windows 11 with secureboot/bitlocker. Wondering if I could just Clonezilla the whole thing and restore it when I return the laptop. I don't think it should create an issue, but I'm wondering if bitlocker might have a hissy fit. I can disable secureboot and do a live image, which I've loaded from an NVME usb drive. I guess I could also set the drive up to allow updates. Meh. Weirdly, toggling secureboot off then on again wiped the pin I use to login but nothing else.\n\nObligatory \"I use Arch btw\"",

    "selftext": "Hello, I have had this laptop (HP Pavilion 14 Laptop PC 14-dv2000) since a year now. There wasn't anything similar problem, just motherboard or ram faulty and being replaced with a new one (from HP service center under warranty itself). It's been around a week or two since I've got this back... I tested the sound, and it was working when I got it. (Now I'm not sure since when the sound was gone... I usually use earphones and keep the pc on mute).\n\nLaptop: HP Pavilion 14 Laptop PC 14-dv2000\n\nWindows version: Version 25H2 (OS Build 26200.6901) (Windows 11 Home)\n\n  \n**What's happening:**\n\nThe speaker device is showing up. When I try manually increasing the sound from \"sound settings\" in settings, there's that visualizer thingy which shows up with windows sound when we increase volume with lever but no sound. ([Check here - image showing](https://ibb.co/C5zxtHp5))\n\nNote: That sound is audible on my earphones (Bluetooth ones).\n\n  \nAnd I tried \"uninstalling - no remove\" the drivers from device manager from under \"Audio inputs and outputs\" and \"Sound, Video and game controllers\" - Namely driver \"**Realtek(R) audio**\". And rebooted, to see it back with no fix.\n\nThen I even uninstalled (and removed) all of them, installed the drivers from HP support and drivers site using my device service code... but no fix. It's square back to it.\n\n\n\nThings I've done:\n\n1. Uninstalled (no remove) drivers and reboot. ✅ **No fix**.\n\n2. Checked sound/volume was at 100%. ✅\n\n3. Checked the speaker as the output device. ✅\n\n4. Removed the driver, downloaded and installed the drivers from HP driver site, and rebooted. ✅ No fix.\n\n5. Used get help, troubleshoot. ✅ No fix.\n\n6. Force-restarted (Held power-button for 5 secs. After the pc closed, held it for 15 seconds... and when it started/booted, did shutdown without logging in and left it for around 30 minutes with nothing plugged and all). \n\n7. Did \"restart\" and \"shutdown\" the PC, separately. \n\n  \nNote: Please help, I've been trying all that fix... from various reddit posts and ChatGPT helps but couldn't fix it. And sorry if it isn't too nuanced or any poor wording/grammars. \n\n  \nThanks to anyone who can help me with this issue :)",

The last thing I said only happend once, but now I'm even more worried about everything. Any clue in what the sound (or the tab thingy that happened once) could be?",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I made a reddit account just for this post because something a month ago occurred to me but now im wondering if it meant anything.  On Septermber 7, 2025, my pc (which ive had for about 3 years now) started acting up and becoming super slow. I decided to shut down my pc and restart it hoping maybe that would fix it, (since my pc is on the older side and it acts up sometimes). I then assumed that this mightve been malware, so I ran my files through the built in windows malware detector to see if anything was suspicious, but nothing came up. I decided to shut down my pc again because my pc was still acting slow, and the process of opening anything at all was super laggy. However, on my second attempt, something extremely weird came up. All of sudden, my apps all went missing, and my wallpaper was completely black. A weird message on the bottom of my pc read “Something is watching you” this occured at 2:43PM, and to be honest, i wasnt too scared because i assumed it to be just malware, or maybe this is farfetched, but i do use wallpaper engine, and maybe the person who made my wallpaper put some sort of code or whatever that could do that when i start up my pc, i dont know much to be honest. I took a screenshot and i also told my family, but after a minute or so my pc went completely back to normal and everything went back to being smooth. I threw away my webcam after that. As of now, my pc is still normal and i have never gotten that pop up again; there has also been no sign of malware. I also tried searching this up online but nothing similar came up. If you guys know anything about this please let me know! Im just a little curious but i hope this doesnt lead to anything harmful.\n\nId like to mention that my pc also does this thing where it turns on and off by it self in the middle of the night when i set it to sleep. I just assumed that it was because my mouse was super sensitive and the \"wind was setting it off\" but im not sure anymore..\n\nIf you guys would like to see a screenshot i also posted this to r/pchelphub\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PCHelpHub/s/qeHaKjoV1H",

I am a total noob and can't even use basic commands on linux, but for some reason my eyes have been fixed for POP OS and I really wanna use it and learn Linux with POP os and nothing else. I have installed Ubuntu, Mint, Zorin OS, etc without any problem with dual booting just to try it out, no other OS have had this problem. Thanks! \n\nEdit: My problem is with the fact that even after both installations are safely done on separate drives. I can't successfully get the boot manager to detect both installations and give me options at boot, despite trying everything like copying the Windows EFI file to the POP's efi folder etc. I don't like having to smash F12 when I want to choose OS at boot.

I've had it on a working charger for the past hour, but I don't see any charging lights (to be fair, I have no idea if it has any).\n\nThe screen was working and there was power before the forced power-off so I guess it's a software problem.

I have a 4TB Seagate portable hard drive that I put my physical movies and shows that I rip and convert to digital to watch on my tv. It is formatted in exFAT format.\n\nStarting a few days ago, anything new that I put on the drive doesn't show up if I put it in a newly created folder. For example, I created a folder for a show, put all the files onto it, and then put it on the drive. The folder shows up on the drive, but when you click it, it says no contents found. The folder also says created 12/31/1969 too for some reason. Now, if I remove those files and put them in a previously existing folder on my drive, the files will show up no problem.\n\nI even tried putting the files on a separate and different USB drive to see if it was the files, but it wasn't. Everything shows up perfectly fine in their newly created folders on any new drive I use. Only on my Seagate will they not show up in their given folders and only if I remove them and put them into a previously created one. Does anyone know what may be causing this and how to fix it?

When I try manually increasing the sound from \"sound settings\" in settings, there's that visualizer thingy which shows up with windows sound when we increase volume with lever but no sound. ([Check here - image showing](https://ibb.co/C5zxtHp5))\n\nNote: That sound is audible on my earphones (Bluetooth ones).\n\n  \nAnd I tried \"uninstalling - no remove\" the drivers from device manager from under \"Audio inputs and outputs\" and \"Sound, Video and game controllers\" - Namely driver \"**Realtek(R) audio**\". And rebooted, to see it back with no fix.\n\nThen I even uninstalled (and removed) all of them, installed the drivers from HP support and drivers site using my device service code... but no fix. It's square back to it.\n\n\n\nThings I've done:\n\n1. Uninstalled (no remove) drivers and reboot. ✅ **No fix**.\n\n2. Checked sound/volume was at 100%. ✅\n\n3. Checked the speaker as the output device. ✅\n\n4. Removed the driver, downloaded and installed the drivers from HP driver site, and rebooted. ✅ No fix.\n\n5. Used get help, troubleshoot. ✅ No fix.\n\n6. Force-restarted (Held power-button for 5 secs. After the pc closed, held it for 15 seconds... and when it started/booted, did shutdown without logging in and left it for around 30 minutes with nothing plugged and all). \n\n7. Did \"restart\" and \"shutdown\" the PC, separately. \n\n  \nNote: Please help, I've been trying all that fix... from various reddit posts and ChatGPT helps but couldn't fix it. And sorry if it isn't too nuanced or any poor wording/grammars. \n\n  \nThanks to anyone who can help me with this issue :)",

On Septermber 7, 2025, my pc (which ive had for about 3 years now) started acting up and becoming super slow. I decided to shut down my pc and restart it hoping maybe that would fix it, (since my pc is on the older side and it acts up sometimes). I then assumed that this mightve been malware, so I ran my files through the built in windows malware detector to see if anything was suspicious, but nothing came up. I decided to shut down my pc again because my pc was still acting slow, and the process of opening anything at all was super laggy. However, on my second attempt, something extremely weird came up. All of sudden, my apps all went missing, and my wallpaper was completely black. A weird message on the bottom of my pc read “Something is watching you” this occured at 2:43PM, and to be honest, i wasnt too scared because i assumed it to be just malware, or maybe this is farfetched, but i do use wallpaper engine, and maybe the person who made my wallpaper put some sort of code or whatever that could do that when i start up my pc, i dont know much to be honest. I took a screenshot and i also told my family, but after a minute or so my pc went completely back to normal and everything went back to being smooth. I threw away my webcam after that. As of now, my pc is still normal and i have never gotten that pop up again; there has also been no sign of malware. I also tried searching this up online but nothing similar came up. If you guys know anything about this please let me know! Im just a little curious but i hope this doesnt lead to anything harmful.\n\nId like to mention that my pc also does this thing where it turns on and off by it self in the middle of the night when i set it to sleep. I just assumed that it was because my mouse was super sensitive and the \"wind was setting it off\" but im not sure anymore..\n\nIf you guys would like to see a screenshot i also posted this to r/pchelphub\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PCHelpHub/s/qeHaKjoV1H",

I've been handing out business cards with his likeness on them, and a link to his Wikipedia page, but I've been doing this for over a year and have nothing to show for it.\n\nI'm looking for a good pair of camera spyglasses for purchase:\n\nClarifying before we continue: I went to /gadgets and /tech to make a request, but it seems those places are for advertising and not for product searches.\n\nI'm looking for a pair of sunglasses. Fashionable, polarized (dark) lenses, brown frames, with the ability to record video and will take a removeable micro SD card. For anyone curious, no, I am *not* streaming video; consent is pretty important to this cause, so anyone in these videos will *not* have their likeness or voice shared anywhere.\n\nI have a pair of polarized sunglasses on order from Amazon, and will report back about their usefulness, but will likely not be keeping them if I can find a more attractive pair elsewhere at a similar price point.\n\n\\*If you're interested in the cause I'm supporting, you can read about this fine individual here:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold\\_Pilecki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold_Pilecki)",

    "selftext": "I have been trying to dual boot POP OS with windows 11 for a while now and everytime I try, I have been unsuccessful. I have tried following tutorials on YouTube and websites but most of them do it on the same SSD and don't encounter any problems. Those who do it on different SSDs tutorials are confusing and I haven't been able to follow them.\n\nSomebody please help me. I am a total noob and can't even use basic commands on linux, but for some reason my eyes have been fixed for POP OS and I really wanna use it and learn Linux with POP os and nothing else. I have installed Ubuntu, Mint, Zorin OS, etc without any problem with dual booting just to try it out, no other OS have had this problem. Thanks! \n\nEdit: My problem is with the fact that even after both installations are safely done on separate drives. I can't successfully get the boot manager to detect both installations and give me options at boot, despite trying everything like copying the Windows EFI file to the POP's efi folder etc. I don't like having to smash F12 when I want to choose OS at boot. Sorry if I didn't communicate my problem well.",
