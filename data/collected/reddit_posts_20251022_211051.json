First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’d like to share the app I’ve been working on over the past few months - **Dory**.\n\nI think the video does a much better job of explaining what it’s all about, so feel free to check it out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z\\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z_Q)\n\n**Dory is an app switcher that lets you quickly cycle through apps without moving your hand from the mouse, keyboard or trackpad - and without needing to remember any shortcuts.**\n\nClick a mouse button - or a modifier key if both hands are on the keyboard - and type the first letter of the app’s name.\n\nFind apps using the first letter, middle letters, acronyms, or similar names.\n\nIf multiple apps share that letter, just keep tapping it to cycle through them.\n\nYou can also press the middle mouse button and start typing the app’s name directly.\n\nPrefer tapping over holding? No problem. With Press Mode, you can open Dory’s sleek UI using a global shortcut or a **trackpad gesture!** (new)\n\nDory works right out of the box - and over time, it learns which apps you use most and prioritizes them.\n\nNo extra shortcuts.\n\nNo setup. Nothing to remember.\n\n\\--\n\nIt's currently $4.99 on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dory-app-switcher/id6746273626?mt=12) (**One-time purchase**. **No subscription.**) for a limited time.",

    "selftext": "* **Touch-Screen MacBook Pro Incoming:** Apple is preparing to launch a touch-screen MacBook Pro, reversing its long-standing stance against touch interfaces on Macs.\n* **Release Timeline:** Expected in late 2026 or early 2027.\n* **Key Features:**\n   * OLED display technology (first time in a Mac).\n   * Hole-punch camera design replacing the notch.\n   * Thinner, lighter frames.\n   * Reinforced hinge to improve touch stability.\n   * M6 chip line.\n* **User Experience:** Will retain full keyboard and trackpad, allowing users to choose between touch and traditional input.\n* **Pricing:** Likely to be several hundred dollars more than current models due to premium components.\n* **Strategic Shift:** Apple is testing market response before expanding touch to other Mac models.\n* **Historical Context:** This marks a major shift from Steve Jobs’ and Tim Cook’s earlier criticisms of touch-screen laptops.",

In our dataset, it had a spike to almost 40% in the middle of September, but came back a bit after that.\n\nCompare to macOS 15 which exactly one year ago had 50% of the market share. \n\nObviously, it is just a subset. But the drop from 40 to 30% is pretty significant even for that subset. (Based on https://telemetrydeck.com/platforms/swift/ - 6,280 apps use it, but that includes macOS and iOS apps)\n\nPS. I am a macOS indie app developer, but I personally do not use TelemetryDeck and I am not in any way related to them. Just found this data being really interesting, so decided to share.  ",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "selftext": "There’s been this talk about fully closing apps vs leaving them in memory. For the most part people are very divided on this topic. I’ve heard that when you fully close an app it uses more processing power to start it over than to pull it from RAM, impacting battery. Others say its better to close them. Theres a 3rd group of people that say it makes literally no difference.\n\nMe personally i have a habit of closing all my open apps every time im about to lock my phone, its like muscle memory. Sometimes i close and open instagram like 5-10 times in 5 minutes… 😆\n\nI’d like to hear your opinions in the topic and how you guys use your phones. ",

The screen and animations felt a bit weird like it had a lower refresh rate or a bit of lag. opening apps or pulling down control center felt kind of off, almost like my finger wasn’t responding right.\n\nIt was a demo phone but it's new. I've been an Android user my whole life and it was literally the first iphone I have ever touched!\n\nWas that just my imagination, or is there a reason iPhones sometimes feel like that when you first use them?\n\nHas anyone else had the same feeling trying an iPhone for the first time? 🤔",

    "selftext": "My main fury (amongst many others) with iPhone (that I’ve never ever had with any other phones) is that for some reason, I don’t know if it’s because of the visual layout and quietness of video taking that makes you totally miss it when you swear you’ve pressed it Or if it’s because it actually doesn’t detect you pushing the record button sometimes, is that very many times, I could’ve sworn I had pressed the record button on a very special or very rare once in a lifetime moment, think I’m recording the whole entire thing, then realize that after I press “stop” is when it STARTS recording hence I’ve missed capturing that entire Once in a lifetime or precious memory. This happens ALOT and only with my iPhone 13pro. Again, never ever had this happen with any of my other phones. iPhone has also, for some reason, stopped ringing its alarm when it’s supposed to keep going even after I set it to never stop , causing me to miss work at times and I’ve also never had this issue at all with any other non-iPhone, but the biggest fury for me is the video. It just happened to me this morning again and now I’m depressed and literally anxious and angry over it. Granted I haven’t been in the best mental space lately and in a bit of a mental rut, but even if I wasn’t, it still hurts and feels really bad whenever this happens. I’m not sure why it does with iPhone only in particular but has anyone else had this issue or is it just me ? :/",

    "selftext": "Apologies if this isn’t allowed but I need to rant as I’m on holiday and broke my foot two days ago and also have food poisoning and now I’ve just bent the chassis of my brand new iPhone 17 Pro Max which is just the cherry on top, and everyone else is asleep so I need someone to rant to.\n\nI like to have a big screen to watch things on and therefore have always gone for whatever the biggest iPhone available is. For me it was the 6s+, 11 Pro Max, 14 Pro Max, and as of 12 days ago the 17 Pro Max. The thing is, I have never used any of these phones with a case because I have small hands so struggle a lot more that most people with one-handed operation even without the added bulk of a case. I know there are some low profile ones so that may be a stupid philosophy but every millimetre helps.\n\nI’m very careful with all of my gadgets and generally don’t drop them but when you’re holding something in your hands for multiple hours a day and taking it in and out of your pockets multiple times a day, for several years, there will inevitably be a couple of drops. I’ve never had an issue with ANY of my previous iPhones besides some very superficial scuff marks on the outside, even when being dropped from chest height onto concrete. But today my 17 Pro Max was charging and got caught with another cable and fell about 3ft on to the tile floor.\n\nThe chassis is now bent and the bottom left corner has a noticeable lip when running your finger off the edge of the screen. Despite this being annoying, I am worried about what implications this may have for water resistance etc. Is there anything I can do? I have Apple Care + but not sure if they’d do anything about it.\n\nWhat pisses me off the most is that this is, as usual, supposedly their most Pro iPhone yet and a whole heap of their marketing involves showing how tough it is. They literally have a guy on a film set flying through an explosion with it. Yet, as I just found out, you can’t drop it a couple of feet off the bed. And like other people have found out, you can’t let the camera bump come in contact with basically anything or else the coating will come off of the corners. Oh and you can’t leave an orange one out in the sun or it will turn pink. Just like with their hugely bungled Apple Intelligence launch I feel like this is honestly entering the realms of false advertising.\n\nWith all of that in mind I was thinking I would probably end up getting a case for this one and then trade it in for an 18 Pro Max next year if they sort these issues out, but I’m on holiday now and having used caseless iPhones since the 6s Plus without any issues, I thought SURELY it can’t be so bad that it won’t last until I’m back. I was wrong.\n\nIt’s a shame because I used to be a big Apple fan but they really are torching the remaining good will I have for them.\n\nAnyway, is this something Apple Care + would cover or am I just out of luck here?",

Would you recommend that? What are things to consider? Would it leave any residue upon removal or effect the device by any means?\n\nI also have an esr cybertough case, would adding the skin effect the fitting of the case?\n",

I tried it with different c-type cables of other (android) devices, and the phone gets charged without any problem.

    "selftext": "Apparently the demand just isn’t there? This is a device with very real compromises (not a dig, just an objective statement) but I would’ve expected it to sell well enough overall. I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra. Now I wonder…",

Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "Apparently the demand just isn’t there? This is a device with very real compromises (not a dig, just an objective statement) but I would’ve expected it to sell well enough overall. I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra. Now I wonder…",

    "selftext": "After 6 loyal years with my OnePlus 7Pro, the device finally gave up on me. It had been flawless all these years, but one random afternoon — mid doomscroll — it decided to retire. No drama, no warning it just switched off like, “That’s enough internet for one lifetime.” Just gone. \n\nThe local repair folks declared it a “CPU and RAM issue” — tech-speak for “it’s gone, bro.” Meanwhile, OnePlus customer support gave me the final nail in the coffin: “Your device has reached end of life. We don’t have spare parts anymore.”\n\nTranslation: We’ve moved on. You should too.\n\nAnd that’s when I knew it was time.\nEnter: the iPhone 17 🍏\n\nHonestly, this felt like the most obvious upgrade for me. I’d been waiting for Apple to bring ProMotion to the base models ever since I first experienced that silky 90Hz refresh rate on my OnePlus — and now that it’s here, it feels so worth the wait. The same screen as the iPhone 17 Pro, the bump in base storage, and that trademark Apple refinement — it feels like the first time in years the baseline model doesn’t feel “less than.” It’s smooth, fast, and feels complete.\n\nAnd then… there’s the Sage Green. 💚🤑\nI didn’t think a colour could make me fall in love with a phone, but this shade did it. It’s calm, clean, and has that understated premium vibe — not shouting for attention, just quietly flexing in good lighting. Easily one of Apple’s best colour choices in a long time.\n\nThe phone is ridiculously smooth. ProMotion makes scrolling feel like butter, the battery life’s solid, and the cameras finally feel flagship-level even without the “Pro” tag. It’s funny — my OnePlus 7 Pro was the first phone that made me care about displays. And now, six years later, it’s Apple’s screen that’s making me smile every time I unlock it.\n\nFeels like a full cycle shifting from iPhone for better screen and specs and now — back with that familiar iPhone feeling I missed the past 6 years with “Pro” level upgrades.\n\nSafe to say, the iPhone 17 is exactly what I wanted it to be. A proper upgrade, not just a newer phone.\n",

    "selftext": "Every year we argue about titanium vs aluminum, bezels, battery cycles, camera bumps, charging speeds, AI buzzwords, etc… and then we completely ignore the one feature Apple shipped in the last few years that actually changed how you use the phone in daily life. Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

I also checked my car.\n\nWhat we did notice it that the first ping was near her school by her bus stop. (She rides the bus home). Then it followed her and pinged a few of her bus stop locations until finally reaching our house and then it was not reachable.\n\nShould we be worried?! I’m guessing it’s some kid on her school bus who parents used it to track their kid? This is the first time it’s happened.\n\nI tried to search for an AirTag on the find my app and my phone could not locate one. \n\nAny insight appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Apparently the demand just isn’t there? This is a device with very real compromises (not a dig, just an objective statement) but I would’ve expected it to sell well enough overall. I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra. Now I wonder…",

    "selftext": "Every year we argue about titanium vs aluminum, bezels, battery cycles, camera bumps, charging speeds, AI buzzwords, etc… and then we completely ignore the one feature Apple shipped in the last few years that actually changed how you use the phone in daily life. Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

    "selftext": "After 6 loyal years with my OnePlus 7Pro, the device finally gave up on me. It had been flawless all these years, but one random afternoon — mid doomscroll — it decided to retire. No drama, no warning it just switched off like, “That’s enough internet for one lifetime.” Just gone. \n\nThe local repair folks declared it a “CPU and RAM issue” — tech-speak for “it’s gone, bro.” Meanwhile, OnePlus customer support gave me the final nail in the coffin: “Your device has reached end of life. We don’t have spare parts anymore.”\n\nTranslation: We’ve moved on. You should too.\n\nAnd that’s when I knew it was time.\nEnter: the iPhone 17 🍏\n\nHonestly, this felt like the most obvious upgrade for me. I’d been waiting for Apple to bring ProMotion to the base models ever since I first experienced that silky 90Hz refresh rate on my OnePlus — and now that it’s here, it feels so worth the wait. The same screen as the iPhone 17 Pro, the bump in base storage, and that trademark Apple refinement — it feels like the first time in years the baseline model doesn’t feel “less than.” It’s smooth, fast, and feels complete.\n\nAnd then… there’s the Sage Green. 💚🤑\nI didn’t think a colour could make me fall in love with a phone, but this shade did it. It’s calm, clean, and has that understated premium vibe — not shouting for attention, just quietly flexing in good lighting. Easily one of Apple’s best colour choices in a long time.\n\nThe phone is ridiculously smooth. ProMotion makes scrolling feel like butter, the battery life’s solid, and the cameras finally feel flagship-level even without the “Pro” tag. It’s funny — my OnePlus 7 Pro was the first phone that made me care about displays. And now, six years later, it’s Apple’s screen that’s making me smile every time I unlock it.\n\nFeels like a full cycle shifting from iPhone for better screen and specs and now — back with that familiar iPhone feeling I missed the past 6 years with “Pro” level upgrades.\n\nSafe to say, the iPhone 17 is exactly what I wanted it to be. A proper upgrade, not just a newer phone.\n",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Samsung is canceling the upcoming s26 edge completly. but should it?\n\nCurrent reports say its because of poor sales of the 25 edge (only 178k in the first month) vs the other s series (s25 ultra with 1.5m, s25 with more than 1m). \n\nFor my opinion, the poor sales of the s25 edge were caused only because thats a new technology and it was mostly a prototype phone.\nIt had many problems and seemed rushed and unfinished (wasnt that thin, small battery, no telephoto camera). It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a Google Pixel 8, still under the EU 3-year legal warranty. The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

If I EVER try to record a video with flash it stops becusase It gets too hot. One time it got too hot even though it was -20 C outside. Even watching you tube videos too. at a low brightness\n\n\\-Battery life is comically short. I even have it set to the lower refresh rate and lower resolution. But its still terrible\n\n\\-Crashing. It cashes at least once a week, where I will be doing anything even during a important call and it will just fully shut down and not turn on for about 10-20 minutes. One time it turned off for 8 hours. then randomly turned back on when I was about to bring it to a store. Each time it was at a decently high battery percentage \n\n\\-editing photos takes way too long. even cropping, or writing on images will take a minute sometimes.\n\n\\-I have deleted so many things so its not because storage or things running in the background\n\n\\-It is somehow worse in every way then my old Samsung a71? which is older and much cheaper? \n\n  \nIm so disappointed because I thought it was going to be a great phone and it was my first more expensive phone yet it did so terribly.

The next time that I opened up Gmail on my Windows desktop computer, I had been logged out. Whelp. I run Gmail in Firefox on the computer. Gmail wouldn't let me sign back in to my Google account using 2 factor authentication.  Said they couldn't verify who I was. WTF? I have Google Authenticator on my Pixel phone. What more do they need? I had to unenroll from Advanced Protection on my phone in order to log back into webmail on the computer without having to wait 24-48 hours for \"account recovery\".  ",

I'd like to convert my family solely for the economic benefits for years to come. \n\nCost of phones and plans in Canada are ridiculous. I'm a bit of a techie but also a cheap bastard. I typically pick up the latest Pixel every two years for free or $5 or $10 month (Max!) plus cost of my plan $50/month unlimited. Easy.\n\nMy wife and kids all try for the newest iPhone they can get and pay handsomely for it. Wife pays $70/month (full purchase), kids pay between $15 and $30 per month on 24 month return plans. (We're all about $50 for talk text and data).\n\nFYI - kids pay for their phones and usage. \n\n\nI would like them to switch to save money as well as to not be so materialistic going forward as the orange man sends us all spiralling towards an economic depression.\n\nHas anyone successfully encouraged the switch with their loved ones?\n What are the incentives you used? \nAre there any youtube blogs relatable to terms to help? \n\nTIA\n\n",

The *exact* nightmare scenario I told myself I was safe from because I have the new Pixel 9.\n\nSo I pull it out, tap on the emergency SOS... and I get a \"Feature not available in your location\" message.\n\nIn Mexico.\n\nAre you f\\*cking kidding me? Satellites are GLOBAL. They don't just stop at the U.S. border. This isn't a tech problem, this is a \"Google couldn't be bothered\" problem.\n\nThis is North America. It works in the US. It works in Canada. But not in the massive country sitting right between them where millions of people travel, hike, and boat in remote areas all the time?\n\nI can't even describe that feeling in my gut. Going from \"Okay, we're in trouble, but I have a high-tech solution\" to \"Oh my god, we are completely screwed\" in one second.\n\nWe got lucky. Unbelievably lucky. A local netter saw us drifting and towed us back to shore. A total stranger in a tiny boat, not my $1,000 \"smart\" phone, was our rescue. I'm so grateful to him.\n\nBut I'm furious at Google. This is a life-saving feature being marketed as a reason to buy their phone, and it’s neutered by borders. It's a joke.\n\nJust a warning to everyone else: Don't you *ever* bet your life on this feature if you're traveling. It’s a gimmick until it works everywhere.\n\n**TL;DR: Boat ran out of gas in Mexico. Pixel 9 Satellite SOS doesn't work there. Saved by a local fisherman. The feature is a complete liability and a joke.**",

After perusing the available phones with my carrier, I found the pixel phones to have a nice look and I’ve heard they have good cameras! My problem… it feels like I can’t research a phone without finding reddit people listing at least 10 horrible things about it. \n\nSo, I’m wondering how the switch is from iPhone to Pixel. How does the battery life compare? For context, I’m looking at the Pixel 9 Pro, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. I have embarrassing high screen time. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows on my phone (through streaming apps). I also play some games that demand a lot of battery life (ex. Pokemon Go). \n\nFor pictures, I want to take beautiful pictures of my loved ones. That’s all I really care about. I don’t like the beautified, filtered look of photos from Samsung. \n\nI use a lot of google products already (google calendar, gmail, google photos, etc.)\n\nThanks for any/all advice!!",

    "selftext": "I visited F1 Service (1mg mall) in Bengaluru to get my swollen battery replaced. It was a global issue, and Google offered the replacement free of charge. Unfortunately, my screen had a crack in the upper corner, and as per their policy, they had to replace it. So I had to pay INR 7249. Got it in 4 hours. They urged a five-star review, and that's fine.\n\nWithin 3 weeks, the screen started going black in the area where the fingerprint sensor is. I took it to the store and they agreed as it was <90 days for a free replacement. \n\nAfter a while, they opened it and they said they found water inside the phone. I casually mentioned, it must have been the rain. They charged me another INR 850 for an investigation, and they came back with a back panel and droplets in a specific area. Not trying to accuse them, but it did look fresh. Not sure any phone can handle that. \n\nUltimately rejected the warranty and said it'll cost me INR 26K for a new display, motherboard, camera and battery, so maybe get a new phone. I asked the lady, but how is the time being shown if the motherboard is gone? She said it's temporary and it'll stop working soon.\n\n  \nIt's been more than 10 days since this incident, and my phone works perfectly well apart from the display. I am using Google Talkback and Google Assistant, and it works just as normal (Alarms, calls, messages). Had to use a USB keyboard to unlock after switching on, else it unlocks via face. All with a blank display. I have important data and banking apps in there.\n\nTried writing to the Google service, but they don't care. Scripted emails about how they are \"actively investigating\" for more than a week.\n\n  \nWhat are my options here? Have any of you faced any similar situations? \n\n  \nPS: Even tried casting the phone using an HDMI cable, unfortunately, it's available from Pixel 8 series. ",

I pulled out my Pixel 9 Pro (still on Camera 9.9) and compared... yup. They flipped the sliders. That's moderately annoying considering most people probably don't study the brightness/shadows icons that well and a surprise change like this can result in a very frustrating experience if you're used to these sliders from years ago.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nakHWuh.png",

    "selftext": "I've had issues with my Pixel 9 Pro since I got it in December.\n\nTo describe the issues, it starts with the autobrightness. In dim light, the screen will be at full brightness. Adjusting the brightness scale will only change the hue where \"dimmest\" setting is teal and \"brightess\" setting is red and the middle is neutral. u/Raychii took a video of the exact issue. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1k8s7qh/intermittent_screen_discolouration_on_pixel_9_pro/mp8pghn/ When this happens, the always on display will not work either. The full brightness in a dark room burns my eyes when I try to use my phone.\n\nI tolerated it this long because I used to be able to \"force\" the autobrightness to work by adjusting the brightness scale to the middle two times in a row. It would finally adjust the brightness and the always on display would work.\n\nBut that would stop working again when I put my phone in my pocket and walked around. The brightness would be 100% again with the same issues described above.\n\nLately, some new update disabled that workaround. The phone has a mind of its own when I can adjust the brightness. You cannot imagine my frustration of wanting to throw the phone against the wall when it's on 100% brightness all the time. I might end up trading the phone and going back to Samsung if I can't find a fix.",

Come to find out it was none of these (in my case). I finally decided to just disable 5gUW, turned on wifi, turned off doze stopper, and reenabled all the optimisation settings just for the hell of it and wouldn't you know it, I got all my notifications without a hitch. No delay, and every notification told me what exactly it was notifying me of. \n\nWhen I was on IOS I never had this issue, and this is a really big bummer for me cause I switched to pixel because I wanted to try out android since it's been so long and the pixel felt like the most iphone feeling android device so it made switching easier. Sadly tho, I'm more of a first impressions kind of guy so I'm probably going back to IOS after dealing with this headache for almost 2 months. Now I only use 5gUW if I can't get wifi signal anywhere which blows cause now a feature I pay for is severely hindered.",

    "selftext": "Context: I live in Germany and Google support has offered me the option to send me a replacement device for my month old Pixel 9 due to potential OLED image retention/burn-in issues (anyone else with this issue?)\n\nWas wondering if anyone has experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany, because I have a few questions:\n\n1. Do they reject your RMA claims even for the slightest cosmetic damage? (My phone has a single minor hairline scratch on the screen and based on the other stories about RMA in the EU, I'm worried I'm going to have to go without a phone for 2 weeks only for my claim to get rejected and I cannot afford to go without a phone for so long)\n\n\n2. Does it actually take 5-10 business days as Google says, or is it longer? Does the phone get shipped to Poland?\n\n\n3. Do they always only send refurbished replacements or do they send new ones sometimes too? (One support agent told me the device will be brand new, the other one wasn't so clear, but I don't think I can rely on their word because based on other stories in this sub, there seems to be no consistency b/w their support agents and what their actual RMA/repair partner in Europe does, let alone among their own support agents itself)\n\n\nI was also told by Google support that I could get my phone repaired at Comspot (Google's authorized repair partner in Germany). They offer walk-in same-day repairs. My only gripe with this is repairing the phone instead of replacing it may void the water resistance rating, which is a real shame for a phone that's only a month old.\n\n\nWhat do y'all think? Should I risk RMA-ing it, or wait it out, see how the burn-in situation goes and based on that just go to the repair center (Comspot)?",

Birthday thing was coming round so I was looking forward to double discount but alas not. Anyway I get a Pixel 9 for a decent price.\n\nSetup and transfer from the old one suvks. With Apple it takes 30 mins and just works. With Google it installedy apps but that's about it.\n\nAnyway a few weeks later some observations:\n\n1. Battery is v good. A day in Disney and it's still at 50%. You need to use the park app a lot. \n\n2. Biometrics are awesome. Soooo much faster and reliable.\n\n3. Camera is great. I want an easy point and shoot with good quality results. This is it. Portrait mode rocks.\n\nHope that helps someone! Peace.",

Lately I can stare at my watch for 15-30 seconds while walking around and not see it update... then all the sudden it'll add a few 100 steps.   \n   * Note, I restarted the watch and it seems to mostly be working now?\n   * I'm not sure what caused this, possibly turning off my phone?  Leaving my watch to function 100% independently and then when my phone was back in proximity it glitched out?\n* I've had frequent issues where attempting to unlock my device, it acts like it's unlocked but won't load any app icons and shows a blank background image.  I press the lock button and try again and it works. \n   * This isn't unique to a Pixel 10 experience, most phones every so often do this but seems far more common on my pixel 10?",

    "title": "A Post About Disappointment – My First Flagship Phone (Pixel 10 Pro)",
    "selftext": "This is not a hate post. It’s something way more sad in my opinion. It’s a **disappointment post**. But let me start from the beginning.\n\nI've never had a **flagship phone**, mostly because they were simply too expensive to afford. But I've always been a phone geek, checking new models, new features, and watching countless reviews and comparisons on YouTube. In my life, I've had many phones from different brands, but as I said, never a flagship. And the phone I always craved the most, the one that always got my attention, was the **Google Pixel**.\n\nThe year 2025 came, and I decided this was the moment. Two months after my 33rd birthday, I bought the **Pixel 10 Pro** on the day it premiered. I can’t describe the emotions and dopamine rush I got in that moment. There, in a few days, I was going to own the newest flagship, the pinnacle of technology. Fast forward one month, and that's why I'm writing this post.\n\nI've used the Pixel for over a month, and on a daily basis, I can’t say anything bad about the phone. It looks fantastic, the build quality feels good, and I like the camera and overall performance in daily usage (I'm not a benchmark guy, nor do I do a lot of mobile gaming). However, there are some things that truly made me disappointed after so many years of craving a Google flagship phone.\n\nTo not make this already long post any longer, I’m going to list the things that, in my opinion, are **unacceptable**:\n\n**1.** I know this is a new standard, but I don’t like it, and I’m going to say it loud. Buying a phone for 1370 EUR / $1590 (the 512GB version, price from my country) where you don’t even get a **charger** really feels like a rip-off (i know all brands does it).\n\n**2.** After a month of using it, I discovered there are some **noises coming from the Pixel**. My first thought: \"Oh my god, it's broken.\" I was devastated. You should have seen my face when I discovered the whole **\"rattle gate\"** issue. I mean, your phone sounding like something is broken inside whenever you move it faster gives a terrible experience. Even though it doesn't affect performance, this is not what I was expecting from a flagship for that much money. Big disappointment. Guess you can get used to it though.\n\n**3.** In my one+ month of using the Pixel 10 Pro, I had about **3 separate occasions in which I was unable to make a call**. Just like that. I don't have 2G connection blocked or anything like that. I wanted to call someone, but it never actually started dialing. The problem disappeared only after a **phone reset**.\n\nIn my two-year experience with a $200 Redmi, I never once had such a case. Do I need to tell you how disappointing this is? It's actually a big problem. What if the call I'll be making is very important, or time is crucial? \"Oh sorry, this time you can't call, reset your phone.\" This actually gives me anxiety each time I'm calling now because i don't know if i'll be able to. After investigating a bit, I encountered a lot of posts and articles about problems with the modem/GSM module (sorry if thats not it, not really a technical guy) in Pixel phones. So, it's not something new either. Calling is a basic feature of phones, and now the Pixel is failing in this as well?\n\n**4.** Last but not least, I became a Google Pixel fan mostly because of their **\"pure Android experience\"**—the whole \"you can customize what you want,\" etc. But it turns out, you can't even customize the main screen! The Google search bar is **unremovable**, as is the date/calendar add-on. They *have* to be there. Quite a small choice for a \"customize everything phone.\" Same goes for function buttons, you can't swap the order. I mean c'mon google.\n\nWith the date add-on(or widget - not really sure how to call it), I'm also actually getting a **bug** where sometimes it disappears, but when I click the place on the screen where it's supposed to be, the calendar opens. After restarting the phone, I see the widget again. So, that’s another weird thing.\n\nI don't want this to be another hate post. Before buying this phone I was the biggest Pixel fanboy ever. I really do like this phone despite all the issues. This is just the perspective of someone who got his first flagship in 2025, from a company he always thought was the best in the business. And I’m just **disappointed**.",

After perusing the available phones with my carrier, I found the pixel phones to have a nice look and I’ve heard they have good cameras! My problem… it feels like I can’t research a phone without finding reddit people listing at least 10 horrible things about it. \n\nSo, I’m wondering how the switch is from iPhone to Pixel. How does the battery life compare? For context, I’m looking at the Pixel 9 Pro, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. I have embarrassing high screen time. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows on my phone (through streaming apps). I also play some games that demand a lot of battery life (ex. Pokemon Go). \n\nFor pictures, I want to take beautiful pictures of my loved ones. That’s all I really care about. I don’t like the beautified, filtered look of photos from Samsung. \n\nI use a lot of google products already (google calendar, gmail, google photos, etc.)\n\nThanks for any/all advice!!",

Unfortunately, my screen had a crack in the upper corner, and as per their policy, they had to replace it. So I had to pay INR 7249. Got it in 4 hours. They urged a five-star review, and that's fine.\n\nWithin 3 weeks, the screen started going black in the area where the fingerprint sensor is. I took it to the store and they agreed as it was <90 days for a free replacement. \n\nAfter a while, they opened it and they said they found water inside the phone. I casually mentioned, it must have been the rain. They charged me another INR 850 for an investigation, and they came back with a back panel and droplets in a specific area. Not trying to accuse them, but it did look fresh. Not sure any phone can handle that. \n\nUltimately rejected the warranty and said it'll cost me INR 26K for a new display, motherboard, camera and battery, so maybe get a new phone. I asked the lady, but how is the time being shown if the motherboard is gone? She said it's temporary and it'll stop working soon.\n\n  \nIt's been more than 10 days since this incident, and my phone works perfectly well apart from the display. I am using Google Talkback and Google Assistant, and it works just as normal (Alarms, calls, messages). Had to use a USB keyboard to unlock after switching on, else it unlocks via face. All with a blank display. I have important data and banking apps in there.\n\nTried writing to the Google service, but they don't care. Scripted emails about how they are \"actively investigating\" for more than a week.\n\n  \nWhat are my options here? Have any of you faced any similar situations? \n\n  \nPS: Even tried casting the phone using an HDMI cable, unfortunately, it's available from Pixel 8 series. ",

    "title": "Phone Stopped working after brief power outage - while it was in my pocket?",
    "selftext": "I had the most bizarre thing happen yesterday. There was a brief power outage in my home; lights went out for a few seconds, then came back on. During that time, my phone, a Google Pixel 4a 5G,  was in my pocket. I pulled it out to use it as a light, and it was dead. Completely off, nothing I did seemed to register. The power button has been a bit wonky on it, but It has a fingerprint sensor on the back that normally will unlock and turn on the screen without a physical button press, that didn't work though. \n\n  \nI've since been able to inconsistently get it to the fastboot menu, but unable to actually launch it. I'm attributing that to the physical buttons. I need to try using the fastboot utility, but \n\n1.  have any of you ever heard of a power outage breaking a phone like this? What is just random happenstance?\n2. Any advice on unbricking it? I've found the following threads:\n   1.

After perusing the available phones with my carrier, I found the pixel phones to have a nice look and I’ve heard they have good cameras! My problem… it feels like I can’t research a phone without finding reddit people listing at least 10 horrible things about it. \n\nSo, I’m wondering how the switch is from iPhone to Pixel. How does the battery life compare? For context, I’m looking at the Pixel 9 Pro, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. I have embarrassing high screen time. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows on my phone (through streaming apps). I also play some games that demand a lot of battery life (ex. Pokemon Go). \n\nFor pictures, I want to take beautiful pictures of my loved ones. That’s all I really care about. I don’t like the beautified, filtered look of photos from Samsung. \n\nI use a lot of google products already (google calendar, gmail, google photos, etc.)\n\nThanks for any/all advice!!",

It cashes at least once a week, where I will be doing anything even during a important call and it will just fully shut down and not turn on for about 10-20 minutes. One time it turned off for 8 hours. then randomly turned back on when I was about to bring it to a store. Each time it was at a decently high battery percentage \n\n\\-editing photos takes way too long. even cropping, or writing on images will take a minute sometimes.\n\n\\-I have deleted so many things so its not because storage or things running in the background\n\n\\-It is somehow worse in every way then my old Samsung a71? which is older and much cheaper? \n\n  \nIm so disappointed because I thought it was going to be a great phone and it was my first more expensive phone yet it did so terribly.

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "I’ve used the S22 Ultra before and really liked the design and One UI, even though the battery life wasn’t the best. Now I’m looking at the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra and wanted to hear from people who’ve spent time with them.\n\nOn paper they seem very close, but I’m curious about how they actually feel day to day. How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

But that was my fault to not have backup.\n\n\n\nAnyway, i gotten a cheap Xiaomi phone to use until i was back to my country since i acquired Samsung care+.\n\nOnce returned and submitted it to the Samsung costumer center they mentioned few times, it will be a free repair unless water damage is detected.\n\nOf course, i kept the phone relatively well, but it received its shares of water splashes, and knowing very well what waterproof mean in the phone world i was ready to pay the 93\\~USD of screen change out of warranty. (The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra? I guess i use it as a Dex PC. ",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

The pixel figured this out a long time ago.  Is there some weird licensing thing that stops Samsung from making an obvious design choice?  Are they just that desperate to sell cases?  For the life of me, I can't see the upside to configuring it the way that they do.",

Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I’m going to start to train to load and start. ",

Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "Samsung galaxy s25 edge 1 month review - Underrated",
    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "title": "Here's how I fixed up my galaxy watch 8c battery issue.",
    "selftext": "This is a post to help you folks who are stuck with a watch that dies in 8 hours.\n\nBefore I start, let me just clarify that I don't have a fixed solution for you. I'll tell you what I tried, and what worked.\n\nI got my galaxy watch 8c LTE edition on September 13th. Bought it from a store, enabled whatever I wanted, used it.\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that the battery dies within the day.\n\nI started measuring. I was wearing it to sleep, I was using it to exercise, I was using it like how a proper smart watch is supposed to be used. On an average I got 10-12 hours out of it. 10% battery drain per hour.\n\nI started looking into solutions. Searched reddit, forums, samsung issue resolutions.\n\nSome had this issue because of the Gemini constantly listening. Some had it because they had AOD on. But these folks already had a battery life that spanned atleast 20+ hours. This fix wasn't for me.\n\nThen the next group of people had a solution - clear the cache partition or do a factory reset. Or do both.\nFor some, the cache clear worked. For some the reset did. For some, doing both did it.\n\nSo started my 2 week long experimenting on improving battery life.\n\nClearing cahe partition didn't do much. I cleared again. Nothing.\nI reset the watch. Still showed 12 hours.\n\nSomeone pointed out to do it twice - no idea why - but tried that.\nStill the same.\n\nAfter 3 days of trial and error, my watch suddenly showed 22hrs.\nI didn't do anything much. I had cleared the partition and reset the watch earlier that day.\n\nHoping it would improve again, I repeated this process - twice.\nAfter setting it up as a new watch for God knows how many times, it switched back to showing 12-15h.\n\nHere is when I noticed that the battery drain has a direct correlation with the network settings.. \nI checked my connection settings - wifi, mobile data etc were set to auto. That would mean that when my phone was away, they would use what's needed and would be off when I'm using it with my phone nearby. \n\nBut it seemed that the watch was not turning it off. It was connected to my watch, but not always through bluetooth. It would switch sometimes to wifi and LTE even when the phone was in my pocket. \n\nThis was the root cause. Don't know what caused it, but my samsung phone was not exactly paired to my samsung watch.\n\nI cleared cache partition. That didn't do much. I hard reset the watch multiple times till I ensured it was pairing properly.\n\nAnd immediately I got 1day+12 hours battery life. That's the same amount as promised by samsung with everything on.\n\nAll you have to do is just check if only bluetooth is enabled on the watch menu while your phone is near.\n\nDo some hard resets, clear cache - as many times as needed to ensure only bluetooth icon is visible when phone is near. The wifi and LTE symbols should be off if you're normally wearing your watch. Update your settings to auto. This will get you 1.5 days of battery life with AOD off. If you need more than 36 hours of battery life, then do the things others did - turn off AOD, switch off Gemini, set heart rate to measure every 10 mins etc. that's gonna get u that 2 day battery life.\n\n I still don't know why or what's causing it. Maybe my phone has too many bluetooth devices connected to it. Maybe my watch hates my phone in secret. Who knows. But this should fix it.\n\ntldr; read last 3 paragraphs. Good luck.\n\nPS : not a native English speaker. Sorry for the language.\n\n",

The 40mm fits better on my wrist but if i would cancel my order id have to pay 339€ instead of the 259 i wouldve payed for the watch. Ive got quite a slim wrist and now my question is, would the 44mm would fit good if i would use other bands then the Standard one? I ofc i like the 44mm better because it has more battery and a bigger screen tho, the 40mm looks better on my wrist but if it still wouldnt fit better with other bands i might have to pay 80€ more to get the 40mm at standard price :( please let me know if anyone ever encounterd this problem",

    "selftext": "Hey Using galaxy watch 7 ultra When trying to search for a location, google speach services opens instead of the keyword (voice search) There is no option switching to keyword What is wrong? Anyone is facing that? Keyword works perfectly in all other apps Using Gboard as default keyword Didnt change any settings lately, suddenly started.\n\n  \nIm using Gboard as my default keyboard. Ive tried changing my voice search engine to samsung (maybe I have there an option to change to keyboard?) But it still uses google with no option to change the input for the keyboard.\n\nThis happens only in google Maps.\n\nNo available apps update/ software updates. Everything is up to date.\n\nSamsung build in keyboard works but I cant use it as my keyboard language does not support full size keyboard (its T-9) and thats why I switched to google keyboard\n\nI dont understand why, after so many years, samsung and google have so many issues and lack of support (such as my language and everything ive talked about) on their products and apps\n\nStill thinking of a way how to manipulate this bug/feature and use gboard keyboard on maps",

Still, I’m happy I didn’t overspend just to chase the newest trend. 😅\n\nNow I’m looking to pick up a **Galaxy Watch Classic** to go with it. I want something that feels premium, lasts a few years, and doesn’t make me feel like I have to upgrade every time Samsung releases a new one. Basically, something that’s good enough to keep and forget about the hype cycle.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n* **Watch 4 Classic** – budget-friendly, but maybe too dated now?\n* **Watch 6 Classic** – seems like the sweet spot for value and performance.\n* **Watch 8 Classic** – newer, but not sure if the price jump is worth it.\n\nFor anyone rocking a Fold + Watch combo:  \nWhich Classic model do you think hits the best balance between **price, features, and longevity**?  \nI’m aiming for that “buy it once and chill” kind of setup.

Go into your modes and routines and just toggle those settings off in the sleep mode.

    "selftext": "Those who are thinking about getting a Galaxy Watch Ultra, just to be safe in terms of battery life.\n\nYou can get a Galaxy Watch 8 classic LTE, plus a Galaxy Watch 7 40mm bt/Wi-Fi for the same amounts of money and basically get infinite battery life. \n\nThe 8 classic should be fine for most people and usages, usually drains 30%/40% of what you started the day with. \nSo it can last you two days easily, or you can shortly charge it during showering, brushing your teeth etc. \n\nOr you can get a now discounted watch 7, the smallest size and without LTE because you're only gonna use it for sleep tracking 🤠\n\nIt's very seamless to switch between Galaxy Watches, Samsung has Optimised for this for many years now. \n\nYes, the Ultra has some other nice perks like a bigger screen, and it is also sometimes on sale. \nThere's a whole Galaxy of possibilities you know ",

Can’t wait to see if it motivates me or just roasts me for my “brisk walking” pace.\n\nBut seriously, can someone explain why some of these new features aren’t available on the other Galaxy Watches?\nSame sensors, same everything — but nope, Samsung said “you can look, but you can’t touch.”\n\nHaving Facer back is great though. I’ve already changed my watch face three times today because apparently commitment isn’t my thing.\n\nAlso, the grouped notifications — chef’s kiss. Finally, my wrist doesn’t look like it’s having a notification panic attack.\n\nOverall, One UI 8 feels like a solid glow-up. Just wish Samsung didn’t sprinkle in that classic “you can’t have this yet” energy.",

    "title": "Here's how I fixed up my galaxy watch 8c battery issue.",
    "selftext": "This is a post to help you folks who are stuck with a watch that dies in 8 hours.\n\nBefore I start, let me just clarify that I don't have a fixed solution for you. I'll tell you what I tried, and what worked.\n\nI got my galaxy watch 8c LTE edition on September 13th. Bought it from a store, enabled whatever I wanted, used it.\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that the battery dies within the day.\n\nI started measuring. I was wearing it to sleep, I was using it to exercise, I was using it like how a proper smart watch is supposed to be used. On an average I got 10-12 hours out of it. 10% battery drain per hour.\n\nI started looking into solutions. Searched reddit, forums, samsung issue resolutions.\n\nSome had this issue because of the Gemini constantly listening. Some had it because they had AOD on. But these folks already had a battery life that spanned atleast 20+ hours. This fix wasn't for me.\n\nThen the next group of people had a solution - clear the cache partition or do a factory reset. Or do both.\nFor some, the cache clear worked. For some the reset did. For some, doing both did it.\n\nSo started my 2 week long experimenting on improving battery life.\n\nClearing cahe partition didn't do much. I cleared again. Nothing.\nI reset the watch. Still showed 12 hours.\n\nSomeone pointed out to do it twice - no idea why - but tried that.\nStill the same.\n\nAfter 3 days of trial and error, my watch suddenly showed 22hrs.\nI didn't do anything much. I had cleared the partition and reset the watch earlier that day.\n\nHoping it would improve again, I repeated this process - twice.\nAfter setting it up as a new watch for God knows how many times, it switched back to showing 12-15h.\n\nHere is when I noticed that the battery drain has a direct correlation with the network settings.. \nI checked my connection settings - wifi, mobile data etc were set to auto. That would mean that when my phone was away, they would use what's needed and would be off when I'm using it with my phone nearby. \n\nBut it seemed that the watch was not turning it off. It was connected to my watch, but not always through bluetooth. It would switch sometimes to wifi and LTE even when the phone was in my pocket. \n\nThis was the root cause. Don't know what caused it, but my samsung phone was not exactly paired to my samsung watch.\n\nI cleared cache partition. That didn't do much. I hard reset the watch multiple times till I ensured it was pairing properly.\n\nAnd immediately I got 1day+12 hours battery life. That's the same amount as promised by samsung with everything on.\n\nAll you have to do is just check if only bluetooth is enabled on the watch menu while your phone is near.\n\nDo some hard resets, clear cache - as many times as needed to ensure only bluetooth icon is visible when phone is near. The wifi and LTE symbols should be off if you're normally wearing your watch. Update your settings to auto. This will get you 1.5 days of battery life with AOD off. If you need more than 36 hours of battery life, then do the things others did - turn off AOD, switch off Gemini, set heart rate to measure every 10 mins etc. that's gonna get u that 2 day battery life.\n\n I still don't know why or what's causing it. Maybe my phone has too many bluetooth devices connected to it. Maybe my watch hates my phone in secret. Who knows. But this should fix it.\n\ntldr; read last 3 paragraphs. Good luck.\n\nPS : not a native English speaker. Sorry for the language.\n\n",

I ofc i like the 44mm better because it has more battery and a bigger screen tho, the 40mm looks better on my wrist but if it still wouldnt fit better with other bands i might have to pay 80€ more to get the 40mm at standard price :( please let me know if anyone ever encounterd this problem",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been using the **Fold 6** for a while now ! love it overall, though I do have a bit of buyer’s regret here and there. Still, I’m happy I didn’t overspend just to chase the newest trend. 😅\n\nNow I’m looking to pick up a **Galaxy Watch Classic** to go with it. I want something that feels premium, lasts a few years, and doesn’t make me feel like I have to upgrade every time Samsung releases a new one. Basically, something that’s good enough to keep and forget about the hype cycle.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n* **Watch 4 Classic** – budget-friendly, but maybe too dated now?\n* **Watch 6 Classic** – seems like the sweet spot for value and performance.\n* **Watch 8 Classic** – newer, but not sure if the price jump is worth it.\n\nFor anyone rocking a Fold + Watch combo:  \nWhich Classic model do you think hits the best balance between **price, features, and longevity**?  \nI’m aiming for that “buy it once and chill” kind of setup. Appreciate any input 🙏",

They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

    "selftext": "This is a post to help you folks who are stuck with a watch that dies in 8 hours.\n\nBefore I start, let me just clarify that I don't have a fixed solution for you. I'll tell you what I tried, and what worked.\n\nI got my galaxy watch 8c LTE edition on September 13th. Bought it from a store, enabled whatever I wanted, used it.\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that the battery dies within the day.\n\nI started measuring. I was wearing it to sleep, I was using it to exercise, I was using it like how a proper smart watch is supposed to be used. On an average I got 10-12 hours out of it. 10% battery drain per hour.\n\nI started looking into solutions. Searched reddit, forums, samsung issue resolutions.\n\nSome had this issue because of the Gemini constantly listening. Some had it because they had AOD on. But these folks already had a battery life that spanned atleast 20+ hours. This fix wasn't for me.\n\nThen the next group of people had a solution - clear the cache partition or do a factory reset. Or do both.\nFor some, the cache clear worked. For some the reset did. For some, doing both did it.\n\nSo started my 2 week long experimenting on improving battery life.\n\nClearing cahe partition didn't do much. I cleared again. Nothing.\nI reset the watch. Still showed 12 hours.\n\nSomeone pointed out to do it twice - no idea why - but tried that.\nStill the same.\n\nAfter 3 days of trial and error, my watch suddenly showed 22hrs.\nI didn't do anything much. I had cleared the partition and reset the watch earlier that day.\n\nHoping it would improve again, I repeated this process - twice.\nAfter setting it up as a new watch for God knows how many times, it switched back to showing 12-15h.\n\nHere is when I noticed that the battery drain has a direct correlation with the network settings.. \nI checked my connection settings - wifi, mobile data etc were set to auto. That would mean that when my phone was away, they would use what's needed and would be off when I'm using it with my phone nearby. \n\nBut it seemed that the watch was not turning it off. It was connected to my watch, but not always through bluetooth. It would switch sometimes to wifi and LTE even when the phone was in my pocket. \n\nThis was the root cause. Don't know what caused it, but my samsung phone was not exactly paired to my samsung watch.\n\nI cleared cache partition. That didn't do much. I hard reset the watch multiple times till I ensured it was pairing properly.\n\nAnd immediately I got 1day+12 hours battery life. That's the same amount as promised by samsung with everything on.\n\nAll you have to do is just check if only bluetooth is enabled on the watch menu while your phone is near.\n\nDo some hard resets, clear cache - as many times as needed to ensure only bluetooth icon is visible when phone is near. The wifi and LTE symbols should be off if you're normally wearing your watch. Update your settings to auto. This will get you 1.5 days of battery life with AOD off. If you need more than 36 hours of battery life, then do the things others did - turn off AOD, switch off Gemini, set heart rate to measure every 10 mins etc. that's gonna get u that 2 day battery life.\n\n I still don't know why or what's causing it. Maybe my phone has too many bluetooth devices connected to it. Maybe my watch hates my phone in secret. Who knows. But this should fix it.\n\ntldr; read last 3 paragraphs. Good luck.\n\nPS : not a native English speaker. Sorry for the language.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I would like to get a new laptop, brand new or used, and preferably as light as possible, but I'm seeking for a really specific criteria:\n\n6th-10th Gen Intel CPU + GPU, No DGPU. GOOD build quality, I want this as a fairly portable laptop so I do not want it to break just from daily use. Also two slots for a 2.5' HDD + M.2/SATA SSD configuration. I don't care about built-in storage / ram capacity as I will just swap those myself if needed.\n\nOptionally, some USB-C ports and also USB-C PD charging, or at least USB3. I don't care for other ports like Ethernet, HDMI, standard USB, card readers, or whatever else laptops have on them. I pretty much have more than enough USB-C adapters for any use.\n\nWhy so specific? I need it for a triple (yes, triple) boot between windows + hackintosh + linux. Not too fussed about hackintosh/linux support on certain things like sound or networking so literally anything that is light AND has any sort of CPU between a 6th-10th gen would do fine.  Also, no budget, but cheaper is better obviously.\n\nAlso, I do NOT care about exterior build quality, scratchability, or all of that kinda fuss tied to cleanliness. Its main environment will be in pretty rough places by default, so it's going to get (extermally) damaged with a lot of blemishes.\n\nThank you!",

I do not plan to do any gaming on the laptop, only running VMs, some Emulators maybe and coding/testing for XPlane.\n\nI have had my eyes on a refurbed Macbook M1 Pro, XPlane runs on MacOS and it’s well optimized for that. I’ve been looking for Dell Inspirons, Lenovo Thinkpads and other random brand laptops as well. I’ve seen the Macbooks have very good battery life, but the Thinkpads and Ispirons have great prices. An M1 Pro refurbed mac costs 550€ for context.\n\nI have had my eyes on this laptop:\n\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/elNLsnQ\n\nRyzen 9 6900HX, 32GB DDR5 Ram and 1TB NVMe all for 555€, and it has a 2560x1600 display!

    "selftext": "I had to do a lot of disassembly to get to a part that needed replacement on a HP ProBook 6870b, when this happened. One side is completely shattered, and the other is looking better but still has some cracks (second image). Now I need one more part. I need to replace the top cover. They are cheap for a laptop this old, if you can find one.\n\nBut instead of replacing the top cover, I thought about trying some epoxy glue from JB Weld or another brand. As you can see, I still have some bits of plastic, and I'm saving those to try and put them back in their original location (filler material). Ideally, I think it would be best to use something that not only fuses two pieces of plastic together but also adds new material to fill the gaps, that can be shaped into right size later on. I saw that JB Weld has something like that.\n\nI have never used JB Weld products before, or done this kind of repair before, or broken something like this before. So this is all unknown to me. I don't even have JB Weld where I live, and no one has even heard of this brand, but I will order it online.\n\nHas anyone in this sub done this repair (attempt) before? With success? Or failed it? I saw [one post](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/e7blms/what_could_i_use_to_glue_this_hinge_back_onto_the/) from 6 years ago, where someone linked to a YouTube video where some guy from India did it. But that was the end of the discussion. It was more important apparently for the guy that replied with the link what laptop brand OP had, so he could avoid it. It turned out he had the same brand! LOLZ! I have the same brand! It's a HP. So what? Any brand laptop can brake at the hinges if you don't pay attention and do it wrong. I learned my lesson.\n\nActually, this is a very serviceable laptop, with socketed CPU, the old school era where you could do all kinds of service on it. But the service manual for it is trash! Lots of inaccuracies and missing info, like having to remove 2 PH1 screws underneath the keyboard to release the bottom cover, and it doesn't emphasize that you should remove the 4 T8 screws at the back last! I learned this the hard way.",

What should I do during the first setup?\n\n\n2. Which options should I turn on or off (like privacy settings, updates, Lenovo apps, etc.)?\n\n\n3. Should I connect to Wi-Fi and update everything first, and then create a restore point or backup?\n\n OR\n\n\n4. Should I skip connecting to Wi-Fi, create a restore point first, and then update later?\n\n\n\nBasically, I just want to avoid messing things up and set it up properly from the start.\nAny setup tips or must-do steps would be awesome.\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏",

    "selftext": "**Model/SKU:** Lenovo\\_MT\\_81NS\\_BU\\_FM\\_Legion Y7000 2019  \n**Specs:** RTX 2060, i5-9750H\n\n**Issue:**  \nAfter replacing the charging port (first DIY, then redone by a repair shop), the laptop now shows on boot:\n\n>\n\nCharging is intermittent. During a Windows reinstall it charged up to 11%, then after switching Windows power mode from Battery Saver to Best Performance it stopped charging again. After windows got reinstalled for a few minutes before changing the power setting it was charging even though the charging icon was not displayed in the corner. After changing it back to power saving it wouldn't charge again.\n\n**What I’ve tried:**\n\n* Original OEM charger.\n* Brand-new OEM charger.\n* BIOS has no charging options on this model.\n\n**Context:**  \nThe first DIY jack worked for a while but later failed because the solder job wasn’t solid. I replaced the jack again at a service center. Since then I get the low-wattage warning even with OEM chargers. I have tried discharging the laptop several times.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Why would the system flag “lower wattage” with genuine chargers after a DC-in jack replacement?\n2. Is this likely an ID/sense pin or cable issue on the DC-in board, a missing resistor, or EC/firmware problem?\n3. Any safe way to bypass the warning so it charges normally?\n4. What should I check or replace next (DC-in board/cable, battery, EC reset, CMOS reset, etc.)?\n\nAny guidance or known fixes for this 2019 Legion Y7000 would help.",

    "selftext": "I would like to get a new laptop, brand new or used, and preferably as light as possible, but I'm seeking for a really specific criteria:\n\n6th-10th Gen Intel CPU + GPU, No DGPU. GOOD build quality, I want this as a fairly portable laptop so I do not want it to break just from daily use. Also two slots for a 2.5' HDD + M.2/SATA SSD configuration. I don't care about built-in storage / ram capacity as I will just swap those myself if needed.\n\nOptionally, some USB-C ports and also USB-C PD charging, or at least USB3. I don't care for other ports like Ethernet, HDMI, standard USB, card readers, or whatever else laptops have on them. I pretty much have more than enough USB-C adapters for any use.\n\nWhy so specific? I need it for a triple (yes, triple) boot between windows + hackintosh + linux. Not too fussed about hackintosh/linux support on certain things like sound or networking so literally anything that is light AND has any sort of CPU between a 6th-10th gen would do fine.  Also, no budget, but cheaper is better obviously.\n\nAlso, I do NOT care about exterior build quality, scratchability, or all of that kinda fuss tied to cleanliness. Its main environment will be in pretty rough places by default, so it's going to get (extermally) damaged with a lot of blemishes.\n\nThank you!",

It was all very sudden, and even though I haven't been able to try another charger I really much doubt it was that since the battery light usually blinks to indicate there's no charge. \nI opened it to see if maybe something got disconnected but everything seemed to be in order, I have fixed it before myself but this time I'm completely dumfounded. \nIs it worth it to take it to a repair shop or should I just get some used one for my basic needs?",

One side is completely shattered, and the other is looking better but still has some cracks (second image). Now I need one more part. I need to replace the top cover. They are cheap for a laptop this old, if you can find one.\n\nBut instead of replacing the top cover, I thought about trying some epoxy glue from JB Weld or another brand. As you can see, I still have some bits of plastic, and I'm saving those to try and put them back in their original location (filler material). Ideally, I think it would be best to use something that not only fuses two pieces of plastic together but also adds new material to fill the gaps, that can be shaped into right size later on. I saw that JB Weld has something like that.\n\nI have never used JB Weld products before, or done this kind of repair before, or broken something like this before. So this is all unknown to me. I don't even have JB Weld where I live, and no one has even heard of this brand, but I will order it online.\n\nHas anyone in this sub done this repair (attempt) before? With success? Or failed it? I saw [one post](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/e7blms/what_could_i_use_to_glue_this_hinge_back_onto_the/) from 6 years ago, where someone linked to a YouTube video where some guy from India did it. But that was the end of the discussion. It was more important apparently for the guy that replied with the link what laptop brand OP had, so he could avoid it. It turned out he had the same brand! LOLZ! I have the same brand! It's a HP. So what? Any brand laptop can brake at the hinges if you don't pay attention and do it wrong. I learned my lesson.\n\nActually, this is a very serviceable laptop, with socketed CPU, the old school era where you could do all kinds of service on it. But the service manual for it is trash! Lots of inaccuracies and missing info, like having to remove 2 PH1 screws underneath the keyboard to release the bottom cover, and it doesn't emphasize that you should remove the 4 T8 screws at the back last! I learned this the hard way.",

Can I use three of those fans and mount them onto the NZXT radiator instead of the current ones?\n\nFor some reason, I was expecting something like a Corsair Commander to come with the NZXT AIO, but it didn’t come with anything like that.

My monitor has a d-pad control, and I've tried changing the input but the menu never appears for this-- I'm not sure if its broken-- but the monitor has no issue auto-detecting input for my laptop. The exception for the black screen boot is that one time I tried booting, the screen brought up a screen like in [this post](http://reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/1ccxmho/new_cpu_installed_ftpmpsp_nv_corrupted_or_ftpmpsp/), on which I pressed Y. \n\nIt rebooted, the fans spun up near max, then it went back to doing the same thing. I have removed the CMOS battery since, following the motherboard manual, and this reset did not help. I'm wondering if this card is DOA, or if there is something I'm missing. I don't know how the Y/N would have booted without the GPU, since I dont have integrated graphics as far as I'm aware. I have checked ram seating, but have not done single stick booting yet, because its quite a job to get out. I have also ensured full seating on the 12VHPWR cable on both sides-- they are flush and I checked all pins. \n\n  \nAlso, I booted without the GPU installed to see the LEDs on the motherboard-- they are very hard to see otherwise due to my case design. In this instance, they cycled down to VGA, then got stuck (which I assume is expected-- again, newbie). I cannot see the lights clearly while the gpu is installed, but it seems to be stuck in the same location (not sure, though). \n\n  \nAny advice or insight is greatly appreciated! I'm willing to provide more information as needed. I'm just trying to get into BIOS so I can see if everything is detected.\n\n  \nThanks!",

Is TR AQUA ELITE 360 V3 a good aio cooler in terms of quality?\nAs far as I know pretty much any aio cooler should be good in terms of efficiency for my build (r5 9600x + rx 9060 xt), but I want one for aesthetics and maybe noise (although idk how much quieter it would be than let’s say - peerless assassin 120).\nHowever, I’ve heard that decent air coolers can last almost indefinitely, while budget aio coolers can start leaking after only two years, while costing twice as much.\nSo, is the aio in title good?\nWill ot last?\nAre there any other problems or things I should know about?\nIs there maybe a better aio at a similar price?\nThanks in advance",

My current setup is:  \n  \n\\- i5-9400f  \n\\- asrock motherboard  \n\\- 2 ddr4 memory sticks: one hyperx fury 8gb 2400mhz and one t-force 8gb 2666mhz  \n\\- gtx 1660 super   \n\nEverything works fine.\n\nThe thing is I recently bought a gigabyte h610m-k ddr4 motherboard and an intel i5-12400f in order to upgrade my setup, as well as a new case. Now, I transfered the whole setup to the new case, swapping the motherboard and the CPU for the new ones I bought. However, when I turn the PC on, the monitor does not display any video and the other peripherals (mouse and keyboard) also don't light up, as if they're not even on. After trying some things (reseating the gpu and the cpu, cleaning the cpu and gpu sockets, etc) I found out that removing one of the memory sticks makes the PC work just fine. So I tested a little more and concluded that putting any single stick in any of the memory sockets will work, but combining them using the two sockets won't work, no matter the configuration. Does anyone got any clue of what to do?",

Shopping in Norway also brings a bit of a challenge in terms of availability, so that might be a limiting factor.\n\nI'm holding out for potential deals during black monday/black week/cyber monday/whatever, so just checking if I'm all set.\n\nWouldn't normally prefer a vertically oriented cabinet, but that's there as a compromise with the missus, who also uses the desk for her home office, so that it'll fit nicely in the corner behind the desk legs.\n\n**EDIT: Forgot what I plan to use it on. 1440p gaming, mostly.

I'm planning on spreading out my purchases because it'll just be easier for me financially, but I know I need to plan out everything I'm going to get beforehand to ensure that all the components are compatible. I've found the website pcpartpicker thanks to a friend's recommendation, but I still don't really know where to start. I'll be using my pc mostly for gaming and also occasionally for Microsoft Excel for work. Gaming-wise, I don't play anything too crazy. Mostly games like Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Sims, Fortnite, etc (please don't judge my game choices, I haven't been a gamer for long, and I'm not very good still lol), so I know I won't need anything too intense to run what I want to play and do. I'm also on a pretty tight budget, so whatever I can get that has the most bang for my buck would be great. I also want it to be easy to upgrade individual parts as needed as time goes on. I don't want to have to start from scratch with a whole new pc in the next 5-10 years, if possible. So with that info, I guess I would just love some advice on what part/parts I should pick out first, what I should save for last, and what minimum processing power, memory, etc, I should aim for based on my needs. Thank yall so much in advance!",

My CPU cooler is an MSI MAG CoreLiquid A13 240mm.\n\nI think GPU, due to its weight, size, or the small distance between D\\_LED port, is putting pressure on the ARGB cable from the CPU cooler, which is plugged into the D\\_LED port.

Because the ARGB cables for the lights on the fan and processor are different, and my motherboard only has one port, I'm using an adapter to connect them to a single one.   \n  \nI've tried placing a support bracket under my graphics card but didn't work. I don't wanna rise it up higher because I think it might damage the PCIe and I keep opening the case, removing the graphics card, and reconnecting the cable again and again and it is very frustrating.

    "title": "It's time to ask the experts, PC will not boot 9 out of 10 times, Black Screen with a white dash in top left corner, Bricked after Windows 11 25H2 Update",
    "selftext": "HELP NEEDED, BADLY\nAnd I'm real sorry about the long description, but just trying to relay as much info as possible on the issue. \n\nI need some help here everyone. Ive got a Ryzen 7800X3D build on an MSI X670e Tomahawk board (7E12V1G bios) and an RTX GPU. I've been running this setup on Windows 11 24H2 for some time now without issue. \n\nHowever, 2 days ago I allowed Windows Update Manager to install 25H2 (doesn't mean problem wasn't already present, I just didn't notice any issues until performing this update). During the restart process, it got stuck and never made it to 100%, forcing me to hard reboot. Upon hard reboot, got black screen with dash at top left. Proceeded to cycle power several times, and eventually managed to get into BIOS menu. Noticed all settings had been reset to 'default settings' so set everything the way it was before, EXPO on, X3D enabled, set ram speed , etc.. all pretty basic stuff... Then saved and quit and the computer booted up into Windows. At this time, I thought I was having a display driver issue so performed a fresh install of Nvidia drivers and rebooted. Black screen again except this time, power cycling took many many tries to finally boot into BIOS, would not boot to startup on its own unless I opened BIOS first, made no changes, and quit BIOS to return to start up. \n\nChecked event viewer and noticed several errors. 1 was for the display adapter driver needing to be installed (which was why I reinstalled Nvidia driver), and there also several errors to seemed to indicate the 25H2 update had failed, unfortunately I did not notate these errors as I did not anticipate this would become  such a difficult issue to solve. In hindsight I should have logged all information I was able to come across. \n\nAt this point, I tried to reinstall the upgrade through Windows Update recovery settings, (Reset PC, reinstall Windows but keep all personal files and folders). The update performed on screen and looked fine until reset upon which I got black screen. Eventually I did manage to get a complete fresh 25H2 installed on disk, but still had black screen issue which I can sometimes get to go to BIOS but 95% of time its just stuck at black screen.\n\nThings I have tried since, having to cycle power each time and randomly finally able to get into BIOS, and then exit back and proceed to a startup... \n- reset CMOS by removing battery\n- reflashed bios w/ same version 7E12V1G, no change\n- booted to recovery mode and attempted Windows Startup Repair, no changes\n- booted to recovery mode and performed fresh windows 11 25H2 install, same issue and install took several hard resets to complete as each time it reset it would boot to black screen not allowing install to finish\n- updated all drivers for X670e, same issue\n- finally got fresh windows 11 25h2 installed, but still same issue, possibly getting worse, having a real hard time getting it past black screen now even with many power cycles\n\n- once it is up and running, it runs ok, but dies seem to be hanging up during quite a few processes \n- x670e debug led normal\n- all fans and lights normal\n\nNext I wanted to update the BIOS to 7E12V1J and reinstall fresh Windows 11 24H2 but now I can't get back in no matter what I do.\n\nI fear I've got some hardware problem, maybe firmware somehow got corrupted .. It not looking like I have the expertise necessary to solve this. I think I may have even made things worse tinkering so much and losing all trail of what may have happened. \n\nSorry this was a long description but I've been at it for hours already. I will appreciate any and all input, but will be especially thankful for recommended diagnostic procedures from this point on. \n\nThank you all. ",

She’s not a huge gamer like myself (hoping to change that), but I got her into Grounded and she loved it. And she also enjoys messing around on the gta games so when the new one comes out, I tried to have it work with that as well. With cross play being difficult and just the lack of games having it available I decided it’s time to get rid of the console and just get her a pc, endless opportunities there.\n\nSo if you have any better recommendations for the list please let me know! I tried to keep the pink/white theme for her but also tried to keep the budget close to 1000.\n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/rqPRrM\n\n \nLast question is could I save a few bucks and get the windows dvd instead of the usb?

    "selftext": "Recently built a pc on budget. Went with an i5-14600K paired up with an RTX5060Ti 16gb. But since I was trying to stay on my budget as much as I could I had to buy a cheap mobo. Picked up a Gigabyte H610M-K DDR4 Rev 2.0 and it seems that this was such a newbie move and trust me I thought I was just the opposite till now. Tried running few on ultra with DLSS(BF2042, Spider Man 2, Cyberpunk 2077) and they ran pretty much above my expectations. But each game had one issue in common, they had regular hiccups every 2 minutes. Installed HWinfo and Riva Tuner to look into temps and everything seemed fine CPU was below 60C and GPU was below 70C at any time under heavy load (including the 3 games given above). But at the same time, same load, the Vcore VR was always above 100C and every time it goes above 105 it stutters so bad and CPU clocks go down to 0.80Ghz. So I guess I have to go get a new mobo, but please if you are willing to provide any suggestions for a new mobo please please keep in mind that I am still on a budget and our economy is on the floor. Thanks for reading this unnecessarily long text about a simple problem :)",

I've found the website pcpartpicker thanks to a friend's recommendation, but I still don't really know where to start. I'll be using my pc mostly for gaming and also occasionally for Microsoft Excel for work. Gaming-wise, I don't play anything too crazy. Mostly games like Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Sims, Fortnite, etc (please don't judge my game choices, I haven't been a gamer for long, and I'm not very good still lol), so I know I won't need anything too intense to run what I want to play and do. I'm also on a pretty tight budget, so whatever I can get that has the most bang for my buck would be great. I also want it to be easy to upgrade individual parts as needed as time goes on. I don't want to have to start from scratch with a whole new pc in the next 5-10 years, if possible. So with that info, I guess I would just love some advice on what part/parts I should pick out first, what I should save for last, and what minimum processing power, memory, etc, I should aim for based on my needs.

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nThanks to your feedback regarding my current situation, I’ve got a much better understanding of my dilemma.\n\nSomeone suggested that it might be worth getting an entirely new system and I don’t doubt that. It’s just not within my possibilities right now though.\n\nIn my eyes, I’ve got these options:\n\n1. Save up for a new AM5 system\n2. Max out my AM4 system with a 5800XT or 5800X3D and a matching GPU\n\n2.1. Then build an AM5 system later\n\n3. Go with option 2, but instead build a new AM6 system in around 3–4 years\n\nIf I spend around **500–700 €** on a new CPU and GPU now (that my PSU can handle), I’ll have more fun for a couple of years. Then there’s a good chance I can upgrade straight to an AM6 system later, instead of “wasting” money I don’t really have on an expensive AM5 setup that might lead to the same situation again in a few years.\n\nOf course, I know that with tech, this will always be the game - and that’s just how things are. Still, I’d love to hear different opinions on my plan.\n\nI’ve got an **HP Omen 32c (2560×1440, 165 Hz)** monitor, and right now (According to the steam overlay) I’m getting around **80–100 FPS** without frame generation or anything like that, on **auto low (everything low)** settings.  \nMy goal would be a smoother experience with higher settings; ideally **120 + FPS on mid–high settings at 1440p**.\n\nMy idea is that I could enjoy a noticeably better experience now and for upcoming games, until I’m in a better financial situation. This way, I’m making the most out of my current setup and by skipping AM5, I’d actually turn my dilemma into a reasonable long-term plan.  \nIs there anything that speaks against this idea?\n\n**For reference, my specs:**\n\n* **Mainboard:** MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 3700X\n* **GPU:** 8 GB Gainward GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Phantom GS\n* **RAM:** 32 GB G.Skill DDR4-3200\n* **PSU:** 550 W be quiet! Straight Power 11 Modular 80+ Gold\n* **Case:** be quiet! Dark Base 700\n* **Cooling:** Corsair Hydro Series H100i Platinum + be quiet! Silent Wings 3 PWM",

Fortunately it happened outside the case, unfortunately it was not plunged in so there was no ground for the charge to dissipate into. The PC boots ok but I am still feeling a little spooked. I am hoping that because the charge had the whole case and PC to dissipate into it did not hit any sensitive components too hard. If it made it to the motherboard it would have likely been through the grounding standoffs but I don't know if that is good or bad. If anyone with more electrical knowledge can chime in I would appreciate it.\n\n\n\nThe irony here is that the whole reason I redid my pc is because I had bought a smaller case than I wanted in order to avoid a having a glass panel but ended up caving later. Guess where the static charge came from? from peeling the the protective plastic off the glass panel I did not want in the first place. Watch out when out peeling plastic protective film as it can cause you to build a static charge. I normally wear an ESD band but had taken it off because I was no longer working with internal components.\n\n\n\nAs a couple bonus tips to anyone reading or coming from Google later:\n\nYou can fit a Arctic Freezer III 420 with push pull fans (37mm rad + 2* 27mm fans) just fine up top in a Fractal Meshify 2 XL.\n\nThe Arctic Freezer III AM5 mounting system sucks and is a pain to install. I found that loosening the left bracket, starting the threading on both AIO screws, and only then tightening everything down is much easier than doing it the \"correct\" way. The problem is the the AIO screws are under tension and are prone to only letting you get one screw stated before flexing and making it impossible to thread the other screw. They don't even give you any locating pins to help hold the cold plate in aliment while you try to screw it in.",

I’m looking to buy and build a pc for my gf and have come up with a list and would like some better insight, tips, or other parts that would be better used/substituted, from people who are not myself, who actually know what they are doing lol. \n\nThe pc would be used for gaming mainly, some web browsing. She’s not a huge gamer like myself (hoping to change that), but I got her into Grounded and she loved it. And she also enjoys messing around on the gta games so when the new one comes out, I tried to have it work with that as well. With cross play being difficult and just the lack of games having it available I decided it’s time to get rid of the console and just get her a pc, endless opportunities there.\n\nSo if you have any better recommendations for the list please let me know! I tried to keep the pink/white theme for her but also tried to keep the budget close to 1000.\n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/rqPRrM\n\n \nLast question is could I save a few bucks and get the windows dvd instead of the usb? I already have a usb that I can put a creation tool on so I only really need the activation code I think?",

I know the i9 would be best for pretty much everything including workloads and not much of a difference between both CPU’s when playing at higher resolutions. But just a curious question to which one actually performs better at 4K even if the average is 1 fps higher. Also to mention this rig will be 99% for gaming. I just keep seeing benchmarks between the two for 1080p and not 4K. And I know the am5 platform is gunna stick for a while longer and intel keeps changing platforms but this is strictly about performance. ",

I'm using a be quiet! Pure Power 12M 1000W PSU. I hooked up the GPU with the 12VHPWR cable (my psu supports this directly, and does not provide 3 cables for use with the adapter). \n\nThe GPU fans spin, but has no signal with either DP or HDMI connection (it is in the gpu, not motherboard, and I have tried all ports). The monitor will illuminate, say \"no signal,\" change to a plain black screen, then enter sleep mode. My monitor has a d-pad control, and I've tried changing the input but the menu never appears for this-- I'm not sure if its broken-- but the monitor has no issue auto-detecting input for my laptop. The exception for the black screen boot is that one time I tried booting, the screen brought up a screen like in [this post](http://reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/1ccxmho/new_cpu_installed_ftpmpsp_nv_corrupted_or_ftpmpsp/), on which I pressed Y. \n\nIt rebooted, the fans spun up near max, then it went back to doing the same thing. I have removed the CMOS battery since, following the motherboard manual, and this reset did not help. I'm wondering if this card is DOA, or if there is something I'm missing. I don't know how the Y/N would have booted without the GPU, since I dont have integrated graphics as far as I'm aware. I have checked ram seating, but have not done single stick booting yet, because its quite a job to get out. I have also ensured full seating on the 12VHPWR cable on both sides-- they are flush and I checked all pins. \n\n  \nAlso, I booted without the GPU installed to see the LEDs on the motherboard-- they are very hard to see otherwise due to my case design. In this instance, they cycled down to VGA, then got stuck (which I assume is expected-- again, newbie). I cannot see the lights clearly while the gpu is installed, but it seems to be stuck in the same location (not sure, though). \n\n  \nAny advice or insight is greatly appreciated! I'm willing to provide more information as needed. I'm just trying to get into BIOS so I can see if everything is detected.\n\n  \nThanks!",

But at the same time, same load, the Vcore VR was always above 100C and every time it goes above 105 it stutters so bad and CPU clocks go down to 0.80Ghz.

I'm planning on spreading out my purchases because it'll just be easier for me financially, but I know I need to plan out everything I'm going to get beforehand to ensure that all the components are compatible. I've found the website pcpartpicker thanks to a friend's recommendation, but I still don't really know where to start. I'll be using my pc mostly for gaming and also occasionally for Microsoft Excel for work. Gaming-wise, I don't play anything too crazy. Mostly games like Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Sims, Fortnite, etc (please don't judge my game choices, I haven't been a gamer for long, and I'm not very good still lol), so I know I won't need anything too intense to run what I want to play and do. I'm also on a pretty tight budget, so whatever I can get that has the most bang for my buck would be great. I also want it to be easy to upgrade individual parts as needed as time goes on. I don't want to have to start from scratch with a whole new pc in the next 5-10 years, if possible. So with that info, I guess I would just love some advice on what part/parts I should pick out first, what I should save for last, and what minimum processing power, memory, etc, I should aim for based on my needs.

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nThanks to your feedback regarding my current situation, I’ve got a much better understanding of my dilemma.\n\nSomeone suggested that it might be worth getting an entirely new system and I don’t doubt that. It’s just not within my possibilities right now though.\n\nIn my eyes, I’ve got these options:\n\n1. Save up for a new AM5 system\n2. Max out my AM4 system with a 5800XT or 5800X3D and a matching GPU\n\n2.1. Then build an AM5 system later\n\n3. Go with option 2, but instead build a new AM6 system in around 3–4 years\n\nIf I spend around **500–700 €** on a new CPU and GPU now (that my PSU can handle), I’ll have more fun for a couple of years. Then there’s a good chance I can upgrade straight to an AM6 system later, instead of “wasting” money I don’t really have on an expensive AM5 setup that might lead to the same situation again in a few years.\n\nOf course, I know that with tech, this will always be the game - and that’s just how things are. Still, I’d love to hear different opinions on my plan.\n\nI’ve got an **HP Omen 32c (2560×1440, 165 Hz)** monitor, and right now (According to the steam overlay) I’m getting around **80–100 FPS** without frame generation or anything like that, on **auto low (everything low)** settings.  \nMy goal would be a smoother experience with higher settings; ideally **120 + FPS on mid–high settings at 1440p**.\n\nMy idea is that I could enjoy a noticeably better experience now and for upcoming games, until I’m in a better financial situation. This way, I’m making the most out of my current setup and by skipping AM5, I’d actually turn my dilemma into a reasonable long-term plan.  \nIs there anything that speaks against this idea?\n\n**For reference, my specs:**\n\n* **Mainboard:** MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 3700X\n* **GPU:** 8 GB Gainward GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Phantom GS\n* **RAM:** 32 GB G.Skill DDR4-3200\n* **PSU:** 550 W be quiet! Straight Power 11 Modular 80+ Gold\n* **Case:** be quiet! Dark Base 700\n* **Cooling:** Corsair Hydro Series H100i Platinum + be quiet! Silent Wings 3 PWM",

    "selftext": "I had just finished rehousing my PC into larger case (a Fractal Meshify 2 XL) and just closed the side panel when it happened. Fortunately it happened outside the case, unfortunately it was not plunged in so there was no ground for the charge to dissipate into. The PC boots ok but I am still feeling a little spooked. I am hoping that because the charge had the whole case and PC to dissipate into it did not hit any sensitive components too hard. If it made it to the motherboard it would have likely been through the grounding standoffs but I don't know if that is good or bad. If anyone with more electrical knowledge can chime in I would appreciate it.\n\n\n\nThe irony here is that the whole reason I redid my pc is because I had bought a smaller case than I wanted in order to avoid a having a glass panel but ended up caving later. Guess where the static charge came from? from peeling the the protective plastic off the glass panel I did not want in the first place. Watch out when out peeling plastic protective film as it can cause you to build a static charge. I normally wear an ESD band but had taken it off because I was no longer working with internal components.\n\n\n\nAs a couple bonus tips to anyone reading or coming from Google later:\n\nYou can fit a Arctic Freezer III 420 with push pull fans (37mm rad + 2* 27mm fans) just fine up top in a Fractal Meshify 2 XL.\n\nThe Arctic Freezer III AM5 mounting system sucks and is a pain to install. I found that loosening the left bracket, starting the threading on both AIO screws, and only then tightening everything down is much easier than doing it the \"correct\" way. The problem is the the AIO screws are under tension and are prone to only letting you get one screw stated before flexing and making it impossible to thread the other screw. They don't even give you any locating pins to help hold the cold plate in aliment while you try to screw it in.",

Of course, I didn't get angry with him because it can happen to anyone, but still the question torments me. What is the probability that the processor is broken? I examined it, everything looks fine, the cover is in place. I can't start and check it yet because the rest of the components will arrive only in a week",

To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

    "selftext": "Okay, yes, I'm a fan of VTM: Bloodlines. The visuals, the music, the story with all the hidden stuff, the voice acting... Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

It’s pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound’s coming from. I don’t see any technical reason why we can’t have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

Developing for VR has definitely been a different experience compared to normal game development .. challenging at times if I have to be honest.   \n  \nI’ve learned a lot along the way and willing to learn more especially with the help and feedback from the community! In this game you have to get to your objectives by blowing your trench whistle but the catch is the enemies can hear your whistle too, footsteps on wooden floor (if they squeek), dropping bottles or hitting them, etc. Thanks for checking it out!

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

Developing for VR has definitely been a different experience compared to normal game development .. challenging at times if I have to be honest.   \n  \nI’ve learned a lot along the way and willing to learn more especially with the help and feedback from the community! In this game you have to get to your objectives by blowing your trench whistle but the catch is the enemies can hear your whistle too, footsteps on wooden floor (if they squeek), dropping bottles or hitting them, etc. Thanks for checking it out!

At least Fortnite. \n\nI went in and tried everything, from windows settings, to turn off/on windows sonic. \n\nBut they just sounded a bit muffled. I am normally using hd560s sennheiser with jackstick. But I have an adapter that makes them usb a as well. They sound the same in Fortnite. \n\nSo a couple of questions. \n\n1, using a usb A device / adapter, will it override the soundcard in my pc?\n\n2, can it possibly be, that the new headset and when using an adapter for my sennheiser, make the sound just be less great compared to using jackstick hd560s with the Dolby Atmos I have as my soundcard sound program so to speak.\n\nI know that a pair of headphones are better in general. But I just want to make sure that I'm not making a mistake when plugin in a Usb A adapter/device. \n\nCause if there is a solution to getting them to sound better, then Im all ears.\n\nBut if there is nothing to do and that's just the \"quality\" of sound they can produce, then I'm not so frustrated as it seems right now.\n\nSo can the usb a adapter/headset really make the sound more awful like that? \n\nYoutube and Spotify sounded as great as the jackstick option. However Fortnite not so much\n\nHope someone understands and can answer :)",

Plus I do on occasion like to play some old games. As much as I don't like windows, I think it's what's most comfortable and useful to me right now.\n\nI have had two Intel NUCs, I have a beast canyon in my closet and I had a hades canyon a couple years ago. They both have weird issues, because Intel seems to drop support for them very fast leading to weird quirks and unresolved issues I didn't enjoy working around.\n\nI also used a Beelink GTI14, which again had great performance, but the company itself is terrible. The SD card slot didn't work and the company just kept insisting that my cards were incompatible and fought me for almost a month trying to get them to allow me to return it. Eventually I opened a case with my bank and suddenly the return got approved. Horrible company, and the driver support was non-existent. I had to email customer support to get drivers for the pc and again, who knows when they'll stop supporting it. All of that to say that I am no longer open to those Chinese minipc companies unless there is one that is highly reputable.  \n",

    "selftext": "Just from browsing this subreddit, I know the general consensus around these SATA power to 8-pin power adapters is that they are generally unsafe due to insufficiently spec-ed power supplies. My power supply does not come with 8 pin power adapters because they are redundant Dell server power supplies.\n\nMy system is a Dell T610 that I use for self-hosted cloud storage. I want to get hardware transcoding acceleration working on my Nextcloud instance because video playback is painfully slow at the moment without it. But my T610 only comes with PCIE 2.0x8 slots, which only deliver 25 watts of power at most.\n\nI cannot find any H.264 GPUs that run on less than 25 watts of power and fit in a PCIE x8 physical slot. There are some H.264-enabled GPUs that can fit a PCIE x8 slot, but they consume more than 25 watts of power and would need supplemental power to work.\n\nSince my Dell T610 power supplies don't have 8-pin power adapters, the only means I can think of to provide this supplemental power would be through the several free SATA power ports on the motherboard, each of which can presumably provide 54 watts of power. This would free up my power budget a lot and allow me to find hardware transcoding cards.\n\nWhat do you guys think? And what are some other alternatives?",

    "selftext": "I, alongside with my dad and cousins, built my old computer back in 2017. It had awesome specs back in the day, with an i7-8700k, originally 16, now 32GB of DDR4 RAM and a good old GTX 1060.\n\nFinally after a while, I decided to buy myself a new computer. This one's rocking a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32GB DDR5 Corsair RAM, and a lovely 9070XT 16GB model. My 1060 had 6GB! This jump will be awesome.\n\nI've decided to put it all in this Phanteks Evolv S2 case after seeing it on one of Optimum's YouTube videos. Truly does look stunning. Unfortunately, my flooring is carpet so I have this smoothed off wooden plank that I have underneath and there are legs on this case, so it isn't suffocating. The temps are good with 37⁰c idle and the motherboard being around 32⁰c. I've yet to place it under any stress testing however.\n\nI do feel very icky about this purchase. It costed me roughly $3000 AUD ($2000 USD), and this was something I purchased all on my very own. I kept debating whether I even needed a new computer and I kept saying to myself \"I don't, I don't, I don't\" even though there was occasional artefacts showing on the display, the display randomly black screening and occasional freezes despite reinstalling Windows multiple times on SSD. It was something that I definitely needed, but it's the first time I've ever spent this amount of big money before.\n\nIn any case (pun totally intended) though, this computer will definitely last me another 8+ years. I can't wait to have a ton of fun with this PC. \n\nSee y'all in another 8+ years when I build my next PC loll",

It had awesome specs back in the day, with an i7-8700k, originally 16, now 32GB of DDR4 RAM and a good old GTX 1060.\n\nFinally after a while, I decided to buy myself a new computer. This one's rocking a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32GB DDR5 Corsair RAM, and a lovely 9070XT 16GB model. My 1060 had 6GB! This jump will be awesome.\n\nI've decided to put it all in this Phanteks Evolv S2 case after seeing it on one of Optimum's YouTube videos. Truly does look stunning. Unfortunately, my flooring is carpet so I have this smoothed off wooden plank that I have underneath and there are legs on this case, so it isn't suffocating. The temps are good with 37⁰c idle and the motherboard being around 32⁰c. I've yet to place it under any stress testing however.\n\nI do feel very icky about this purchase. It costed me roughly $3000 AUD ($2000 USD), and this was something I purchased all on my very own. I kept debating whether I even needed a new computer and I kept saying to myself \"I don't, I don't, I don't\" even though there was occasional artefacts showing on the display, the display randomly black screening and occasional freezes despite reinstalling Windows multiple times on SSD. It was something that I definitely needed, but it's the first time I've ever spent this amount of big money before.\n\nIn any case (pun totally intended) though, this computer will definitely last me another 8+ years. I can't wait to have a ton of fun with this PC. \n\nSee y'all in another 8+ years when I build my next PC loll",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

    "selftext": "Finally got my setup to a place I’m happy with, so figured I’d share. My old chair’s recline mechanism broke and it was basically stuck in full chill mode 24/7. It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

    "selftext": "I've been playing FPS game for a while, using Ikea solid wood tabletop with 2 alex drawer on each side, and a regular office chair, but i have been having pain on my right back muscle where I hold my mouse, I'm thinking it's the chair problem, so after a few months I bite the bullet and bought the HM Embody gaming chair.\n\nUnfortunately that doesn't seems to fix my problem and seems to make it worse in some way, because I want good control on my mouse, I want my elbow to be slightly or same level of my desk on my sit up straight position, but that means I would have to put my chair near the highest height, and my footrest of 12cm are barely touching my feet, not really feel supported.\n\nThen, my thigh and leg feel numb, because the embody chair seems to be softer on the back, and it cut off blood circulation for my entire thigh and leg, this impact my gaming performance by huge, always adjusting myself feels like something is off.\n\nI'm 5'9\" (175cm) and 219lbs (99kg), could this be my overweight problem (I'm trying to lose weight...) and my desk problem, i feel like the right desk height should be my current desk height \\~75cm minus my footrest 12cm, so the ideal desk height for me is something around 63\\~65cm? i don't really see desk that are that low...\n\nAnyone have solution to the issue?",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

Overall feels expensive.\n\nBuild quality 10/10 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mpl47f4fowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae90f1ab48f6aab4d5b4eadaf9bd55c81359175d\n\nThe keyboard looks pretty darn well first look, giving off that \"cute aesthetic\" vibe to it (IMHO), I was a bit disappointed because my whole setup is dark/black and the keyboard is standing out between all the dark parts of my PC. I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/osqvzf04zpwf1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934d86fd6b2611ac9c1986eb8209ea86c09bf7b4\n\nA quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper.\n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone as some reccomended it to me but GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust AI 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at an odd location. \n\nWhat other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

Overall feels expensive.\n\nBuild quality 10/10 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mpl47f4fowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae90f1ab48f6aab4d5b4eadaf9bd55c81359175d\n\nThe keyboard looks pretty darn well first look, giving off that \"cute aesthetic\" vibe to it (IMHO), I was a bit disappointed because my whole setup is dark/black and the keyboard is standing out between all the dark parts of my PC. I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/osqvzf04zpwf1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934d86fd6b2611ac9c1986eb8209ea86c09bf7b4\n\nA quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

Overall feels expensive.\n\nBuild quality 10/10 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mpl47f4fowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae90f1ab48f6aab4d5b4eadaf9bd55c81359175d\n\nThe keyboard looks pretty darn well first look, giving off that \"cute aesthetic\" vibe to it (IMHO), I was a bit disappointed because my whole setup is dark/black and the keyboard is standing out between all the dark parts of my PC. I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

I can switch to DCI-P3 to oversaturate everything, but this particular color will still appear less saturated compared to others.

Both of these monitors are 4k, and I think they both have a matte finish (though I’d prefer a semi-matte or ideally gloss finish based on my experience with my laptops).\n\nGoals: crispiest possible image during gaming.\n\nUse case: non-competitive gaming (Skyrim, Fallout, Elden Ring, Mass Effect, etc), CAD/CAM, media, and general productivity (data processing, figure creation, and simulations for my PhD).\n\nWhat I like about the Gigabyte:\n• OLED (supposedly better image?)\n• Higher refresh rate\n• Lower latency\n\nWhat I like about the Samsung:\n• Curved display\n• Larger\n• Less expensive\n\nMy concerns:\n• I’ve heard of issues with the Samsung, but it sounds like a firmware update and some settings adjustments can fix the VRR flicker and scan line images that people have complained about.\n• I really do prefer curved monitors, but Rtings.com has the Gigabyte monitor as one of their best, and with it only being $200 more, this feels like a no-brainer for most people.\n\nDoes anyone have any firsthand experience with either of these monitors that can chime in? Or, if anyone has any other recommendations, I’m open to that too. The only things that I’m strongly against are the ultra-wide monitors. A friend of mine has an ultra-wide Alienware and I did not like gaming in that when he let me try it (much to his disbelief 😂). Trying to keep the price less than $1k for the monitor, so please bear that in mind if you’re going to make a monitor suggestion.\n\nThanks, peeps! 😁",

I am also planning on getting GTA 6 amongst other graphic heavy games, so I need the colour, refresh rate and resolution to be pretty top notch.

The arm is fine to be honest, but as soon as I mounted it the first time, I noticed that to move, rotate and tilt the smaller monitor was a LOT easier and smothier than the 27 one, specially tilting. I know this is a limitation of the arm per se, because is a cheap one and the arm has to be more tighten in order to keep the heavier monitor from sagging.\n\n\n\nWould a heavy duty arm with a higher weight rated capacity improve this? Thinking about getting the heavier version of the same model, Pixio PS2D.",

I am using this HDMI cable [https://www.jumbo.ae/hama-ham-122221-high-speed-hdmia-cable-plug-plug-ethernet-gold-plated-2-0-m.html](https://www.jumbo.ae/hama-ham-122221-high-speed-hdmia-cable-plug-plug-ethernet-gold-plated-2-0-m.html) and I bought it in 2021.\n\nI want to buy:\n\n1.

I am unsure if the soundbar will automatically pair again when it switches on so pairing by bluetooth is messy.\n\nMy laptop and the monitor don't have HDMI ARC.\n\nThe simplest solution is I use an AUX audio cable but if I do that then I will lose the surround sound and I don't want that.\n\nThus the remaining option is I use optical and I have to get an HDMI audio extractor box. I have to connect my laptop to HDMI input of the box and connect the monitor to the HDMI output of the box. The box should have an optical port for the audio and I will connect the soundbar to it and I should get surround sound if I do that. When the electricity cuts then the tv, sound bar and the HDMI audio extractor box will switch off but everything should resume when they switch back on.\n\nThere are some cheap quality HDMI audio extractor boxes which say 4k 60hz. They could be 60hz at 1080p so that means that I will get 60hz on the monitor if I use a cheap quality HDMI audio extractor box. Thus I need to buy a proper HDMI 2.1 audio extractor box like [https://www.amazon.com/Extractor-Optical-Adapter-Speakers-Headphones/dp/B0FCYVBZPK/ref=sr\\_1\\_4](https://www.amazon.com/Extractor-Optical-Adapter-Speakers-Headphones/dp/B0FCYVBZPK/ref=sr_1_4) which supports 1080p 120hz and it could give me 144hz. Is what I said correct?\n\nMy HDMI wire is old and it could be HDMI 2.0 certified. Is that ok or I need to buy a new HDMI wire which is HDMI 2.1 certified? I think that a HDMI 2.0 certified wire is enough for 1080p 120hz or 144hz and I don't need a HDMI 2.1 certified wire. Is what I said correct?",

It’s been quite a while and now I see more brands than ever selling seemingly similar product with a price all over the place. \n\nThe criteria is as follows:\n- 24” monitor (can be 23.8” and 24.5”);\n- 1920x1080 (FHD);\n- IPS panel preferred though VA is also an option if a deal is good (sometimes doing some photo editing as I do photography as a hobby);\n- At least 180hz;\n- Budget of ~100eur/116USD (though the budget is approximate and can be a bit more expensive).\n\n\n",

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "selftext": "Ok. So I’m building my first PC and I’m torn between the two monitors and I need help from you monitor gurus because I’m not really sure what the best route is. Both of these monitors are 4k, and I think they both have a matte finish (though I’d prefer a semi-matte or ideally gloss finish based on my experience with my laptops).\n\nGoals: crispiest possible image during gaming.\n\nUse case: non-competitive gaming (Skyrim, Fallout, Elden Ring, Mass Effect, etc), CAD/CAM, media, and general productivity (data processing, figure creation, and simulations for my PhD).\n\nWhat I like about the Gigabyte:\n• OLED (supposedly better image?)\n• Higher refresh rate\n• Lower latency\n\nWhat I like about the Samsung:\n• Curved display\n• Larger\n• Less expensive\n\nMy concerns:\n• I’ve heard of issues with the Samsung, but it sounds like a firmware update and some settings adjustments can fix the VRR flicker and scan line images that people have complained about.\n• I really do prefer curved monitors, but Rtings.com has the Gigabyte monitor as one of their best, and with it only being $200 more, this feels like a no-brainer for most people.\n\nDoes anyone have any firsthand experience with either of these monitors that can chime in? Or, if anyone has any other recommendations, I’m open to that too. The only things that I’m strongly against are the ultra-wide monitors. A friend of mine has an ultra-wide Alienware and I did not like gaming in that when he let me try it (much to his disbelief 😂). Trying to keep the price less than $1k for the monitor, so please bear that in mind if you’re going to make a monitor suggestion.\n\nThanks, peeps! 😁",

I can switch to DCI-P3 to oversaturate everything, but this particular color will still appear less saturated compared to others.

Both of these monitors are 4k, and I think they both have a matte finish (though I’d prefer a semi-matte or ideally gloss finish based on my experience with my laptops).\n\nGoals: crispiest possible image during gaming.\n\nUse case: non-competitive gaming (Skyrim, Fallout, Elden Ring, Mass Effect, etc), CAD/CAM, media, and general productivity (data processing, figure creation, and simulations for my PhD).\n\nWhat I like about the Gigabyte:\n• OLED (supposedly better image?)\n• Higher refresh rate\n• Lower latency\n\nWhat I like about the Samsung:\n• Curved display\n• Larger\n• Less expensive\n\nMy concerns:\n• I’ve heard of issues with the Samsung, but it sounds like a firmware update and some settings adjustments can fix the VRR flicker and scan line images that people have complained about.\n• I really do prefer curved monitors, but Rtings.com has the Gigabyte monitor as one of their best, and with it only being $200 more, this feels like a no-brainer for most people.\n\nDoes anyone have any firsthand experience with either of these monitors that can chime in? Or, if anyone has any other recommendations, I’m open to that too. The only things that I’m strongly against are the ultra-wide monitors. A friend of mine has an ultra-wide Alienware and I did not like gaming in that when he let me try it (much to his disbelief 😂). Trying to keep the price less than $1k for the monitor, so please bear that in mind if you’re going to make a monitor suggestion.\n\nThanks, peeps! 😁",

    "selftext": "I was first drugged into using IEMs by a friend — that’s how it all started. I began with budget models like the Tangzu Wan’er, then moved up to the Truthear Hexa and Kefine Delci. I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

After 4–5 years of use, the battery isn’t as strong, and I’ve had to replace the pads twice. The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

    "selftext": "I'm potentially in the market for my first pair of earbuds and I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could help with. I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I was first drugged into using IEMs by a friend — that’s how it all started. I began with budget models like the Tangzu Wan’er, then moved up to the Truthear Hexa and Kefine Delci. I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "title": "Lets cut through the noise about the DT 880/990 600 ohm",
    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I was first drugged into using IEMs by a friend — that’s how it all started. I began with budget models like the Tangzu Wan’er, then moved up to the Truthear Hexa and Kefine Delci. I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws.

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

I didn't initially have a case for it, so keeping it in a bag wore out it's padding and later i went ahead and bought new pads and a case for it.\n\nThe sound quality was good but since i didn't have earbuds i just used this everywhere, and one day recently its inner wire connecting the right speaker to the headband was coming out loose. I wasn't really tampering with any part of it, but just keeping the speakers rotated flat in the case (required given that it's not the biggest case) which must have resulted in the plastic joint breaking off. Soon it just came off really loose and ended in the right speaker separating\n\nThis really has me distrusting plastic headphones, so i'm not gonna take those anymore. I'm also going to go for a headphones for indoor use mainly instead of outdoors and i'm not sure if wired would be necessary\n\nWell TL;DR my main thing is I'd like some really well priced non plastic headphones that particularly help with producing music, or just general mixing nothing too special",

I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

Won't recognize touch, or in controller settings. \n\nI only dropped the deck once, with a JSAUX modcase on it, from a couple feet. It was pretty babied. I think it may have happened after an OTA software update? I don't use the left pad much thankfully, so I didn't notice it right away. I have disassembled the deck before, and the ribbon cables look good, the daughterboards look good, I don't see any corrosion, water damage, or shorting. All the connectors are snug. I tried the \"load into bios\" trick as well with no luck.\n\nOnly thing I can think of is to try a factory reset, or a re-flash/flash a previous or beta nightly OS version. I contacted Valve, but they said they only handle hardware support, & since mine is out of warranty it'd be $125-175 to look at it. The other kick in the balls is they haven't released the OLED F7G model trackpads for parts sale, just the old LCD versions, which of course are different. I can't even find them on eBay either, so I can't just swap the stupid thing like I want to. \n\nAnyone have a dead trackpad on their OLED, & figure out a trick to fix it? Any help/advice is welcome.

It only has frame dips primarily when first loading a park, and when putting down buildings, particularly large buildings. But in no way did it hinder my experience. Controls very well, though a little clunky making custom buildings. \n\nThe game itself:\n\nI'm confused because this has to be the least buggy Frontier launch I've ever played. It is for the most part solid with some minor bugs. The game itself is absolutely amazing and imo the new best in the series for the Jurassic World Evolution games. The customization is top notch, and as always you can build a family friendly T Rex exhibit. Overall 9 out of 10 for me I recommend it. ",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been rethinking my charging setup lately. All my old chargers are capped at 15W and since I’ve got both a steam deck and a new S24 ultra, I figured it’s time to actually get something decent.\n\n\n\nThe confusing part is how much power do I actually need?\n\n\n\n\\- The deck’s spec says 45W USB-C PD 3.0, though in practice I hear it rarely pulls more than 40W. But anything under 38W is known to cause hiccups (restarting charge cycles).\n\n\\- My phone advertises super fast charging 45W but reviewers say it’s only a tiny bit faster than 25W in real life.\n\n\n\nSo now I am wondering if a compact 45W power bank is the smarter choice, something that can handle both my deck and my phone. I’ve been eyeing the INIU P50-E1 which is a 10,000mAh pocket sized bank that actually pushes 45W PD.\n\n\n\nHas anyone here tested 45W power banks with the deck? Does it perform the same as the stock charger or is it overkill compared to a 25W one?\n\n",

Now I'm facing a hardware issue, that I don't know how to deal with.\n\nI had played for a while, then switched to standby, connected the device to the charger, and saw the white LED light up. However, after 10 minutes I noticed that the LED was off.\n\nHere are the raw symptoms/facts:\n\n* The Steam Deck does not respond to pressing the power button at all (no beeps, no lights, nothing).\n* The charging LED does not light up when any charger is connected (including the original Steam Deck PSU).\n* This is an unmodified Steam Deck, running the original (and up-to-date) Steam OS from the Beta channel.\n* It has worked fine up until this weekend, I turned it into standby at a 19% battery level.\n\nThis is what I have tried so far:\n\n* Visually inspected the USB-C port - no indications of damage or blockage inside\n* Gently wiggle the connector to see if there's any loose contact - no LED or any other signs of life\n* The original Steam Deck charger works fine on my phone (reporting \"fast charging\")\n* Tested with different wall outlets and USB-C chargers, no difference\n* An USB-C charging analyser reports 0 Watt being drawn\n* Long press power button (up to 30 seconds) - no sign of life\n* I have removed the Steam Deck's backplate for a visual inspection of loose wires or faulty components inside - nothing visible from the back, but the charging port was a level deeper than I could access\n\nMy preliminary diagnosis is that there is an electronics defect inside the device, somewhere between the USB-C charging port and the battery. As a software developer, hardware issues are the most frustrating to deal with, and I'd hate losing my Steam Deck due to a single broken €2 capacitor...\n\nPerhaps I'm only looking to share my sadness, but let me ask these questions:\n\nHas anyone ever had a similar experience? Or a different diagnosis based on the above? Or any advice on how to get it diagnosed/fixed?",

    "selftext": "Hiya all, just wanted to post here to see if I could get some help and see if other folks have been experiencing this recently. My Deck has stopped connecting to WiFi, any WiFi service at all even after resetting my own modem and trying other connections outside of my household and will only connect via ethernet or hotspot off my iPhone.\n\nMy deck is a non-OLED model purchased before OLED was available and it's been working fine in general without many issues. The current update is one from I think around 2 weeks ago. I know earlier this year with an update - I think it was around May this year - there was a bit of a widespread WiFi connection issue that was caused by said update and I ended up using the solution most people here suggested at that time which was going into the developer settings and enabling \"Force WPA Supplicant Wi-Fi backend\" and that sorted out my issue at the time like it did for other folks. This time however when I go into developer settings that option is nowhere to be found under the WiFi section or anywhere else. The only option I have is to turn on/off the WiFi Power Management and even adjusting that setting - trying it both on and off - hasn't done anything to help.\n\nA new issue with the WiFi not connecting is also my Deck essentially gets stuck on the connecting pop-up menu, never actually connecting and after pressing cancel the buttons on my deck no longer work. Anything I press does nothing and I can only navigate the Deck using touchscreen until I force restart the Deck, as doing it normally from the menu just makes it get stuck shutting down but doesn't actually shut down, and the buttons start working again. All of this makes me think it's a bit of a bug going on so I'm just unsure if folks have found solutions for it or if others have experienced it as well as googling is largely bringing up posts from the May WiFi issues and not many super recent with the same specific similarities that I'm having.\n\nGoing to desktop mode and trying to connect to WiFi has also been unsuccessful as well :(",

    "selftext": "So second attempt at dealing with my pain, firstly they wanted me just to go down the pain pathway, which would be finding medication that reduces the pain, but it only ever \"reduces\" it, and never to a point where I feel able to get up and out of bed, so after pushing the docs and collapsing a lot like last night, we have decided to remove some of my lower bowel. \n\nMentally I'm done. I feel like I cannot physically make it, I cannot push through the pain, if I could end it tomorrow I would because I don't see anything worth fighting for, I just feel done. \n\nSo once again, I thank you all for your help, your attention, your support. The reason I fight on is for my family, but it's always for the family I've made here, but as I say, it's becoming too hard. \n\nAdd me on steam, I don't know how often, or whether I will be on, but I will try - 82871772\n\nI am on my discord a little more, you can find me there but again, none of you had to do anything, it's just been nice having you all around. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/X54M525Nq\n\nBeing stuck in bed the past few weeks means, wanting to play games my steam deck either can't or doesn't play well. \n\nSTREAMING! It's honestly such a way forward, wether it's Xbox cloud, moonlight or or Nvidia (I use Nvidia Ge Force and Xbox Cloud) \n\nIt delivers well, I get to play BF6 at 60fps on my deck or Silent Hill F, games with the anti cheat I can now play, it's super helpful. \n\nA little review :\n\nHalloween is my favourite time of year, my second behind Christmas.\n\nRavenous Devils - Heard of Sweeny Todd? Well it's basically that, you manage a Victorian pie shop downstairs and tailor upstairs. It's pretty much a simple click and do this, people come to see the tailor, you kill them drop them down to your wife who grinds the up and makes pies and Steaks. \n\nYou make money, make your system and equipment better and don't get caught! It's fun! \n\nI love games where YOU are the villain. And for 3.99 it's a solid great game that I had never come across before! \n\nThe Drifter - A point and click adventure I came along, you're a \"Drifter\" a homeless guy, an Aussie in Australia dealing with homeless people going missing in the night. \n\nIt's nothing new regarding the mechanics, but simply the story and VOICE ACTING it's phenomenal and again, whilst being cheap, it's scary in a real life kind of way. It's perfect for the deck and just great for when moving a few fingers is the least painful thing to do! \n\nThanks for reading (Apologises for the depressing part) \n\nLove you all. \n\nM\n\n\n P.S. Drop me message on here if you want to talk to ask anything! ",

Eventually, I really liked the Xbox 360 controller, and I could play well enough. Now I understand that the Steam Deck can cause cramps in some people's hands during long gaming sessions, and I was wondering about your experiences with this. As I live in Europe and their is not really a placee to try out a deck in a store to feel how its configuration works for my hands.   \n  \nAny advice on this?? thank you!  ",

I looked up fixes and nothing seems to work. I put 7 hours into this game doing all the tedious side stuff and whatnot in order to get all the items, I really, REALLY do not want go through all that again. Can anyone help please?",

My cousin will be returning from the US and I was considering getting one through them but you apparently need a steam account(with purchases of that region) to buy one (but mine isn’t of the US) or you can use a guest option? However I saw some posts that suggested that you don’t get any order tracking for a few days? How reliable is Valve in shipping & delivery? I won’t have to worry about any mishaps there right?\n\nAnd since I won’t have warranty, how reliable are these devices?\n\nSomeone please answer as the alternative is a Switch 2 and that is extremely costly and I’m afraid of that drifting.",

After reboot it asks me to login, strange again so I login and my entire OS has wiped itself. What the hell?\n\nSo for context. I set up a dual boot with windows 11. I use windows 11 for VR. I need to know what could’ve even caused this?\n\nLast time I used it I shut steam OS down properly, I booted into windows 11 using my boot manager and shut windows 11 down. I’ve heard things that windows update can attempt to overwrite other partitions on your drive which can corrupt steamOS and trigger a reset. I’m not sure if that was my issue though, funnily enough windows 11 is still working fine. In fact it sometimes directly boots into it and ignores the boot screen, not all the time though.\n\nSo is this a windows 11 thing? If it is then it’s completely unacceptable from Microsoft and makes the OS unusable. I’m just annoyed I’ll now have to boot into recovery and sort the partitions out again. Has anyone experienced this issue? It’s been working fine for a good week or so.\n\nAlso side note, can I recover deleted files in steamOS? I know you can do it on windows using recuvra and such. I was playing dark souls 2 before the steamOS reset and it doesn’t support steam cloud.\nCan I retrieve these save files? I’m not using the OS at the moment incase I overwrite those deleted files.",

No Windows, no streaming — pure Deck magic.",

    "selftext": "Just got a steam deck. Bought Horizon Zero Dawn. Started the game and couldn’t figure out how to get to the in-game menu to see the map. Finally figured out it wasn’t assigned to any button(??). So I assigned it to the ‘select’ (square inside square) button. That works. But when I use that button to open the menu (inventory, skill tree progress, map, ect,) - about 80% of the time, all the buttons go dead and I can’t navigate the menu, or even exit out. So then I have to hit the ‘steam button’, then close, at which point all the buttons in the menu work suddenly and I can navigate navigate the menu.\n\nHaving to do this constantly is super annoying. Any fix? Am I missing something? TIA ",

    "selftext": "Issue: Battery stuck at 0 and isnt charging at all. Unplugging just shuts down the deck (LCD) immediately so I can’t recalibrate thru letting it die in BIOS.\n\nHad to replace the og battery because it was already in its “spicy” phase. Ordered a Getac one and replaced it. \n\nThings I’ve done: \n1. Upon removing the og battery, I tried running the deck thru the charger. Charger plugged, no battery. Tested some light games Ni No Kuni 2 and some Emulation with Unicorn Overlord. With the charger plugged, it would power down especially when game gets heavy or theres too much going on. This happened around 5-10 times. Then I limited the TDP to 10 and the shut downs stopped. (Again this is with charger plugged ONLY and no battery) \n\n2. When I received the new battery, immediately hooked it up and booted the deck. 37% and CHARGING but the battery had a “h? m?” So i figured I needed to calibrate it. Had it drained fully but then it never came up again. I think I messed up by letting it drain down to 0.\n\n3. Tried removing the battery pin, let it sit a while and reconnect it. \n\n4. Tried leaving it on charge both ON and OFF on separate days and even charged it while pn desktop mode. \n\n5. Followed the battery storage mode instructions and even the “minus volume button + “…” + “Power”. Basically almost all the previous posts in the thread. ;(\n\n6. Tried different chargers, both 65w and lower.  \n-used the og charger eversince. Og Charger can charge other devices without issues soI doubt its the problem. \n\nQuestions: \n1. Idk if 5.90 V (2nd pic) is normal but from what I’ve seen from other screenshots, it seems the voltage is too low? Is this normal? \n\n2. Is there a tool/device that electronic repair shops could tell which has an issue? Like can they check if my type c port is faulty or is it the battery?\n\nCan't reach out to Valve for repair since I'm in SEAsia and the deck (LCD) was bought in 2023.",

    "selftext": "So second attempt at dealing with my pain, firstly they wanted me just to go down the pain pathway, which would be finding medication that reduces the pain, but it only ever \"reduces\" it, and never to a point where I feel able to get up and out of bed, so after pushing the docs and collapsing a lot like last night, we have decided to remove some of my lower bowel. \n\nMentally I'm done. I feel like I cannot physically make it, I cannot push through the pain, if I could end it tomorrow I would because I don't see anything worth fighting for, I just feel done. \n\nSo once again, I thank you all for your help, your attention, your support. The reason I fight on is for my family, but it's always for the family I've made here, but as I say, it's becoming too hard. \n\nAdd me on steam, I don't know how often, or whether I will be on, but I will try - 82871772\n\nI am on my discord a little more, you can find me there but again, none of you had to do anything, it's just been nice having you all around. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/X54M525Nq\n\nBeing stuck in bed the past few weeks means, wanting to play games my steam deck either can't or doesn't play well. \n\nSTREAMING! It's honestly such a way forward, wether it's Xbox cloud, moonlight or or Nvidia (I use Nvidia Ge Force and Xbox Cloud) \n\nIt delivers well, I get to play BF6 at 60fps on my deck or Silent Hill F, games with the anti cheat I can now play, it's super helpful. \n\nA little review :\n\nHalloween is my favourite time of year, my second behind Christmas.\n\nRavenous Devils - Heard of Sweeny Todd? Well it's basically that, you manage a Victorian pie shop downstairs and tailor upstairs. It's pretty much a simple click and do this, people come to see the tailor, you kill them drop them down to your wife who grinds the up and makes pies and Steaks. \n\nYou make money, make your system and equipment better and don't get caught! It's fun! \n\nI love games where YOU are the villain. And for 3.99 it's a solid great game that I had never come across before! \n\nThe Drifter - A point and click adventure I came along, you're a \"Drifter\" a homeless guy, an Aussie in Australia dealing with homeless people going missing in the night. \n\nIt's nothing new regarding the mechanics, but simply the story and VOICE ACTING it's phenomenal and again, whilst being cheap, it's scary in a real life kind of way. It's perfect for the deck and just great for when moving a few fingers is the least painful thing to do! \n\nThanks for reading (Apologises for the depressing part) \n\nLove you all. \n\nM\n\n\n P.S. Drop me message on here if you want to talk to ask anything! ",

It only has frame dips primarily when first loading a park, and when putting down buildings, particularly large buildings. But in no way did it hinder my experience. Controls very well, though a little clunky making custom buildings. \n\nThe game itself:\n\nI'm confused because this has to be the least buggy Frontier launch I've ever played. It is for the most part solid with some minor bugs. The game itself is absolutely amazing and imo the new best in the series for the Jurassic World Evolution games. The customization is top notch, and as always you can build a family friendly T Rex exhibit. Overall 9 out of 10 for me I recommend it. ",

But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale.

Super crisp and fluid. But.... it has some stuttering and hiccups. I eventually reduced it to 120 Hz and it seemed more stable.\n\nFor those of you that use the Deck in a dock, as a desktop, what was the sweet spot for you in terms of resolution and refresh rate, for it to behave nicely?\n\nEDIT: not going to try and play at 1440p, guys, just to use it as desktop for browsing, office work, etc.",

In this video, I show you how to bring Adobe Flash games back to life right on your Steam Deck using EmuDeck and EmulationStation-DE (ES-DE). From Newgrounds classics to those weird little gems you wasted hours on back in the 2000s— they all live again.  \n  \nI’ll walk you through everything you need to get Ruffle, EmuDeck, and ES-DE playing nice together, plus show off some working examples running natively on Deck. No Windows, no streaming — pure Deck magic.",

Won't recognize touch, or in controller settings. \n\nI only dropped the deck once, with a JSAUX modcase on it, from a couple feet. It was pretty babied. I think it may have happened after an OTA software update? I don't use the left pad much thankfully, so I didn't notice it right away. I have disassembled the deck before, and the ribbon cables look good, the daughterboards look good, I don't see any corrosion, water damage, or shorting. All the connectors are snug. I tried the \"load into bios\" trick as well with no luck.\n\nOnly thing I can think of is to try a factory reset, or a re-flash/flash a previous or beta nightly OS version. I contacted Valve, but they said they only handle hardware support, & since mine is out of warranty it'd be $125-175 to look at it. The other kick in the balls is they haven't released the OLED F7G model trackpads for parts sale, just the old LCD versions, which of course are different. I can't even find them on eBay either, so I can't just swap the stupid thing like I want to. \n\nAnyone have a dead trackpad on their OLED, & figure out a trick to fix it? Any help/advice is welcome.

    "selftext": "So I’ve been rethinking my charging setup lately. All my old chargers are capped at 15W and since I’ve got both a steam deck and a new S24 ultra, I figured it’s time to actually get something decent.\n\n\n\nThe confusing part is how much power do I actually need?\n\n\n\n\\- The deck’s spec says 45W USB-C PD 3.0, though in practice I hear it rarely pulls more than 40W. But anything under 38W is known to cause hiccups (restarting charge cycles).\n\n\\- My phone advertises super fast charging 45W but reviewers say it’s only a tiny bit faster than 25W in real life.\n\n\n\nSo now I am wondering if a compact 45W power bank is the smarter choice, something that can handle both my deck and my phone. I’ve been eyeing the INIU P50-E1 which is a 10,000mAh pocket sized bank that actually pushes 45W PD.\n\n\n\nHas anyone here tested 45W power banks with the deck? Does it perform the same as the stock charger or is it overkill compared to a 25W one?\n\n",

I feel like I cannot physically make it, I cannot push through the pain, if I could end it tomorrow I would because I don't see anything worth fighting for, I just feel done. \n\nSo once again, I thank you all for your help, your attention, your support. The reason I fight on is for my family, but it's always for the family I've made here, but as I say, it's becoming too hard. \n\nAdd me on steam, I don't know how often, or whether I will be on, but I will try - 82871772\n\nI am on my discord a little more, you can find me there but again, none of you had to do anything, it's just been nice having you all around. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/X54M525Nq\n\nBeing stuck in bed the past few weeks means, wanting to play games my steam deck either can't or doesn't play well. \n\nSTREAMING! It's honestly such a way forward, wether it's Xbox cloud, moonlight or or Nvidia (I use Nvidia Ge Force and Xbox Cloud) \n\nIt delivers well, I get to play BF6 at 60fps on my deck or Silent Hill F, games with the anti cheat I can now play, it's super helpful. \n\nA little review :\n\nHalloween is my favourite time of year, my second behind Christmas.\n\nRavenous Devils - Heard of Sweeny Todd? Well it's basically that, you manage a Victorian pie shop downstairs and tailor upstairs. It's pretty much a simple click and do this, people come to see the tailor, you kill them drop them down to your wife who grinds the up and makes pies and Steaks. \n\nYou make money, make your system and equipment better and don't get caught! It's fun! \n\nI love games where YOU are the villain. And for 3.99 it's a solid great game that I had never come across before! \n\nThe Drifter - A point and click adventure I came along, you're a \"Drifter\" a homeless guy, an Aussie in Australia dealing with homeless people going missing in the night. \n\nIt's nothing new regarding the mechanics, but simply the story and VOICE ACTING it's phenomenal and again, whilst being cheap, it's scary in a real life kind of way. It's perfect for the deck and just great for when moving a few fingers is the least painful thing to do! \n\nThanks for reading (Apologises for the depressing part) \n\nLove you all. \n\nM\n\n\n P.S. Drop me message on here if you want to talk to ask anything! ",

It only has frame dips primarily when first loading a park, and when putting down buildings, particularly large buildings. But in no way did it hinder my experience. Controls very well, though a little clunky making custom buildings. \n\nThe game itself:\n\nI'm confused because this has to be the least buggy Frontier launch I've ever played. It is for the most part solid with some minor bugs. The game itself is absolutely amazing and imo the new best in the series for the Jurassic World Evolution games.

However, they also sent it back with someone else's case on it, and a scuffed shoulder button (I presume it occurred while applying the case).\n\nI sent it back to them once more, requesting the case be removed and the shoulder button replaced. I've just received it back, and they did both things. Heck, they even included a brand new charger in the box. Not bad! \n\nExcept, after holding the Deck for a couple minutes, I noticed a distinct lack of orange.\n\nThe thumbsticks. They had been swapped for standard OLED thumbsticks.\n\nI have no clue WHY this is. There were no issues with my thumbsticks before. We never discussed swapping them. And they swapped them for the normal version on a limited edition console.\n\nAbsolutely insane. I've never had this much issue with a repair service before. I will now be sending my unit in for a THIRD TIME because they keep sending it back to me with new damage.\n\nThird picture is for reference from the Valve video for what they're supposed to look like.\n\nAnd before people ask again: yes, this Deck has the same S/N as the one I sent in the last two times.",

I think it may have happened after an OTA software update? I don't use the left pad much thankfully, so I didn't notice it right away. I have disassembled the deck before, and the ribbon cables look good, the daughterboards look good, I don't see any corrosion, water damage, or shorting. All the connectors are snug. I tried the \"load into bios\" trick as well with no luck.\n\nOnly thing I can think of is to try a factory reset, or a re-flash/flash a previous or beta nightly OS version. I contacted Valve, but they said they only handle hardware support, & since mine is out of warranty it'd be $125-175 to look at it. The other kick in the balls is they haven't released the OLED F7G model trackpads for parts sale, just the old LCD versions, which of course are different. I can't even find them on eBay either, so I can't just swap the stupid thing like I want to. \n\nAnyone have a dead trackpad on their OLED, & figure out a trick to fix it? Any help/advice is welcome.

(and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

    "title": "Deciding between Aqara and Schlage smart door locks",
    "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking to add some automation to my home for the very first time. I am looking to start by purchasing a smart lock for my front door. I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "Christmas post… thinking about it already! I’m looking for a compact smart plug that sits between an outlet and a device. When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I would like to find a smart outlet that will dim on/off the lights over the course of anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. I dont really care what the time increment is. I just wanna be able to set it to dim on at x time and dim off at x time. I have cruised youtube and the google and have not found what I'm lookin for yet, i dont think. So i figured id come to the ole reddit and see if what I'm looking for even exists and if anyone has specific products they would suggest. ",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

So I know my setup works in general, but this specific bulb just won't connect.\nThe bulb powers on fine and goes into pairing mode (blinking), but it times out every single time at the network connection step.\nHas anyone else dealt with this timeout error on the Essential model specifically? Any ideas why one bulb would work fine but the other won't? Thanks in advance for any help!",

If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

We have Schlage Z-Wave locks on a Vera hub and use a property management system (PMS) for bookings.\n\n**Goal:** Auto-add 4-digit PIN (last 4 of guest's phone) to room lock on arrival day after payment. Delete it at checkout time.\n\n**Setup:** Locks enrolled (basic lock/unlock works). Our PMS has webhooks for triggers.\n\nIs this possible with Vera and Z-Wave? Anyone done similar setups (PMS + Z-Wave auto-PINs)?\n\n**Ask:**\n\n* Freelance dev able to code the Z-Wave/Vera bridge?\n\nThanks",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

    "selftext": "My parents have a lovely little property with a garden and a few acres of land. It’s their pride and joy... they take care of it all themselves, from flower beds to chickens.\n\nBut lately I’ve noticed it’s becoming harder for them to keep track of everything.... Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar? Any recommendations for brands or setups that don’t need heavy installation or complicated apps?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a project where I need to take gas pressure readings from four different locations and record them at intervals of 2-5 seconds.\n\nI initially looked for gas pressure transmitters and data loggers that can handle 4-20 mA signals, but I couldn't find a suitable one locally. Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a project where I need to take gas pressure readings from four different locations and record them at intervals of 2-5 seconds.\n\nI initially looked for gas pressure transmitters and data loggers that can handle 4-20 mA signals, but I couldn't find a suitable one locally. Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

It's a house with its own Boiler and heated through Fernwärme (sorry, not sure the proper English term for this, maybe district heating?).\n\nAnyways, my plan is not touch the boiler itself, but the thermostats in each room, so I can control them automatically through my phone or have automations on Home Assistant.\nAttached is a picture of the current thermostat I have in each room.\n\nWould you have some experience with a similar setup? What could work here?\n\nThanks in advance ",

    "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking to add some automation to my home for the very first time. I am looking to start by purchasing a smart lock for my front door. I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

So i figured id come to the ole reddit and see if what I'm looking for even exists and if anyone has specific products they would suggest. ",

The added features I'm looking for are\n\n1) Pullout function to open automatically either with sensor or with opening the cabinet (ideally the former)  \n2) Touchless trash can lid  \n3) No drilling into cabinet required preferred\n\nThank you all in advance for any recommendations!

If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

Since it would be too expensive for me to replace all the switches with smart ones (especially because I have the same problem in other parts of the apartment), and since it’s also not possible for me to replace the ceiling spots themselves, I’m looking for a way to integrate them into my Home Assistant system.\n\nThe light switches are configured in a multi-way (intermediate) circuit.\n\nDoes it make sense — or is it even possible — to replace only one of the switches in this setup, or would that not work? Are there any other options I might not have considered?\n\nI hope everything is understandable :D I am not a native speaker.\n\nThank you in advance guys!\n\n  \nEDIT1: I it is a Intermediate switching/4-way switch circuit",

It has physical stop settings, so the risk of overtravel is limited as long as those don't fail, but the motor switch is 3-position.\n\nIt's not 3-way: it's 3-position, that is, the up position goes clockwise, down goes counter-clockwise, and there's a middle neutral position that is off. A switch like that would have to have a very specific \"on\" time. Like, I should be able to tell it how long it takes to extend fully and program that time in seconds.\n\n  \nIs there any product that works well and integrates with the typical smart home hubs that would work? Right now, we have and really like Hue hub for our exterior lights and a way to hook this up to Hue would be awesome. What I'd like to avoid is another Wi-Fi-based switch with a proprietary app. I am pretty handy, but a plug-and-play switch is really all I'm willing to invest in for this project.",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is.

    "title": "Nest thermostat seems to not learn at all?",
    "selftext": "I have a Nest thermostat in my apartment building- and have the “Auto-Schedule” feature on.\n\nPer the app description, “Auto-Schedule learns your behavior as you adjust your thermostat and automatically creates a schedule to match your heating and cooling preferences.”\n\nHowever, my Nest does not seem to be adjusting properly. I like to sleep with the temperature around 74-75, but during the day I keep it a few degrees warmer, closer to 77. Every single night I have to change the thermostat manually to be set around 75, and then I have to do the same thing every morning. It has been months and I am starting to get frustrated. Last night the temperature adjusted from 75 to 77 while I was sleeping and I woke up in the middle of the night. That would be the opposite scheduling of what I want, and I’m starting to get incredibly frustrated.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar issues, and how could I correct it?",

(Some things are more comokicated but with enough time i can handle it) So i would love to have the visualisation over HA. \n\nBUT; What would be the best/easiest way to set up the rest/electricity? This should be more of an easy/straight forward thing. Should run when we move into the house. I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all.

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I’m considering buying a new one.  \n*To add, the event log also shows messages like “the device is not accessible” and “device could not be migrated.”*",

Trying to figure this issue I am having out is near impossible for me, so I'm asking for some real help here. Long story short, I use Cox as they're the only one who will service where I live. I have three WIFI networks I can connect to, two of which are 5 gigahertz and one is a 2.4. According to my router logs, I am getting a \"fraggle attack\" every 10 minutes on the dot, and it shuts down both fast networks every time it happens. The 2.4GHz network it the only one not being messed with, as far as I can tell because it's the only one that does not constantly shut down. These attacks are 99% from one private IP, though there has been one other in the past I have not seen in a while. I have had a friend who works in cybersecurity for Walmart try and fix it on multiple occasions and it has not helped. Cox's abuse department is as useful as a wet sock, and I'm stuck paying $110/month for 10gb/s internet because I can only use the slower network. I can provide whatever info y'all need, but I'm tired of doing this. It's been happening for well over a year now and I am just now realizing how hard I'm getting screwed. I've resorted to asking ChatGPT how to fix it and I'm completely out of my league on this one. Please Help!",

They claimed it was deleted a few weeks ago when I was under review for a social media posts I made and someone reported it anonymously. That issue was closed out with a warning and my boss thought the whole thing was stupid since I’m a great employee.\n\nAfter HR told me why my computer was locked out, they went radio silent and the next day it was nearing the end of Friday with no word or response back yet. I assumed they were just going to fire me, but I made the decision to resign instead. I already had another job lined up from when they were reviewing my social media.\n\nAnyways, I’ve had multiple coworkers calling me and asking me what happened. I told them what happened and they said it sounded suspicious that IT would point the finger at me for a program we all assumed would be impossible to remove.\n\nLayer that night (in a group text), two of my former coworkers said they searched the computers for this program and could not find it anywhere. \n\nMy question: How was it possible for me to remove it? Could I have done it somehow without knowing I did? I worked at a large data center company so it seems unlikely and more like they just wanted to fire me.",

    "selftext": "I am not an IT professional, but have enough basic understanding of how our home network works to know when the system is down. Currently, our internet through Astound isn't working. The router shows that there isn't internet and my devices all say the same after reboot. I AM able to renew our IP address.\n\nOur Vizio TV says no network is detected and the home screen and other apps are unable to connect. NETFLIX miraculously works. Search, ads and streaming all works, so i have ruled out it being stored in cache. Looking at my tv status shows no wifi network connection, so there isn't any visible connection to my neighbors Comcast Internet. \n\nWhat's going on?\n",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My PC was running Windows perfectly fine.\n* At some point, the Windows setup started crashing, the AntiviriusKaspersky start crashing, not oppening, having error (random reboots), the msi center app was not working also, even though everything worked before.\nI decided to do a clean installation from USB, fully wiping the SSD.\n\nSince then:\nSetup consistently crashes during Windows installation:\n\n-Either while loading the setup,\n\n-Or at the language selection screen,\n\n-Or at the product key entry screen. \n\nThen Black screen, then reboot. Then it start again, and again. And if i unplug the usb and try to start on the ssd, it goes directly in bios uefi.\n\nNo error code, no BSOD.

Also, it’s not a gaming server problem, my computer completely loses Internet, I use an ethernet connection and AT&T fiber which gets really good speeds up to 999 MB per second. The interesting thing is that no other connection goes at my house during my disconnection. So my son can be on his PS five or on his iPad and he sees no interruption. I’ve tried a few things that I read on the Internet, such as updating the bios, double checking that my driver for the ethernet port is up-to-date, I’ve also unchecked the power management option to turn off ethernet if there’s too much power needed. Other than that I’m lost. I don’t think it’s the cable since it works 99% of the time. Not sure if there’s anything else I can do. But it really only happens when I start off escape from Tark off.",

    "title": "Weird artifacts, after installing gpu",
    "selftext": "I have just finished my first pc build, but am very confused. I got a refurbished GPU off eBay (a radeon 5600 xt).It ran fine at first, tested it in a game of Helldivers, stable frame and no issues. I then turned it off and left it for a few hours. When I turned it back on there was no immediate issue. I decided to run furmark again no issues (got around 7000), but then after a few minutes it black screen, I had Spotify running and sound still played. I restarted and it seemed fine but again, after 10 or so minutes, it black screened after showing some weird diagonal pink squares. This continued for 5 or so restarts, untill the main problem occured it stared up with these vertical lines. Around 15 evenly spaced across the screen, each with a width of 4ish cm, and consisting of many small horizontal lines that change between white and pink.I haven't got it to crash yet, but no matter how many restarts I do It doesn't go away. When I return to my cpus integrated graphics it fine, so it must be something with the GPU. I tried taking screenshots of it but the artifacts don't show up in the picture, which makes me think it's not initially a hardware issue. Also for context I am running Linux mint\n\ni really don't understand what's going on, and would greatly appreciate some help, thank you\n",

Last year I got new USB drives that I encrypted on my work laptop, and it would let me access the files directly in Windows Explorer (after inputting my USB password). \n\nLast month I got a new work laptop, but now I can only access the encrypted USB drive through the Trellix application (i.e., I have to click on 'MfeEERM.exe' and have to add/remove files within the application). To be clear, I always had to do this on computers that weren't my work laptop before, but now I have to do it on the laptop as well. \n\nI find that file transfer is MUCH slower than what it was through Explorer, and I was wondering if there was a way (like a certificate or something?) that I could enable this again on the new laptop, or if the only way was to reformat the drive and re-encrypt it. I tried looking online but couldn't find much since most of the hits weren't relevant. Unfortunately, I don't have admin access so I suspect there's nothing I can do outside of formatting.",

Is this normal or something I should be worried about. I wish I could describe better what it sounds like, but it happened about two hours ago.\n\nEdit: I am in class taking notes, and it happened again! I didn't think I did anything, but I tried shaking it lightly and it made the noise a few more times. Now it isn't doing it again, but I have no idea what's going on. Can someone please help me?",

    "selftext": "So I have a OnePlus Nord N30 5G if anyone knows what that is. What's happening is the screen has stopped rotating but not exactly. I have the auto-rotate feature on and the screen will still rotate, like for example when I go full screen in YouTube. The problem is that I can't get the screen to rotate. For example it will not rotate in the photo app, a better example is, I have a mobile game that requires you to tilt the phone, and the game is not responding to my tilting the phone. Does anyone know what this could be or have any suggestions on what to do?",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,  \n\nI’m having an issue with my SSD performance on Windows 11. According to CrystalDiskInfo the drive health is “Good”, and there is plenty of free space available. The SSD is connected to my PC with the small SATA cable that came with the computer.  \n\nThe problem is that the speeds are extremely slow, especially for write operations. Even in CrystalDiskMark tests, the read speeds look fine (around 500 MB/s), but the write speeds are much lower than expected (sometimes dropping to 20–30 MB/s, occasionally up to ~300 MB/s). In Task Manager, the disk usage often shows 100% even though the actual throughput is very low.  \n\nSo far I’ve:  \n- Verified the drive health (SMART = Good)  \n- Made sure there is enough free space  \n- Tried disabling antivirus temporarily  \n- Tested with CrystalDiskMark  \n\nBut the write speeds are still far below what a normal SATA SSD should deliver.  \n\nDoes anyone know what else could cause this? Could it be the cable, the SATA port, drivers, or something else in Windows 11?  \n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

I’m using ODT to install and update (production is an offline network) and my config.XML is as follows:\n\n<Configuration>\n<Add OfficeClientEdition=“64” Channel=“PerpetualVL2024” SourcePath=“C:\\ODT”>\n<Product ID=“ProPlus2024Volume” PIDKEY=“<GVLK for 2024 LTSC>”>\n<Language ID=“en-us” />\n</Product>\n</Add>\n</Configuration>\n\nI apologize for any formatting, I’m on my cell phone. Any help would be amazing because, as I said, I’ve tried multiple times and had others try and we keep getting 19231.20216 which (from what I saw) is retail. When I run the install with ODT I get a message ProPlus2024Volume not valid, which makes sense if that’s the retail pull.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "I don't know a ton about computers disclaimer. This is a prebuilt gaming PC from Ibuypower I bought 4 years ago. It's gotten the occasional BSOD maybe a couple times a year the first couple years but in the past 2 years its definitely increase in frequency. The past year I'd say it BSOD every other month. And since the start of October it has BSOD 3 times now. It goes without saying I'm becoming very worried that my computer will suffer permanent damage if it hasn't already.\n\nI've already done the usual chkdsk and DISM command prompts, and it always says it finds a couple corrupted files and fixes them. Of course, I still am getting these blue screens. \n\nThe crashes almost always happen when I'm in the middle of a game. Lately I've been playing Battlefield 6, which is one of the more demanding games and the past 3 crashes have all been during BF6. The crashes usually shut my computer down, flashes an error message at the bottom for maybe a second, then it restarts and goes back to my desktop. Everything works fine after that. \n\nI should also mention that I have the occasional crash when I'm not even using my computer, sometimes I'll wake up and check my computer (I always leave on sleep mode) and it will have crashed overnight.\n\nThis most recent crash today I checked the Blue Screen View and the only file that that appears in all my recent crashes in the past 4 months are from ntoskrnl.exe. The previous crash I experienced 2 days ago has the bug string \"PAGE\\_FAULT\\_IN\\_NONPAGED\\_AREA\" string attached to it, and the crash from 11 days ago has the string \"MEMORY\\_MANAGEMENT\" with it. The crash from today has no bug string.\n\nPC Specs:\n\nZ690 Gigabyte motherboard, i7-12700kf intel CPU, RTX 3080 GPU, Corsair 2x8 16gb RAM, Samsung SSD Evo 970 Plus for my game storage and WD Blue SN570 for Windows and desktop files. \n\nI always make sure to leave more than 25% of storage space on both my 2TB and my 1TB SSDs to ensure long term health of the drives.\n\nBased on similar posts that I've read about, it sounds like it could be an issue with either my Ram or my CPU. But I really have no clue, and I don't know what else to do from here.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Hello all!\nSo, I’m decently familiar with things pertaining to hardware and software, but when it comes to networking I have very little to no knowledge whatsoever. Please bare with me as I try to explain the issue at hand. \n\nOk, we have an Esports Facility that is located off campus, but it uses the same isp and I’m guessing connections as the dorms that are on campus. This isp is Apogee. Here’s the issue. Some games, such as Halo Infinite and RS6 sometimes have this weird thing happen where members can not connect to ANY lobby. Discord will work, loading the internet will work, but no matter what it is impossible to join a lobby. Every PC is using ethernet connection. I have found a workaround in turning on the wifi card, connecting the pc to a hotspot, disconnecting the ethernet, turning the wifi card off, waiting for the pc to recognize there is no internet, and then reconnecting the ethernet. However, when doing this, there is a chance that a different PC will then have the same issue described above. In which case we continue the “fix” until all are able to connect to the lobby. \n\nCampus IT has been called out to fix the issue, but when they come, campus traffic as well as facility traffic isn’t as high and therefore the issue cannot be replicated. I should have mentioned that earlier, it seems to only be an issue when a lot of teams are at the facility are playing. It’s almost like the amount of traffic causes a port to be killed on the switch side. \n\nIf anyone has any advice or anything they could recommend me tell IT or if you need more answers from me please let me know.

(I discovered this by accident, but I'm wary of using this)\n\nPotentially related: sometimes it doesn't seem to go to sleep correctly either, waking itself back up after a couple minutes. However, this doesn't seem to happen often or with any consistency.\n\nI've tried looking at Windows's power settings, everything, it all \\*seems\\* like the settings should be theoretically correct - so I have no idea what's been causing this behavior.

    "selftext": "I have a Asus Z170 motherboard. My PC was working just fine yesterday. It usually beeps once shortly after pressing the power on button and the fans start spinning. This morning, I booted it up, and it went randomly into BIOS settings. I didn't change anything, clicked save and exit, and then the PC booted up normally. However about 10min later, it completely froze. I forced-shut it down using the power button on the PC. Gave it a couple of minutes, then powered it on again. After pressing the power button, I did not hear the beep. The fans starting spinning, but nothing else happened after that. Nothing came through video, and the PC essentially just was powering the fans and nothing else. What can I do to fix this? It's obviously an older PC given the MOBO, but has been working perfectly for years. I'm not great with the components so don't want to start troubleshooting myself as I'd risk making the situation worse.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated!\n\n# ",

From there I saw the client kept popping up even after removing the msi files and the active software itself so I installed Malwarebytes and that caught a few more files. However once again the SetMe software is active so I don't think I will be able to remove whatever is regenerating the software. Before I back up her files and reinstall windows is there anything else I can try? I will also provide a bulleted list of the steps I have taken so far.\n\nIssue: Phising email installed ScreenConnect Client and SetMe software.\n\n1. Ran windows defender: No threats detected\n2. Removed all msi and installed software related to phising email: Software reinstalled itself\n3. Ran malwarebytes: Removed several threats but SetMe software resinstalled\n4.

    "selftext": "Last Thursday I was locked out of my computer and immediately called on my personal cell by HR. They told me the the IT department locked me out due to a software called Proofpoint being removed on my laptop by me. They asked if I knew what it was and if I deleted it.\n\nI told them I’m not sure what it is. They explained it’s crucial for monitoring and securing my laptop. They claimed it was deleted a few weeks ago when I was under review for a social media posts I made and someone reported it anonymously. That issue was closed out with a warning and my boss thought the whole thing was stupid since I’m a great employee.\n\nAfter HR told me why my computer was locked out, they went radio silent and the next day it was nearing the end of Friday with no word or response back yet. I assumed they were just going to fire me, but I made the decision to resign instead. I already had another job lined up from when they were reviewing my social media.\n\nAnyways, I’ve had multiple coworkers calling me and asking me what happened. I told them what happened and they said it sounded suspicious that IT would point the finger at me for a program we all assumed would be impossible to remove.\n\nLayer that night (in a group text), two of my former coworkers said they searched the computers for this program and could not find it anywhere. \n\nMy question: How was it possible for me to remove it? Could I have done it somehow without knowing I did? I worked at a large data center company so it seems unlikely and more like they just wanted to fire me.",

Trying to figure this issue I am having out is near impossible for me, so I'm asking for some real help here. Long story short, I use Cox as they're the only one who will service where I live. I have three WIFI networks I can connect to, two of which are 5 gigahertz and one is a 2.4. According to my router logs, I am getting a \"fraggle attack\" every 10 minutes on the dot, and it shuts down both fast networks every time it happens. The 2.4GHz network it the only one not being messed with, as far as I can tell because it's the only one that does not constantly shut down. These attacks are 99% from one private IP, though there has been one other in the past I have not seen in a while. I have had a friend who works in cybersecurity for Walmart try and fix it on multiple occasions and it has not helped. Cox's abuse department is as useful as a wet sock, and I'm stuck paying $110/month for 10gb/s internet because I can only use the slower network. I can provide whatever info y'all need, but I'm tired of doing this. It's been happening for well over a year now and I am just now realizing how hard I'm getting screwed. I've resorted to asking ChatGPT how to fix it and I'm completely out of my league on this one. Please Help!",

I recently discovered this is tied to my **1% lows dropping significantly** during gameplay.\n\n**Some observations:**\n\n* Having **Spotify open** causes noticeably worse 1% lows.\n* Enabling **NVIDIA Instant Replay** in the overlay also worsens them.\n* I started seeing **screen tearing** around the same time these issues began.\n* When watching videos on certain sites (Sky Sports Player, BBC iPlayer, etc.), my **secondary monitor** will sometimes flicker with white lines, flash pink/green, or even briefly turn off — almost like what happens after a GPU driver update.\n\nAll of this makes me think there’s some kind of **driver scheduling, GPU timing, or another underlying issue**, but I’m not sure how to properly diagnose it.\n\nI’m looking for someone with advanced knowledge of **frametime analysis, latency tuning, or driver-level diagnostics** who might be able to help me track this down.\n\nThanks in advance — any insight or direction would be appreciated!",

Also, it’s not a gaming server problem, my computer completely loses Internet, I use an ethernet connection and AT&T fiber which gets really good speeds up to 999 MB per second. The interesting thing is that no other connection goes at my house during my disconnection. So my son can be on his PS five or on his iPad and he sees no interruption. I’ve tried a few things that I read on the Internet, such as updating the bios, double checking that my driver for the ethernet port is up-to-date, I’ve also unchecked the power management option to turn off ethernet if there’s too much power needed. Other than that I’m lost. I don’t think it’s the cable since it works 99% of the time. Not sure if there’s anything else I can do. But it really only happens when I start off escape from Tark off.",

I decided to run furmark again no issues (got around 7000), but then after a few minutes it black screen, I had Spotify running and sound still played. I restarted and it seemed fine but again, after 10 or so minutes, it black screened after showing some weird diagonal pink squares. This continued for 5 or so restarts, untill the main problem occured it stared up with these vertical lines. Around 15 evenly spaced across the screen, each with a width of 4ish cm, and consisting of many small horizontal lines that change between white and pink.I haven't got it to crash yet, but no matter how many restarts I do It doesn't go away. When I return to my cpus integrated graphics it fine, so it must be something with the GPU.

They claimed it was deleted a few weeks ago when I was under review for a social media posts I made and someone reported it anonymously. That issue was closed out with a warning and my boss thought the whole thing was stupid since I’m a great employee.\n\nAfter HR told me why my computer was locked out, they went radio silent and the next day it was nearing the end of Friday with no word or response back yet.

I already had another job lined up from when they were reviewing my social media.\n\nAnyways, I’ve had multiple coworkers calling me and asking me what happened. I told them what happened and they said it sounded suspicious that IT would point the finger at me for a program we all assumed would be impossible to remove.\n\nLayer that night (in a group text), two of my former coworkers said they searched the computers for this program and could not find it anywhere. \n\nMy question: How was it possible for me to remove it? Could I have done it somehow without knowing I did? I worked at a large data center company so it seems unlikely and more like they just wanted to fire me.",

I have three WIFI networks I can connect to, two of which are 5 gigahertz and one is a 2.4. According to my router logs, I am getting a \"fraggle attack\" every 10 minutes on the dot, and it shuts down both fast networks every time it happens. The 2.4GHz network it the only one not being messed with, as far as I can tell because it's the only one that does not constantly shut down. These attacks are 99% from one private IP, though there has been one other in the past I have not seen in a while. I have had a friend who works in cybersecurity for Walmart try and fix it on multiple occasions and it has not helped. Cox's abuse department is as useful as a wet sock, and I'm stuck paying $110/month for 10gb/s internet because I can only use the slower network. I can provide whatever info y'all need, but I'm tired of doing this. It's been happening for well over a year now and I am just now realizing how hard I'm getting screwed. I've resorted to asking ChatGPT how to fix it and I'm completely out of my league on this one. Please Help!",
