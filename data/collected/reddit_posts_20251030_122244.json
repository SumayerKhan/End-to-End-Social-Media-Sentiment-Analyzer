The system‚Äôs single-organiser structure, where one parent holds all the power, can be exploited by abusive or controlling partners, leaving the other parent and children vulnerable. This highlights the need for better policies and safeguards from tech companies to protect children in such situations.",

Brand new. Off the Apple Store App. Engraved. And it only HALF works. It can click stuff. That‚Äôs it. It will not draw. \n\nOn procreate, the eraser works, smudge and paint don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm going to take this pencil into the Apple Store and ask for one that‚Äôs actually new or a refund if they give me another busted pencil. \n\nI might as well have bought three bootleg pencils and I‚Äôd have saved money and wouldn‚Äôt have products that actually work. \n",

    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn‚Äôt an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn‚Äôt have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)!

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hello, I'm new here and I hope this is following post rules. After recent developments with the future of Android as an OS, I'm considering switching to iPhone when the time to upgrade comes. I'm already on Mac, so I guess entering the ecosystem makes sense. \n\nAs the tag specifies, I'm hoping moreso to start a discussion than just ask a question. Sure, yes. I love how open the Android OS has been. I love being in control of my files, doing whatever I want with it, and not having to deal with iOS's walled garden. I have never had an iPhone, but I did have an iPod Touch fourth generation a decade ago, and I set up my grandma's iPad for her. My experience with it is limited, but I think I get the gist.\n\nThe main reason I'm even considering this decision stems from just not needing the capabilities of a computer in my pocket as much, anymore. I realize iPhones are very solid and do what they do well. Regardless of my opinions on Apple the company, they typically seem to deliver on their products. What do you do with your iPhone, just running apps and web browsing? Do you still put your own music files on yours and sync it from the Apple Music Mac app, or do you just use the subscription? Artists, do you use yours for art, or did you shell out for an iPad and the Apple Pencil? \n\nHopefully we can just have a civil discussion without tearing down one platform or another.\n\nTLDR: I may upgrade to iPhone in the future, hoping for discussions on why you prefer your iPhone to Android, if you've used it previously.",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "Hello, I'm new here and I hope this is following post rules. After recent developments with the future of Android as an OS, I'm considering switching to iPhone when the time to upgrade comes. I'm already on Mac, so I guess entering the ecosystem makes sense. \n\nAs the tag specifies, I'm hoping moreso to start a discussion than just ask a question. Sure, yes. I love how open the Android OS has been. I love being in control of my files, doing whatever I want with it, and not having to deal with iOS's walled garden. I have never had an iPhone, but I did have an iPod Touch fourth generation a decade ago, and I set up my grandma's iPad for her. My experience with it is limited, but I think I get the gist.\n\nThe main reason I'm even considering this decision stems from just not needing the capabilities of a computer in my pocket as much, anymore. I realize iPhones are very solid and do what they do well. Regardless of my opinions on Apple the company, they typically seem to deliver on their products. What do you do with your iPhone, just running apps and web browsing? Do you still put your own music files on yours and sync it from the Apple Music Mac app, or do you just use the subscription? Artists, do you use yours for art, or did you shell out for an iPad and the Apple Pencil? \n\nHopefully we can just have a civil discussion without tearing down one platform or another.\n\nTLDR: I may upgrade to iPhone in the future, hoping for discussions on why you prefer your iPhone to Android, if you've used it previously.",

After recent developments with the future of Android as an OS, I'm considering switching to iPhone when the time to upgrade comes. I'm already on Mac, so I guess entering the ecosystem makes sense. \n\nAs the tag specifies, I'm hoping moreso to start a discussion than just ask a question. Sure, yes. I love how open the Android OS has been. I love being in control of my files, doing whatever I want with it, and not having to deal with iOS's walled garden. I have never had an iPhone, but I did have an iPod Touch fourth generation a decade ago, and I set up my grandma's iPad for her. My experience with it is limited, but I think I get the gist.\n\nThe main reason I'm even considering this decision stems from just not needing the capabilities of a computer in my pocket as much, anymore. I realize iPhones are very solid and do what they do well. Regardless of my opinions on Apple the company, they typically seem to deliver on their products. What do you do with your iPhone, just running apps and web browsing? Do you still put your own music files on yours and sync it from the Apple Music Mac app, or do you just use the subscription? Artists, do you use yours for art, or did you shell out for an iPad and the Apple Pencil? \n\nHopefully we can just have a civil discussion without tearing down one platform or another.\n\nTLDR: I may upgrade to iPhone in the future, hoping for discussions on why you prefer your iPhone to Android, if you've used it previously.",

No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt‚Äôs still in early access and I‚Äôd love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper)¬†\n\nThis is just the beginning - I‚Äôm actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles.

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

    "selftext": "you started to see some actions which knowing that google will block sideloading of non certified apps now make sense. \n\nAmazon is killing Fire OS, Fire OS is based in android 9 to 11 but they are replacing it with Vega OS on their streaming devices (which is absolte crap, its basically a OS for remote apps) and some appliances, while at the same time declaring that a new Amazon tablet will be out in 2026 with Androidn 16, meaning that that the main point of contention with Google was blocking sideloading so people could stop using their devices as general media devices instead of amazon media consumption devices.\n\nWe also had Oppo (and other BBK brands) Xiaomi and Samsung saying they would break away from the GMS ecosystem at some times, Samsung is the most advance with their accesories using Tizen instead of Android or Wear OS and having their own samsung pay service separated from Google wallet.\n\nso those details all coming togather brings us to looking it from 2 different points. \n\nAre the brands who make android based devices pressuing google to close their ecosystem and now that google has agreed we are seeing companies like Amazon allowing GMS in to their devices again (even if its just tablets).\n\nOr Google is using 3rd party vendors as an excuse to close their ecosystem, i know google  went from \"dont be evil\" to \"we are evil in person\" but i think this is a culmination of years of pressure from inside and outside google to become more like an iphone and close the system. \n\nwhats your opinion on the matter ?",

Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 ‚Üí LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B ‚Üí JN5",

    "title": "Some games aren't working on a brand new P7 Pro. + My weeklong journey with the Pixel so far.",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: Got a brand-new and (until yesterday) factory sealed Pixel 7 Pro, three games either hang or crash immediately, despite working fine on my previous Pixel. Everything else on the phone runs perfectly afaik.\n\nThis is mostly me asking for help but I've had a bit of a journey over the last week and I might ramble a little bit before I get to my actual issue. I'm a week and two devices into my journey with the Pixel 7 Pro now, easily the most expensive phone I've ever owned and huge upgrade from my old Galaxy A50.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago I bought an 'acceptable quality' refurbished Pixel 7 Pro on Amazon for ¬£210. It arrived last Wednesday and despite a slight bit of cosmetic damage and a few minor scratches on the screen that weren't even visible when the screen was on was fairly chuffed with it, I'd spent a bit of time playing around with it's camera and all the other little features that came with it, and got to setting everything up until barely 3 hours after swiching it on when it suddenly just switched itself off at around  what should've been 65%-70% battery and refused to turn back on again, only when plugged into the wall would it power on but after barely a second on the splash screen it would immediately shut off again and just keep bootlopping from there i did manage to get into the bootloader/fastboot menu but no further from there.\n\nAbout a day later it just suddenly started working again, and I'd managed (with some power button/volume spamming, I don't even remember how) to get it into some 'no command' screen and then into android itself. I had already contacted the seller yesterday to tell them it had suddenly stopped functioning so I messaged again to update them, of course my issues didn't stop there, at random points it would once again just turn off, though unlike the first time I was able to just turn it back on again. I was incredibly suspicious of the reseller anyway as they included an M360 diagnostic report that [showed 100% battery health despite their own diagnostic report showing it had been through 1050 battery cycle](https://imgur.com/a/czQaFiS)s.\n\nBy Saturday evening I'd had enough after it did it TWICE in the span of 20 minutes at work so I got home, factory wiped it and informed the seller of my intent to return it and went shopping around for another phone, I did 'really' like the Pixel 7 from the bit of time I had with it so I went around looking at the newer Pixels and on Monday I found an Ebay listing for a brand new and sealed Pixel 7 Pro for only ¬£300 so instead I dived on that. \n\n\nIt arrived yesterday and after and after confirming it was indeed brand new and factory sealed, I let it charge to full for a few hours since it was entirely dead before switching it on for the first time, spent a bit of time getting everything setup again and updating the firmware from it's factory version of Android 13 to 16, great, everything working, I'm quite happy until try to launch a couple of the games to get them setup and properly downloaded.\n\n\n\n\n**Now my ACTUAL issue.**\n\nThree of the four games I usually have installed: Old School Runescape, Nikke and Rome Total War, all of which worked on the previous refurbed Pixel refuse to work on the new one. I'm fairly certain it's not the games themselves and I don't have a clue on why it would be the phone itself. The new phone has been fully updated and as far as I'm aware were/are both on the 1st October patch that the one I returned was on.\n\nI don't generally game on mobile so the game I do play are usually just ones I play on PC anyway and have cross-progression. If only one of them was having issues I'd just brush it off but three of the four I tested is a bit more worrisome.\n\n\n**Old School Runescape:** Will either hang on a black screen when launched before popping up a 'not responding' error or it'll simply show the app icon on said black screen and nothing more.\n\n**NIKKE:** Will get to it's load screen but stop loading at step 5/7 at exactly 57% won't progress any further.\n\n**Rome Total War:** Will launch but on the screen where it requires you to acknowledge it needs a periodic internet connection to work, tapping accept will force-close/crash the game back to homescreen.\n\n\n**Umamusume** on the other hand DOES work, I was able to get that working just fine, as far as the game's lobby screen without any issues.\n\n\nAnyone having any similar issues, problems or any possible fixes? I've tried the usual troubleshooting steps, reinstalling the apps, clearing cache/data for both the games and Google Play services, rebooting the phone but zero luck so far. Short of a factory wipe and doing all the setup again I'm not entirely certain where to go from here. I did a bit of Googling and found that last months Android update *might* be causing issues for some people across multiple different Pixel models.",

I thought changing carriers might help, but it made no difference. \n\nAnyway, recently there have been two incidents where I've needed to call 000 and my phone **can't connectivity to emergency services** because of this bug. \n\nIn Australia (and I assume most countries) your phone will select ANY available phone network it can in order to get through.

I could not figure out what to do so I restarted and my phone was working fine after that. \n\nFast forward a few hours and I am using maps again same issue. The screen in my car says couldn't connect to maps or whatever it said maps would not open on my phone and the home screen was not responding to touch although I could swipe down from the top or swipe up from the bottom just fine. I tried force closing maps but that did not work the only thing I can figure out to fix it was a reboot.\n\nPreviously I mentioned that out of nowhere the background would pop up and that was the only thing on screen no icons or nothing. I have the same brand case that I had for the other phone. Google is telling me they may have manufactured the case a little off and the edges of the case are touching the screen. Randomly my background will just pop up out of nowhere out of focus sometimes (blurry) with no icons or nothing else on the screen. I thought it was me pressing something by accident but I can't recreate it it just randomly happens. \n\n",

However, I can't do that anymore?\n\nApparently the reps I have talked to said there's no repair history for my P9P, makes sense, but because I cancelled my first repair request (I forgot to pick prepaid shipping box from google) and made another request, each one was for my 3a. Because of the multiple submissions? (Just the 2) It's causing me to error on any future repair requests somehow? Whenever I have clicked to start a repair for my P9P it just gives me \"A repair order already exists for this device. If you have questions,¬†contact us.\" \n\nWhat's weirder is when you click on the contact us from that quote, any chat sessions you request goes into a \"death loop\" meaning if I were to refresh and try to request a chat session on the computer, it'll say chat session is closed. The workaround is going to the bottom of the page and clicking that \"contact us\" link for a proper chat session to load. \n\nHas anyone ever experience this repair request wall? So far 2 reps who suggested logging out/in didn't work, and their attempts to clear that 3a cancellation repair request has yet to clear off. How is there store page that bad to do even basic repair requests??",

    "selftext": "I have a Pixel 9 Pro XL.  At some point within the last week or two I started having a problem either in my photos or my files apps.  Whenever I screenshot something, it does not appear in my gallery and when I go to my screenshots folder in the Photos app or try to open the images folder in the Files app, the app essentially freezes up.  (Similarly, this happens when I attempt to download pictures as well.)  I first noticed this when I took a screenshot and went to send it on Discord and the picture had a blank thumbnail.  When I clicked the thumbnail, my Discord got to the point where I had to force close it to get it functioning correctly again.  I'm at the point where if I forget and accidentally download or screenshot something, I have to restart my phone to access any pictures on my phone.  I'm kinda stumped and was wondering if anyone's had a similar problem or might have some solution or troubleshooting I can do.  Thanks a lot!",

    "selftext": "The past few months, my Pixel 8 has randomly flickered green. Sometimes it's only a little greenish tint, sometimes it renders my phone unusable because the screen looks like green static. Through Reddit, I discovered that a gentle squeeze on the bottom of the phone would (sometimes) fix the issue, albeit temporarily. I didn't really want to continue this practice and potentially damage the phone.\n\nTwo nights ago, it was flickering, but wouldn't go back with a gentle squeeze. I put it on its charger and in the morning, it was fine, no more green. However, now there is a neon vertical line off-center to the right side of the screen that extends from the top to the bottom and does not go away. \n\nI contacted customer service yesterday and they told me that, if I could send them the invoice for the phone purchase, we could go over potential options (they told me that based on purchase date, it was out of warranty). I was at work and didn't have this proof of purchase on me, but they said I could send them the invoice at any point in the next 24 hours. I went to the local AT&T store and retrieved the invoice for the phone, then sent it along in the support chat. \n\nAt this point, the person (or bot) I was chatting with had changed names. After sending the receipt, I was informed that my only options were to either mail it to them or take it to a UBreakIFix location that was out-of-state and inconvenient for travel. I asked why they had me retrieve the invoice, and got different answers from multiple reps, including a supervisor. I believe that, ultimately, it was not necessary.\n\nHas anyone else had to jump through hoops to have this issue fixed? \n\nI'm kind of annoyed that the onus of repair is put entirely on the customer when Google is aware of this problem, which was created on their end.

I have not seen even cheap Chinese Phones with Sub INR 10k swelling up suddenly within 2 years as with this shit Pixel 7. And now the Service Centre in Noida is trying to Scam me by saying perfectly working Display needs to be changed. \n\nBecause of this I have now lost trust in Google‚Äôs repair process.

On Android, it feels like the UI commits to vertical too easily unless my swipe is perfectly straight.\n\nWhere I see it most  \n‚Ä¢ Walmart cart screen: the horizontal suggestions under the cart love to scroll the page vertically instead of sliding sideways.  \n‚Ä¢ Amazon product pages: the horizontal ‚ÄúSponsored‚Äù product carousels often scroll the page vertically on small diagonals.  \n‚Ä¢ Messenger apps: media carousels and horizontal chips regularly misinterpret diagonals.\n\nWhat I already tried  \n‚Ä¢ Fully updated system and apps  \n‚Ä¢ Tuned back-gesture edge sensitivity  \n‚Ä¢ Turned on touch-sensitivity / screen-protector mode(Just checked it out although I have no screen protection on)  \n‚Ä¢ Temporarily used 3-button nav while testing\n\nQuestions  \n‚Ä¢ Do you see the same diagonal-to-vertical behavior on recent Pixels?  \n‚Ä¢ Any hidden settings, flags, or launcher/gesture tweaks that improve horizontal direction-locking?  \n‚Ä¢ If you moved from iOS, did this bother you at first and then fade as you adjusted your swipe angle?\n\nConstructive ask to Google/Android devs  \nPlease prioritize this. Bias the recognition toward horizontal when the initial movement suggests a sideways swipe, or give us a setting to prefer horizontal direction-lock.

    "selftext": "One thing I've found weird was the Pixel 10 Pro's **brightness and shadow sliders are swapped** compared to previous phones. I confirmed this is on Camera 10.0 AND Camera 10.1 (I got the update yesterday).\n\nIt's always been muscle memory for me to adjust the shadows a bit because I don't like the crushed shadows look. Over the past few weeks I've found it frustrating that it seems my images don't adjust the way I want it to and only last week it dawned upon me after looking at the icons more closely that the sliders are swapped compared to my Pixel 9 and older phones and I've been adjusting brightness on my Pixel 10 the first few weeks when I intended to adjust shadows.\n\nYesterday I wondered if it was a Camera 10.1 change and so I updated my Pixel 9 Pro to Camera 10.1 too. **The order stays the same on Camera 10.1 where brightness is on top on the Pixel 9 Pro**. In some further investigation I opened Pro Mode and I wonder if this is the reason--in pro mode, Shadows appears first on the Pixel 10 whereas Brightness appears first on the Pixel 9. Perhaps this order is also linked to why the sliders are swapped on the Pixel 10.\n\n**Clearing data/storage on my Pixel 10 doesn't change anything**\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n* Pixel 9 Pro on Camera 9.9 and 10.1: Brightness Top, Shadows Bottom\n\n* Pixel 10 Pro on Camera 10.0 and 10.1: Brightness Bottom, Shadows Top\n\nScreenshots: https://i.imgur.com/cbKyEhd.png",

I had no problems whatsoever. After updating to Android 16, that's where the problems started. The signal icon automatically appears with an exclamation mark (!) and no signal at all. It's ONLY fixed by restarting, but it only works for 3-5 minutes before it goes back to the same thing. No signal, no data, NOTHING. What did you do to the modem in Android 16, Google? Is this a strategy to get me to switch to a new Pixel and then do the same thing? I've tried everything: factory reset, changing SIM cards, reinstalling the software, and nothing fixes it I've seen it on different forums, and it really is a real problem affecting 4 out of 10 Pixel 8 Pro users. It's truly outrageous that Google hasn't provided a real solution, knowing full well that thousands of Pixel 8 Pro users are experiencing the SAME problem after the update. The worst part is that my warranty expired about 6 months ago, so I'm the one who loses out. I'm sure that if Google doesn't release an update that fixes the modem issue, I'll never buy another Pixel phone again.",

    "title": "I got the OFFICIAL Camera Update (10.1.076.821848723.18). The Verdict: THE STUTTER IS NOT FIXED.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.ü§ù**",

    "selftext": "So for the past 24 hours I've been trying to understand why my Google AI Plan (the Gemini and 2tb plan) wasn't included with my purchase of the Pixel 9 Pro last year, as advertised. Just to be clear, I bought the phone in January when the promotion was still active, I received the offer, but when I went to redeem the offer apparently it didn't work correctly and instead it put me on a paid plan. I wasn't paying attention, which is totally my fault, and didn't notice I was getting charged $9.99 a month for the 2tb plan, instead. The customer service agents I spoke to told me there as an error with the offer, which is why it wasn't redeemed correctly. They are also telling me too bad, and that there is nothing I can do... So apparently a glitch in their system is my fault, and they are willing to lose a customer over it. I just don't understand how we got to this point. Its clear that the many customer service reps aren't given the authority to help me, and I get that, but they can't even elevate my case to someone that can help. I am soooooo understanding of how horrible it must be to work customer service and I deal with people like this every day for my job, I know it isn't their fault. But why is Google so comfortable with losing a customer over something so trivial? I've had Pixel's since day one, been a google customer since gmail came out, and have joined Insider programs to be a part of the community... Why do they think its ok to treat customers like this after admitting it wasn't my fault?",

Solution: call your city's NON emergency 911 number. The person then routed me to a dispatcher. I asked if there was a way for me to test if my phone would dial 911 properly. She told me just to hang up and call 911 right now. I did that, the same dispatcher picked up. I told her it's me again, thanks for letting me test it. She said, no problem and hung up. \n\nI think if you're very concerned about this potential issue, just call the non emergency number for your city and explain it to them. The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes. You can select the notification and dismiss this. ",

    "selftext": "I wanted to make this because so many people complain on this subreddit about the phone not being fast enough, or having the best specs, etc, etc and wanted to give my perspective as a lifelong Android user since I got my first Smartphone, which was an HTC myTouch in 2010.\n\nThe reality is, Google has moved past a specs race and enthusiast market with this phone and the past recent pixel phones, and it's evident not only in their marketing for it and how they want you to use their phone with Gemini, but also who they're targeting in general.\n\nIn the past, the phone was aimed at enthusiast and it flopped. I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

I have, and then the auto generated one shows up later.  Just kind of an annoying oddity, and I can't even think of what troubleshooting steps to take on something like this - what cache might need to be cleared, what setting could be toggled off/on, etc.\n\nAny ideas?",

    "selftext": "Hello !\n\nI got a problem with my week old 9a, I charged it last night to around 66%, the phone wasnt warm at all. I woke up during the night and the phone was unbelievably hot. System settings said that it was around 40¬∞C, which is right at the threshold of it being slightly overheating. I was in 5g, it wasn't charging, the screen wasn turned off for hours although I do have always on display activated and I wasn't in sleep modee, I have adaptive battery on and only have allowed unlimited background activity to a couple apps like Instagram or Discord in order to get their notifications as soon as they arrive. \n\nThe only thing I can think of was that it was underneath my pillow while I was sleeping, but it shouldn't have generated that amount of heat if it wasn't doing something. That and the always on display being on that night. 10% of battery disappeared between when I stopped charging and when I noticed the heat, Instagram was the app that used the most battery during this time. I only ever had 3 or 4 percent disappearing during an entire night, so 10% in 3-4 hours seems like a lot.\n\nThe phone doesn't even heat that much when using it intensively or when charging. The heat wasn't located in a single spot, it was all over the screen at the same level. I had to turn it off in order for it to go back to normal, and since then, nothing.\n\nHas anyone ever encountered a problem like this ? I've seen reports of heating issues with these phones on Reddit but nothing that matches my experience.",

Unless something changed wiith tech I think its quite unusual.\n\nI know battery apps are not usually perfect but I get the same amount of 4200 reported from one that measures via charging cycles, and one that reads the hardware info directly from the device.\n\n**Authenticity checker / QR Code**\n\nI've read on the device authenticity checker that genuine products should come with a holographic QR code but I don't recall seeing one on my last Pixel, so I could be wrong?\n\nAlso the manufacturing year mismatch via the authenticity checker seems off to me but no idea if there could be a genuine discrepancy? My other pixels self reported dates matched the ones on this site.\n\nIts a shame that we can no longer see the \"first activated\" date.\n\n**Phone Region**\n\nI'm guessing if the phone was manufactured in China, that's why it might prompt me to set the region as China when first loading? Again I have bought pixels before and never seen this, but I think I did see somthing similer with my oneplus.\n\nAnyway, I'd be grateful for anyone more knowledgable to chime in and let me know if my suspicions are correct - I don't mind having a refurb, but I could have paid less by *intentionally* buying one.",

    "title": "I got the OFFICIAL Camera Update (10.1.076.821848723.18). The Verdict: THE STUTTER IS NOT FIXED.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.ü§ù**",

I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

Solution: call your city's NON emergency 911 number. The person then routed me to a dispatcher. I asked if there was a way for me to test if my phone would dial 911 properly. She told me just to hang up and call 911 right now. I did that, the same dispatcher picked up. I told her it's me again, thanks for letting me test it.

The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes. You can select the notification and dismiss this. ",

    "title": "Some games aren't working on a brand new P7 Pro. + My weeklong journey with the Pixel so far.",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: Got a brand-new and (until yesterday) factory sealed Pixel 7 Pro, three games either hang or crash immediately, despite working fine on my previous Pixel. Everything else on the phone runs perfectly afaik.\n\nThis is mostly me asking for help but I've had a bit of a journey over the last week and I might ramble a little bit before I get to my actual issue. I'm a week and two devices into my journey with the Pixel 7 Pro now, easily the most expensive phone I've ever owned and huge upgrade from my old Galaxy A50.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago I bought an 'acceptable quality' refurbished Pixel 7 Pro on Amazon for ¬£210. It arrived last Wednesday and despite a slight bit of cosmetic damage and a few minor scratches on the screen that weren't even visible when the screen was on was fairly chuffed with it, I'd spent a bit of time playing around with it's camera and all the other little features that came with it, and got to setting everything up until barely 3 hours after swiching it on when it suddenly just switched itself off at around  what should've been 65%-70% battery and refused to turn back on again, only when plugged into the wall would it power on but after barely a second on the splash screen it would immediately shut off again and just keep bootlopping from there i did manage to get into the bootloader/fastboot menu but no further from there.\n\nAbout a day later it just suddenly started working again, and I'd managed (with some power button/volume spamming, I don't even remember how) to get it into some 'no command' screen and then into android itself. I had already contacted the seller yesterday to tell them it had suddenly stopped functioning so I messaged again to update them, of course my issues didn't stop there, at random points it would once again just turn off, though unlike the first time I was able to just turn it back on again. I was incredibly suspicious of the reseller anyway as they included an M360 diagnostic report that [showed 100% battery health despite their own diagnostic report showing it had been through 1050 battery cycle](https://imgur.com/a/czQaFiS)s.\n\nBy Saturday evening I'd had enough after it did it TWICE in the span of 20 minutes at work so I got home, factory wiped it and informed the seller of my intent to return it and went shopping around for another phone, I did 'really' like the Pixel 7 from the bit of time I had with it so I went around looking at the newer Pixels and on Monday I found an Ebay listing for a brand new and sealed Pixel 7 Pro for only ¬£300 so instead I dived on that. \n\n\nIt arrived yesterday and after and after confirming it was indeed brand new and factory sealed, I let it charge to full for a few hours since it was entirely dead before switching it on for the first time, spent a bit of time getting everything setup again and updating the firmware from it's factory version of Android 13 to 16, great, everything working, I'm quite happy until try to launch a couple of the games to get them setup and properly downloaded.\n\n\n\n\n**Now my ACTUAL issue.**\n\nThree of the four games I usually have installed: Old School Runescape, Nikke and Rome Total War, all of which worked on the previous refurbed Pixel refuse to work on the new one. I'm fairly certain it's not the games themselves and I don't have a clue on why it would be the phone itself. The new phone has been fully updated and as far as I'm aware were/are both on the 1st October patch that the one I returned was on.\n\nI don't generally game on mobile so the game I do play are usually just ones I play on PC anyway and have cross-progression. If only one of them was having issues I'd just brush it off but three of the four I tested is a bit more worrisome.\n\n\n**Old School Runescape:** Will either hang on a black screen when launched before popping up a 'not responding' error or it'll simply show the app icon on said black screen and nothing more.\n\n**NIKKE:** Will get to it's load screen but stop loading at step 5/7 at exactly 57% won't progress any further.\n\n**Rome Total War:** Will launch but on the screen where it requires you to acknowledge it needs a periodic internet connection to work, tapping accept will force-close/crash the game back to homescreen.\n\n\n**Umamusume** on the other hand DOES work, I was able to get that working just fine, as far as the game's lobby screen without any issues.\n\n\nAnyone having any similar issues, problems or any possible fixes? I've tried the usual troubleshooting steps, reinstalling the apps, clearing cache/data for both the games and Google Play services, rebooting the phone but zero luck so far. Short of a factory wipe and doing all the setup again I'm not entirely certain where to go from here. I did a bit of Googling and found that last months Android update *might* be causing issues for some people across multiple different Pixel models.",

Over the past few weeks I've found it frustrating that it seems my images don't adjust the way I want it to and only last week it dawned upon me after looking at the icons more closely that the sliders are swapped compared to my Pixel 9 and older phones and I've been adjusting brightness on my Pixel 10 the first few weeks when I intended to adjust shadows.\n\nYesterday I wondered if it was a Camera 10.1 change and so I updated my Pixel 9 Pro to Camera 10.1 too. **The order stays the same on Camera 10.1 where brightness is on top on the Pixel 9 Pro**. In some further investigation I opened Pro Mode and I wonder if this is the reason--in pro mode, Shadows appears first on the Pixel 10 whereas Brightness appears first on the Pixel 9. Perhaps this order is also linked to why the sliders are swapped on the Pixel 10.\n\n**Clearing data/storage on my Pixel 10 doesn't change anything**\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n* Pixel 9 Pro on Camera 9.9 and 10.1: Brightness Top, Shadows Bottom\n\n* Pixel 10 Pro on Camera 10.0 and 10.1: Brightness Bottom, Shadows Top\n\nScreenshots: https://i.imgur.com/cbKyEhd.png",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been on iOS for \\~15 years. I decided not to get the iPhone 17 Pro Max after feeling there wasn‚Äôt much real innovation over the last four years and jumped to a Pixel 10 Pro XL for the AI features. The phone feels legitimately powerful and I like a lot about it.\n\nOne thing is driving me nuts. When I try to swipe horizontally, a slight diagonal thumb swipe often turns into a vertical scroll. On iOS, the system seems to ‚Äúget‚Äù my intent and direction-locks to horizontal. On Android, it feels like the UI commits to vertical too easily unless my swipe is perfectly straight.\n\nWhere I see it most  \n‚Ä¢ Walmart cart screen: the horizontal suggestions under the cart love to scroll the page vertically instead of sliding sideways.  \n‚Ä¢ Amazon product pages: the horizontal ‚ÄúSponsored‚Äù product carousels often scroll the page vertically on small diagonals.  \n‚Ä¢ Messenger apps: media carousels and horizontal chips regularly misinterpret diagonals.\n\nWhat I already tried  \n‚Ä¢ Fully updated system and apps  \n‚Ä¢ Tuned back-gesture edge sensitivity  \n‚Ä¢ Turned on touch-sensitivity / screen-protector mode(Just checked it out although I have no screen protection on)  \n‚Ä¢ Temporarily used 3-button nav while testing\n\nQuestions  \n‚Ä¢ Do you see the same diagonal-to-vertical behavior on recent Pixels?  \n‚Ä¢ Any hidden settings, flags, or launcher/gesture tweaks that improve horizontal direction-locking?  \n‚Ä¢ If you moved from iOS, did this bother you at first and then fade as you adjusted your swipe angle?\n\nConstructive ask to Google/Android devs  \nPlease prioritize this. Bias the recognition toward horizontal when the initial movement suggests a sideways swipe, or give us a setting to prefer horizontal direction-lock. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is fantastic overall, but this one behavior makes you miss the ‚Äúsmooth and floating‚Äù feel that IOS has.",

At some point I have to move my esim from my current Pixel 9 Pro XL to my 3a due to accidental screen crack. I tend to do mock-up repair requests but never submit them to see what my estimate costs will look like. However, I can't do that anymore?\n\nApparently the reps I have talked to said there's no repair history for my P9P, makes sense, but because I cancelled my first repair request (I forgot to pick prepaid shipping box from google) and made another request, each one was for my 3a. Because of the multiple submissions? (Just the 2) It's causing me to error on any future repair requests somehow? Whenever I have clicked to start a repair for my P9P it just gives me \"A repair order already exists for this device. If you have questions,¬†contact us.\" \n\nWhat's weirder is when you click on the contact us from that quote, any chat sessions you request goes into a \"death loop\" meaning if I were to refresh and try to request a chat session on the computer, it'll say chat session is closed. The workaround is going to the bottom of the page and clicking that \"contact us\" link for a proper chat session to load. \n\nHas anyone ever experience this repair request wall? So far 2 reps who suggested logging out/in didn't work, and their attempts to clear that 3a cancellation repair request has yet to clear off. How is there store page that bad to do even basic repair requests??",

Through Reddit, I discovered that a gentle squeeze on the bottom of the phone would (sometimes) fix the issue, albeit temporarily. I didn't really want to continue this practice and potentially damage the phone.\n\nTwo nights ago, it was flickering, but wouldn't go back with a gentle squeeze. I put it on its charger and in the morning, it was fine, no more green. However, now there is a neon vertical line off-center to the right side of the screen that extends from the top to the bottom and does not go away. \n\nI contacted customer service yesterday and they told me that, if I could send them the invoice for the phone purchase, we could go over potential options (they told me that based on purchase date, it was out of warranty). I was at work and didn't have this proof of purchase on me, but they said I could send them the invoice at any point in the next 24 hours. I went to the local AT&T store and retrieved the invoice for the phone, then sent it along in the support chat. \n\nAt this point, the person (or bot) I was chatting with had changed names. After sending the receipt, I was informed that my only options were to either mail it to them or take it to a UBreakIFix location that was out-of-state and inconvenient for travel. I asked why they had me retrieve the invoice, and got different answers from multiple reps, including a supervisor. I believe that, ultimately, it was not necessary.\n\nHas anyone else had to jump through hoops to have this issue fixed? \n\nI'm kind of annoyed that the onus of repair is put entirely on the customer when Google is aware of this problem, which was created on their end.

    "title": "I got the OFFICIAL Camera Update (10.1.076.821848723.18). The Verdict: THE STUTTER IS NOT FIXED.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.ü§ù**",

    "selftext": "I wanted to make this because so many people complain on this subreddit about the phone not being fast enough, or having the best specs, etc, etc and wanted to give my perspective as a lifelong Android user since I got my first Smartphone, which was an HTC myTouch in 2010.\n\nThe reality is, Google has moved past a specs race and enthusiast market with this phone and the past recent pixel phones, and it's evident not only in their marketing for it and how they want you to use their phone with Gemini, but also who they're targeting in general.\n\nIn the past, the phone was aimed at enthusiast and it flopped. I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

She told me just to hang up and call 911 right now. I did that, the same dispatcher picked up. I told her it's me again, thanks for letting me test it. She said, no problem and hung up. \n\nI think if you're very concerned about this potential issue, just call the non emergency number for your city and explain it to them. The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes. You can select the notification and dismiss this. ",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: Got a brand-new and (until yesterday) factory sealed Pixel 7 Pro, three games either hang or crash immediately, despite working fine on my previous Pixel. Everything else on the phone runs perfectly afaik.\n\nThis is mostly me asking for help but I've had a bit of a journey over the last week and I might ramble a little bit before I get to my actual issue. I'm a week and two devices into my journey with the Pixel 7 Pro now, easily the most expensive phone I've ever owned and huge upgrade from my old Galaxy A50.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago I bought an 'acceptable quality' refurbished Pixel 7 Pro on Amazon for ¬£210. It arrived last Wednesday and despite a slight bit of cosmetic damage and a few minor scratches on the screen that weren't even visible when the screen was on was fairly chuffed with it, I'd spent a bit of time playing around with it's camera and all the other little features that came with it, and got to setting everything up until barely 3 hours after swiching it on when it suddenly just switched itself off at around  what should've been 65%-70% battery and refused to turn back on again, only when plugged into the wall would it power on but after barely a second on the splash screen it would immediately shut off again and just keep bootlopping from there i did manage to get into the bootloader/fastboot menu but no further from there.\n\nAbout a day later it just suddenly started working again, and I'd managed (with some power button/volume spamming, I don't even remember how) to get it into some 'no command' screen and then into android itself. I had already contacted the seller yesterday to tell them it had suddenly stopped functioning so I messaged again to update them, of course my issues didn't stop there, at random points it would once again just turn off, though unlike the first time I was able to just turn it back on again. I was incredibly suspicious of the reseller anyway as they included an M360 diagnostic report that [showed 100% battery health despite their own diagnostic report showing it had been through 1050 battery cycle](https://imgur.com/a/czQaFiS)s.\n\nBy Saturday evening I'd had enough after it did it TWICE in the span of 20 minutes at work so I got home, factory wiped it and informed the seller of my intent to return it and went shopping around for another phone, I did 'really' like the Pixel 7 from the bit of time I had with it so I went around looking at the newer Pixels and on Monday I found an Ebay listing for a brand new and sealed Pixel 7 Pro for only ¬£300 so instead I dived on that. \n\n\nIt arrived yesterday and after and after confirming it was indeed brand new and factory sealed, I let it charge to full for a few hours since it was entirely dead before switching it on for the first time, spent a bit of time getting everything setup again and updating the firmware from it's factory version of Android 13 to 16, great, everything working, I'm quite happy until try to launch a couple of the games to get them setup and properly downloaded.\n\n\n\n\n**Now my ACTUAL issue.**\n\nThree of the four games I usually have installed: Old School Runescape, Nikke and Rome Total War, all of which worked on the previous refurbed Pixel refuse to work on the new one. I'm fairly certain it's not the games themselves and I don't have a clue on why it would be the phone itself. The new phone has been fully updated and as far as I'm aware were/are both on the 1st October patch that the one I returned was on.\n\nI don't generally game on mobile so the game I do play are usually just ones I play on PC anyway and have cross-progression. If only one of them was having issues I'd just brush it off but three of the four I tested is a bit more worrisome.\n\n\n**Old School Runescape:** Will either hang on a black screen when launched before popping up a 'not responding' error or it'll simply show the app icon on said black screen and nothing more.\n\n**NIKKE:** Will get to it's load screen but stop loading at step 5/7 at exactly 57% won't progress any further.\n\n**Rome Total War:** Will launch but on the screen where it requires you to acknowledge it needs a periodic internet connection to work, tapping accept will force-close/crash the game back to homescreen.\n\n\n**Umamusume** on the other hand DOES work, I was able to get that working just fine, as far as the game's lobby screen without any issues.\n\n\nAnyone having any similar issues, problems or any possible fixes? I've tried the usual troubleshooting steps, reinstalling the apps, clearing cache/data for both the games and Google Play services, rebooting the phone but zero luck so far. Short of a factory wipe and doing all the setup again I'm not entirely certain where to go from here. I did a bit of Googling and found that last months Android update *might* be causing issues for some people across multiple different Pixel models.",

I could not figure out what to do so I restarted and my phone was working fine after that. \n\nFast forward a few hours and I am using maps again same issue. The screen in my car says couldn't connect to maps or whatever it said maps would not open on my phone and the home screen was not responding to touch although I could swipe down from the top or swipe up from the bottom just fine. I tried force closing maps but that did not work the only thing I can figure out to fix it was a reboot.\n\nPreviously I mentioned that out of nowhere the background would pop up and that was the only thing on screen no icons or nothing. I have the same brand case that I had for the other phone. Google is telling me they may have manufactured the case a little off and the edges of the case are touching the screen. Randomly my background will just pop up out of nowhere out of focus sometimes (blurry) with no icons or nothing else on the screen. I thought it was me pressing something by accident but I can't recreate it it just randomly happens. \n\n",

I confirmed this is on Camera 10.0 AND Camera 10.1 (I got the update yesterday).\n\nIt's always been muscle memory for me to adjust the shadows a bit because I don't like the crushed shadows look. Over the past few weeks I've found it frustrating that it seems my images don't adjust the way I want it to and only last week it dawned upon me after looking at the icons more closely that the sliders are swapped compared to my Pixel 9 and older phones and I've been adjusting brightness on my Pixel 10 the first few weeks when I intended to adjust shadows.\n\nYesterday I wondered if it was a Camera 10.1 change and so I updated my Pixel 9 Pro to Camera 10.1 too. **The order stays the same on Camera 10.1 where brightness is on top on the Pixel 9 Pro**. In some further investigation I opened Pro Mode and I wonder if this is the reason--in pro mode, Shadows appears first on the Pixel 10 whereas Brightness appears first on the Pixel 9. Perhaps this order is also linked to why the sliders are swapped on the Pixel 10.\n\n**Clearing data/storage on my Pixel 10 doesn't change anything**\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n* Pixel 9 Pro on Camera 9.9 and 10.1: Brightness Top, Shadows Bottom\n\n* Pixel 10 Pro on Camera 10.0 and 10.1: Brightness Bottom, Shadows Top\n\nScreenshots: https://i.imgur.com/cbKyEhd.png",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

(The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra?

Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve never been a big fan of Samsung electronics. Didn‚Äôt have anything against them per se, but I just wasn‚Äôt often impressed by them. I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I‚Äôm there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now.

We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799.

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve used the S22 Ultra before and really liked the design and One UI, even though the battery life wasn‚Äôt the best. Now I‚Äôm looking at the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra and wanted to hear from people who‚Äôve spent time with them.\n\nOn paper they seem very close, but I‚Äôm curious about how they actually feel day to day. How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra‚Äôs S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who‚Äôs been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

I almost feel like this wasn't even tested before the update got sent out and I'm furious at how bad it is.",

However when I did this, I found that I could no longer download any apps onto the watch. Whenever I go into the Galaxy Store on the watch, it just doesn't display any app results whatsoever- I click the recommended tab, 'no results'. I search for a specific app, 'no results'. Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed? If anyone has the solution to this problem it would be appreciated. \n\nP.s. sorry the screenshots are in Polish, but it just essentially says 'no results' as I stated above.",

Now four weeks out I'm above 50%.  Charging times have been correspondingly reduced.  The only change I can think of is being totally dissatisfied with Samsung Health exporting data I've limited what it exports, but it's still exporting heart rate 24/7, and I think that gets sent to the phone even without using Samsung Health at all.\n\nHave others notice similar significant changes in battery drain?\n\nEdit:  I should have knocked wood after posting. Today it was down to 18% which hasn't happened since the first week.  No unusual uses yesterday.",

    "selftext": "Hello, ever since the last Galaxy Watch update my stopwatch setting has been minimizing to the very bottom of my watch. I am a public speaker and use the timer to stick to my time and I have perfected deceptively peaking at my watch without the audience seeing. But if it's damn near microscopic I cannot and it's really annoying on stage. Last time I had to pretend I was checking my steps in order to see what time I'm at. Does anybody know how I can set it to the old way where it takes up the whole screen? It also does this for the timer, which is also annoying when I'm at the gym and it minimizes it when I'm doing 1 minute reps. But that's not as essential. I have googled other reddit posts but they're all old/out dated/have instructions to options that no longer exist. I'd really appreciate some help. Thank you! ",

Also Watch 7 is half price cheaper than Watch 8 in my country.\n\nBut after doing some research on Watch 7, it has a lot issue with GPS. I pause my urge to buy it since it got issue with the GPS. I'm not into fitness, but on turn-by-turn navigation and GPS accuracy.\n\nIs the latest update already fix the GPS issue?\n\nSorry for my English since it not my first language.",

    "selftext": "So...... my phone (S21 Ultra) took a dive in a swimming pool.   I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

It turns out that there is a maximum number of alarms you can have in your Alarm app. I deleted all my alarms and tried setting a new one again, and it worked without any errors.\n\nI discovered this because when I attempted to set an alarm using Bixby, it informed me that I had reached the maximum number of alarms. However, when using Gemini, it simply gives an \"UNKNOWN ERROR\" message, even though it behaves as if the alarm was set. If you're not checking the watch display after asking Gemini, you might not even realize there's been an error.\n\nThanks to everyone who tried to help me earlier!",

I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement?

    "selftext": "I loved the design and specs of Watch Ultra and was considering getting it. However, upon seeing it in person, I thought it was too bulky for me and my usage profile.\n\nSo even if the design is less attractive (for me obviously), I'm now considering Watch 8 (non LTE version). But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

I had to get a new watch because something shredded under my bezel and everytime I'd spin it, something black or clear would work it's way from under the bezel. I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

    "selftext": "I loved the design and specs of Watch Ultra and was considering getting it. However, upon seeing it in person, I thought it was too bulky for me and my usage profile.\n\nSo even if the design is less attractive (for me obviously), I'm now considering Watch 8 (non LTE version). But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

I do manually put my phone/watch into Sleep mode every night and manually turn off every morning. I have even shaved my wrist under the watch because I am quite hairy.\n\nUsually, it tells me I fell asleep 3 hours after I actually fell asleep and wake up time has been somewhat accurate. Last night.....it told me I did not sleep at all and after I woke up and sat on the couch for an hour it told me I had just finished a nap.

Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed?

I‚Äôm not a gamer or a tech expert ‚Äî just a casual player who wants a solid, future-proof laptop that will last for several years.\n\nI‚Äôll mostly use it on weekends, not daily, but I still want good performance and build quality for the price.\n\nI‚Äôm deciding between these two options:\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüíª Lenovo IdeaPad Slim (around 4100 PLN)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAMD Ryzen 7 8845HS (8 cores / 16 threads, up to 5.1 GHz)\n\t‚Ä¢\tRadeon 780M integrated graphics\n\t‚Ä¢\t24 GB DDR5 RAM\n\t‚Ä¢\t1 TB SSD\n\t‚Ä¢\t16‚Äù IPS 1920x1200, 60 Hz, matte\n\t‚Ä¢\tBattery: up to 14h, 50 Wh\n\t‚Ä¢\tWeight: 1.81 kg\n\t‚Ä¢\tAluminum build, military-grade durability\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüíª HP Victus (around 4000 PLN)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIntel Core 5 210H (8 cores / 12 threads, up to 4.8 GHz)\n\t‚Ä¢\tNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB\n\t‚Ä¢\t32 GB DDR5 RAM\n\t‚Ä¢\t1 TB SSD\n\t‚Ä¢\t15.6‚Äù IPS 1920x1080, 144 Hz\n\t‚Ä¢\tBattery: 70 Wh\n\t‚Ä¢\tWeight: 2.29 kg\n\t‚Ä¢\tDedicated GPU, G-Sync, DLSS 4 support\n\n‚∏ª\n\nI‚Äôm torn between the two. Lenovo has a sleek aluminum body, a bigger screen, and great build quality ‚Äî but the HP has a dedicated GPU and more RAM, which might help with Sims performance.\n\nWhat do you think? Which one would be better for my use case?\n",

    "selftext": "I travel for work a lot and want to game when I'm on the road but gaming laptops seem like you're always compromising. Desktop replacements with RTX 4070 or higher are like 2000+ and weigh 7 pounds which defeats the purpose of a laptop. Thinner gaming laptops with RTX 4060 are more portable but then you're not really getting great performance for the money. Battery life on all of them sucks, most reviews say 3-4 hours max doing normal stuff and way less gaming. I mainly play stuff like Elden Ring and whatever new releases come out, want to run things at high settings 1080p minimum. If Black Friday drops a good gaming laptop to like 1400-1600 I'd bite but I'm worried about buying something that's underpowered or will have thermal issues.\n\nHas anyone regretted buying a gaming laptop instead of just getting a desktop and using a regular laptop for travel? And do gaming laptops have real Black Friday deals or just the same prices with inflated MSRPs to make discounts look bigger?",

Was kinda boring with Windows 11.\n\nCouple of days later (after speaking with a friend - he wanted to buy it from me) I got a MacBook Air M4. What a piece of machinery! Slick, compact, so beautiful and the OS seemed so nice...until I actually started using it.\n\nWTF is Apple doing with its software... is this supposed to be easy to use? Even Linux has far better usability. I installed all kinds of apps to make it behave properly, like actually close the App with X, then make the windows maximize by clicking on the title and lots, lots more. I searched in Homebrew, made all kind of changes, but it felt too unintuitive. The cooperation with AirPods & iPhone is perfect, but the OS itself is a mess.\n\nSpoke with my friend again, he said he wants that too. I told him he can get only 1 and he said I can give him which I don't need. So last night, I set up the Windows Laptop again, after 3 days of weirdness of the macOS, I feel like using an OS that makes sense. Today is the day he gets the MacBook. I wish him luck as he never used a Mac.",

    "selftext": "Every laptop cooler is either insanely loud or barely does anything. But can it be silent and actually lower temperatures at the same time?  \n  \nThink about it: to cool a laptop with a stand, air has to pass through tiny gaps in the chassis. If you don't seal them with foam, the air just escapes and barely goes through, that's massive air resistance to overcome! For that, you'd need a fan with high static pressure, which means high RPM and a lor of noise.\n\nHere's what I did: In a previus \\[post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1nxymi3/i\\_just\\_installed\\_my\\_dream\\_mod\\_and\\_i\\_love\\_it/), I installed a custom heatsink over the laptop's heatpipes, drawing heat straight out, it already help thermals a lot passively. Now I have a hot plate on the back of the laptop, so I don't need airflow through the case, I just need to cool the plate. I used an ultra-low noise Noctua A12-25 LS-PWM fan pointed directly at it. Result: dissipating about 46 watt between CPU and GPU almost silently.\n\nI even tested with Furmark 2 at full \"stock\" GPU power (80W), with the laptop fans at minimum (2000RPM). I swear, It's so quiet that even slight coil whine sounds louder than the fans. Temperatures stay under 76C.\n\nI'm super proud of the result, I don't think I've ever seen a laptop so quiet while handling such high dissipation.",

    "selftext": "Before heading out at me, I have a brother who is quite spoiled and he broke his laptop months ago. Yesterday he decided to buy project zomboid to play on my laptop even though I only intend to use it for officework (it's designed ONLY for writing documents, yes it can handle some low end games) I did not give him permission to use it, other than that he can encode some important schoolwork. I just don't want him to damage my elitebook (it's quite cheap but money is tight) by him gaming over hours while plugging on the charger cause my laptop heats up easily.\n\nI know there is an option to remove his account from my laptop however I don't want to go into a full blown argument about disobeying his wants at the expense of me being mentally drained. So how do I temporarily put lag or something to ruin his experience while gaming? (I'm not a big techie)",

    "selftext": "I travel for work a lot and want to game when I'm on the road but gaming laptops seem like you're always compromising. Desktop replacements with RTX 4070 or higher are like 2000+ and weigh 7 pounds which defeats the purpose of a laptop. Thinner gaming laptops with RTX 4060 are more portable but then you're not really getting great performance for the money. Battery life on all of them sucks, most reviews say 3-4 hours max doing normal stuff and way less gaming. I mainly play stuff like Elden Ring and whatever new releases come out, want to run things at high settings 1080p minimum. If Black Friday drops a good gaming laptop to like 1400-1600 I'd bite but I'm worried about buying something that's underpowered or will have thermal issues.\n\nHas anyone regretted buying a gaming laptop instead of just getting a desktop and using a regular laptop for travel? And do gaming laptops have real Black Friday deals or just the same prices with inflated MSRPs to make discounts look bigger?",

    "selftext": "Haven't had a PC for many years, so I decided it was time. All this time I had a work laptop that is locked to the bone and my main device is an iPhone 13PM, and I did it all there, movies, YouTube, etc.\n\nSo I got an Asus Zenbook 14\" Ryzen AI 7 350 / 32GB RAM/ OLED Screen, set it up, installed VS Code/VS Studio and some other apps. Was kinda boring with Windows 11.\n\nCouple of days later (after speaking with a friend - he wanted to buy it from me) I got a MacBook Air M4. What a piece of machinery! Slick, compact, so beautiful and the OS seemed so nice...until I actually started using it.\n\nWTF is Apple doing with its software... is this supposed to be easy to use? Even Linux has far better usability. I installed all kinds of apps to make it behave properly, like actually close the App with X, then make the windows maximize by clicking on the title and lots, lots more. I searched in Homebrew, made all kind of changes, but it felt too unintuitive. The cooperation with AirPods & iPhone is perfect, but the OS itself is a mess.\n\nSpoke with my friend again, he said he wants that too. I told him he can get only 1 and he said I can give him which I don't need. So last night, I set up the Windows Laptop again, after 3 days of weirdness of the macOS, I feel like using an OS that makes sense. Today is the day he gets the MacBook. I wish him luck as he never used a Mac.",

    "selftext": "Every laptop cooler is either insanely loud or barely does anything. But can it be silent and actually lower temperatures at the same time?  \n  \nThink about it: to cool a laptop with a stand, air has to pass through tiny gaps in the chassis. If you don't seal them with foam, the air just escapes and barely goes through, that's massive air resistance to overcome! For that, you'd need a fan with high static pressure, which means high RPM and a lor of noise.\n\nHere's what I did: In a previus \\[post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1nxymi3/i\\_just\\_installed\\_my\\_dream\\_mod\\_and\\_i\\_love\\_it/), I installed a custom heatsink over the laptop's heatpipes, drawing heat straight out, it already help thermals a lot passively. Now I have a hot plate on the back of the laptop, so I don't need airflow through the case, I just need to cool the plate. I used an ultra-low noise Noctua A12-25 LS-PWM fan pointed directly at it. Result: dissipating about 46 watt between CPU and GPU almost silently.\n\nI even tested with Furmark 2 at full \"stock\" GPU power (80W), with the laptop fans at minimum (2000RPM). I swear, It's so quiet that even slight coil whine sounds louder than the fans. Temperatures stay under 76C.\n\nI'm super proud of the result, I don't think I've ever seen a laptop so quiet while handling such high dissipation.",

I‚Äôm not a gamer or a tech expert ‚Äî just a casual player who wants a solid, future-proof laptop that will last for several years.\n\nI‚Äôll mostly use it on weekends, not daily, but I still want good performance and build quality for the price.\n\nI‚Äôm deciding between these two options:\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüíª Lenovo IdeaPad Slim (around 4100 PLN)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAMD Ryzen 7 8845HS (8 cores / 16 threads, up to 5.1 GHz)\n\t‚Ä¢\tRadeon 780M integrated graphics\n\t‚Ä¢\t24 GB DDR5 RAM\n\t‚Ä¢\t1 TB SSD\n\t‚Ä¢\t16‚Äù IPS 1920x1200, 60 Hz, matte\n\t‚Ä¢\tBattery: up to 14h, 50 Wh\n\t‚Ä¢\tWeight: 1.81 kg\n\t‚Ä¢\tAluminum build, military-grade durability\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüíª HP Victus (around 4000 PLN)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIntel Core 5 210H (8 cores / 12 threads, up to 4.8 GHz)\n\t‚Ä¢\tNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB\n\t‚Ä¢\t32 GB DDR5 RAM\n\t‚Ä¢\t1 TB SSD\n\t‚Ä¢\t15.6‚Äù IPS 1920x1080, 144 Hz\n\t‚Ä¢\tBattery: 70 Wh\n\t‚Ä¢\tWeight: 2.29 kg\n\t‚Ä¢\tDedicated GPU, G-Sync, DLSS 4 support\n\n‚∏ª\n\nI‚Äôm torn between the two. Lenovo has a sleek aluminum body, a bigger screen, and great build quality ‚Äî but the HP has a dedicated GPU and more RAM, which might help with Sims performance.\n\nWhat do you think? Which one would be better for my use case?\n",

I just don't want him to damage my elitebook (it's quite cheap but money is tight) by him gaming over hours while plugging on the charger cause my laptop heats up easily.\n\nI know there is an option to remove his account from my laptop however I don't want to go into a full blown argument about disobeying his wants at the expense of me being mentally drained.

    "selftext": "I travel for work a lot and want to game when I'm on the road but gaming laptops seem like you're always compromising. Desktop replacements with RTX 4070 or higher are like 2000+ and weigh 7 pounds which defeats the purpose of a laptop. Thinner gaming laptops with RTX 4060 are more portable but then you're not really getting great performance for the money. Battery life on all of them sucks, most reviews say 3-4 hours max doing normal stuff and way less gaming. I mainly play stuff like Elden Ring and whatever new releases come out, want to run things at high settings 1080p minimum. If Black Friday drops a good gaming laptop to like 1400-1600 I'd bite but I'm worried about buying something that's underpowered or will have thermal issues.\n\nHas anyone regretted buying a gaming laptop instead of just getting a desktop and using a regular laptop for travel? And do gaming laptops have real Black Friday deals or just the same prices with inflated MSRPs to make discounts look bigger?",

All this time I had a work laptop that is locked to the bone and my main device is an iPhone 13PM, and I did it all there, movies, YouTube, etc.\n\nSo I got an Asus Zenbook 14\" Ryzen AI 7 350 / 32GB RAM/ OLED Screen, set it up, installed VS Code/VS Studio and some other apps. Was kinda boring with Windows 11.\n\nCouple of days later (after speaking with a friend - he wanted to buy it from me) I got a MacBook Air M4. What a piece of machinery! Slick, compact, so beautiful and the OS seemed so nice...until I actually started using it.\n\nWTF is Apple doing with its software... is this supposed to be easy to use? Even Linux has far better usability. I installed all kinds of apps to make it behave properly, like actually close the App with X, then make the windows maximize by clicking on the title and lots, lots more. I searched in Homebrew, made all kind of changes, but it felt too unintuitive. The cooperation with AirPods & iPhone is perfect, but the OS itself is a mess.\n\nSpoke with my friend again, he said he wants that too. I told him he can get only 1 and he said I can give him which I don't need. So last night, I set up the Windows Laptop again, after 3 days of weirdness of the macOS, I feel like using an OS that makes sense. Today is the day he gets the MacBook. I wish him luck as he never used a Mac.",

    "selftext": "Every laptop cooler is either insanely loud or barely does anything. But can it be silent and actually lower temperatures at the same time?  \n  \nThink about it: to cool a laptop with a stand, air has to pass through tiny gaps in the chassis. If you don't seal them with foam, the air just escapes and barely goes through, that's massive air resistance to overcome! For that, you'd need a fan with high static pressure, which means high RPM and a lor of noise.\n\nHere's what I did: In a previus \\[post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1nxymi3/i\\_just\\_installed\\_my\\_dream\\_mod\\_and\\_i\\_love\\_it/), I installed a custom heatsink over the laptop's heatpipes, drawing heat straight out, it already help thermals a lot passively. Now I have a hot plate on the back of the laptop, so I don't need airflow through the case, I just need to cool the plate. I used an ultra-low noise Noctua A12-25 LS-PWM fan pointed directly at it. Result: dissipating about 46 watt between CPU and GPU almost silently.\n\nI even tested with Furmark 2 at full \"stock\" GPU power (80W), with the laptop fans at minimum (2000RPM). I swear, It's so quiet that even slight coil whine sounds louder than the fans. Temperatures stay under 76C.\n\nI'm super proud of the result, I don't think I've ever seen a laptop so quiet while handling such high dissipation.",

    "selftext": "\nLast September, I built my PC with a B550 motherboard, Ryzen 5900X, and 32GB of 3600MHz DDR4 RAM. When I first installed it, the RAM defaulted to around 2300MHz, but I went into the BIOS and enabled the 3600MHz profile so it would run at its advertised speed. Everything was stable for about a year ‚Äî I even left my PC running overnight sometimes without any problems.\n\nRecently though, my system started freezing randomly, and now it‚Äôs basically unusable. When I took it to a technician, they told me that running my RAM at 3600MHz was actually considered overclocking, and that might have caused instability or damage.\n\nI‚Äôm kind of confused because I thought that if RAM is sold as 3600MHz, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs supposed to run at. Is the tech right? Did I accidentally overclock my system even though I was just enabling XMP/DOCP? And could that really cause the freezing issues I‚Äôm seeing now?\n\nAny insight would be appreciated ‚Äî I just want to understand what might‚Äôve gone wrong before I replace parts.",

Whenever it disconnects I can't connect to my router or an AP router and ipconfig says \"media disconnected\". I tried different cables and other devices don't have this issue so I'm positive its the ethernet port on my MOBO. So should I get a PCIe network card or is a USB ethernet dongle enough to get rid of this problem? Will a dongle slow down my internet speed significantly?",

Then also got tempted with the 6800xt(400$) or 7800xt(500$). But after doing some research, 9060xt 16gb caught my eye. I dont think i wont be upgrading soon after this purchase so I think its best for me to get the newest one. \n\n9060xt 16gb is around 450$ here brand new. \nI found some used 3080 for the same price amd 3080ti for around 550$. And Now im kinda confused which one to buy. \n\nI think 3080ti can still handle a few years. Its much better than 9060xt in terms of performance too. \n\nI want to know which one you‚Äôll get if you were me. 3080 or 9060xt. Budget is less than 500$\n\nMy psu is 650w \n\nI don‚Äôt really care about the graphics that much. I mean, I do. But not to the point that id spend more than my budget. \n\nI just want to know if i‚Äôll be happy with a 9060xt upgrading from a 1650s. I don‚Äôt really want to make any regrets. \n",

    "selftext": "Hi, so I¬¥m currently running my outdated gtx 1060 which I¬¥m looking to upgrade. I have been looking around a bit and found some intressting options but would like some help from people who know what they are talking about. I am between AMD or Nvidia, more specific rx 9060/7600 or rtx 5060/5070. My budget is max 500 USD and I play mostly 1080p 144hz FPS games but would of course be nice for the card to be a bit future proof if I would like to play more graphics heavy games. Which cards would you recommend me to buy?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "So i dont know what to call them but i hope you will get the idea. \nIm kinda conflicted on which case i should get for my recent build (The one i got atm is a bit too small).\nI've seen both these type of cases online but i noticed that the ones with front-side fans might have a little bit more space.\n\nNow what it really matters for me is airflow.  Which one is better? By my logic the one with fans in the front should be better but is the difference really that big?\n\nHere are 2 examples for refference:\n1. Deepcool cg580 4f (front-side)\n2. Montech air 903 max (front)\n\nAlso, if i add an extra fan on the floor for the one with side-fans(1) will it help the airflow?\n\nPs: I have to mention that ill be using a cpu air cooler at this moment (phatomspirit 120)",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm currently looking to upgrade my setup with a new keyboard and I'm struggling to find something perfect (or close to it).\n\nI'm looking for either a mechanical or magnetic/HE keyboard that is a little more interesting to look at than the bog standard gaming keyboard. Ideally the base/frame of it would be black, or a dark colour of some sort.\n\nThe sort of look I'm going for would have something extra, like knobs or dials, little interesting additions to the frame maybe, or even cool gimmicks like small displays or something.\n\nExamples I've found of these sorts of things would be the Nuphy Field75 (frame additions, knobs, cool buttons), Skyloong GK104 (knobs, displays), RK S98 (knobs, displays). But none of them are ideal. The Nuphy is so close to it but the HE only comes in a light gray and the mechanical one (in better colours) is discontinued.\n\nDoes anyone have any hints or suggestions of others that might tick some of these boxes?\n\nPrice-wise I'd probably stretch to ¬£200, maybe a bit more for the right one. I'm not precious about brand names but I want to avoid \"Chinesium\" that'll let me down within a year due to bad build quality.\n\n\nTLDR: Suggestions for a cool mechanical or HE keyboard in dark colours with any funky buttons/knobs/displays/frame additions, ¬£250 or under, that isn't trash quality.\n",

A lot of the features in it, its UI, functionalities and the rest are AI slop. One of the most annoying things that makes my workflow slow is when you hover over a multiple windows icon in your task bar, then you click and choose a window but you make a mistake so end up holding your click and you hover over another window, this would never work. You will need to click somewhere and start all over again. \n\nThe UI has also become extremely counter-intuitive. There are so many things that have always been a staple in Windows since its inception or for a very long time, now have become nowhere to be found, removed, or downright not working.\n\nThe new Task Manager is completely useless, again, looks cool on the surface but functionality is so bad. \n\nI tap out. I went back to my windows 10. Win10 just feels like a more complete and functional product. ",

In the past Ive played games like RDR2 and GOW, since BF6 has been released, I was so hyped to play it and noticed that my PC seems to struggle(or the GPU). Ive noticed these struggles with RDR2 too(none with GOW). The GPU seems to crash once im 20-30 minutes in-game. This drives me crazy since I usually dont have time to play and once I play it just doesnt work.. The screen turns black and I hear my GPU shutting off. I tried to update the drivers and clean the PC, but nothing seems to help.\n\nSo Im asking for your advice, Im thinking of upgrading my GPU to an RTX(maybe 5060?) and I want to stay away from AMD. Friends that I play with use Geforce RTX GPUs and have 0 problems, no crashing, no lagging, nothing.. \n\nI will post the build that I currently have and if anyone with any knowledge could guide me or give me any ideas what I could change, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe graphics card is RX5600XT, it would be a perfect GPU for me since it has enough power to run pretty much every game that I want, but the crashes...\n\nThe build I currently have: [https://de.pcpartpicker.com/list/7MKdBq](https://de.pcpartpicker.com/list/7MKdBq)\n\nThank you!",

I'd like to upgrade this build in about a year, like increasing the RAM and go for a R7 9800X3D as I've seen that this is the best option for gaming. \n\nAs of today, this budget is a little bit higher than what I expected, so I cannot afford more expensive options, but if there is any advice as to replace any item for a same quality/performance, or to lower the cost of some items in order to get that difference go to a high value option, it would be really good to have anyone's suggestion on how to do so.\n\nThe main use for this build will be for gaming, at 1440p with 60+ fps, Ray Tracing if available as long as the gameplay is smooth (60-80 fps range I guess?), and maybe stretch out to 4k in the future.\n The games would be Helldivers II, Elden Ring, Alan Wake 2, Stellar Blade, RDR2, and similar ones.\n\nThanks in advance for your time and advice!",

The motherboard has a¬†USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port and a Front USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 Type-C port, which I'm hoping are compatible with one of the TobenONE products. So far, I'm looking at the¬†[UDS032](https://tobenone.com/products/15-in-1-tobenone-usb-c-docking-station-dual-monitor-dock-with-150w-power-adapter-uds032)¬†or the¬†[UDS033](https://tobenone.com/products/uds033-tobenone-displaylink-docking-station-triple-monitor-with-120w-power-adapter). As far as I know, since my mobo doesn't support Thunderbolt and these specific stations don't require Thunderbolt, I should be okay. As for connecting everything, would a 30ish-foot fiber optic USB C cable be enough? As for connecting all peripherals, I'm also just hoping some USB hub would just work also plugged into the station. Also, I'm not really looking for a solution to ventilate my room better, I just want to move the PC and I already have a hole in my wall for routing cables.\n\nIf anyone has any experience running something similar or any advice, I'd appreciate it. Thanks!",

    "title": "Is future proofing worth it in my case? Budget build",
    "selftext": "Hi! I'm planning a budget build for primarily online shooters (Finals, Helldivers, ARC Raiders) and the occasional AAA. I'm only building the tower, as I'll be using this in my living room (with a Hisense U7K 120hz mini-led TV) with a controller. I'm torn between future proofing my build vs more performance now. \n\nI've narrowed it down to two options that cost almost exactly the same in my market. I've attaching the user benchmark scores for both builds too: \n\n**1) Future proof build -**  AM5 build with iGPU only (8600G) that I could upgrade in the future with a 5050 or something (I've not decided on that yet) depending on how happy I am with the user experience with just the iGPU. \n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 8600G (Not going for an 7500F or 8400F here now as I'll be relying on the iGPU solely for a while)  \nGPU: AMD Radeon 760M (iGPU)  \nSSD: Kingston 1TB  \nRAM: Kingston Fury DDR5 5600 2x8GB   \nMBD: Asus TUF GAMING B650M-E\n\n**Baseline Bench: Game 21%, Desk 95%, Work 21%**\n\n  \n**2) Not-as-futureproof as the above build:  A**M4 build with a Ryzen 5500 and an RX 7600. This outperforms the 8600G (iGPU only) right now by a significant margin. What's deterring me that it's an older age platform.\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5500 (Most attractive option in terms of price/performance in my market currently but open to suggestions. Most other options are at least 40-50% more expensive)  \nGPU: AMD RX 7600  \nSSD: Kingston 1TB  \nRAM: Kingston 8GX 2x8GB DDR4  \nMBD: Gigabyte GA-B550M DS3H\n\n**Alternative Bench: Game 47%, Desk 93%, Work 44%**\n\nI'm torn between lower performance now for the sake keeping things future proof vs significantly better performance now at the cost of future proofing. I'd love to keep things as cheap as possible but can spend more on a gpu for the 8600G build (later), but only if I  have to. \n\nIs future proofing worth the sacrifice of the better performance that? Will the 5500+7600 build get outdated very soon? It's the long run prospects that I'm concerned about. \n\nTIA! \n\n",

    "selftext": "Alright. I am tired of trouble shooting, installing intel wi-fi driver updates, and I am running out of hair to pull. My base unit is a pre build from NZXT where in the system is comprised of:\n\n\\- MOBO: B365 Phantom Gaming 4 (lame I know working on an upgrade as we speak)\n\n\\- Intel I5 9400F (all I could afford at the time)\n\n\\- 16x2 GB ddr4 3200 CL 16-18-18-38 (I know the CPU/MOBO only run at 2666)\n\n\\- MSI GEFORCE 1660 super (on a budget)\n\n\\- and a newly (inoperable) upgraded Gigabyte GC-XBAX210 wi-fi PCIE card. \n\nI am currently operating Windows 10 (64 bit). I have downloaded the following driver updates but have had zero luck with them actually allowing my computer too see the card:\n\n\\- mb\\_driver\\_630\\_dschsetup\\_23.20.0.4.\n\n\\- mb\\_driver\\_607\\_win10\\_23.20.0.3.\n\n\\- mb\\_driver\\_2683\\_mtk\\_1.1044.0.556.\n\n\\- mb\\_driver\\_2683\\_mtk\\_5.7.0.4669.\n\n\\- WiFi-23.170.0-Driver64-Win10-Win11.exe\n\n\\- BT-23.170.0-64UWD-Win10-Win11.exe\n\n\\- mb\\_driver\\_630\\_extensions\\_20.20.0.6.\n\n\\- mb\\_driver\\_607\\_win10\\_22.20.0.3.\n\nNow I can only think that either A.) The Wi-Fi card is completely inoperable, B.) None of the above drivers are compatible with my op systems, C.) I'm an idiot who doesn't know what he is doing. now option C is correct I can confirm that, but forums, reddit, shooting fish in a barrel, and many many many You tube videos later I have ended my stubborn rampage of system restarts, system information scrolling, device manager exploration, and complaints that my wife doesn't understand and turned to you this lovely community to possibly help me. \n\n  \ncurrent findings I have unearthed are as followed:\n\n\\- Device Manager > Other Devices > Network Controller > Location: PCI bus 4, device 0, function 0 > Device status: The driver for this device are not installed. (Code 28) - There are no compatible drivers for this device. - To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver. (does this mean there is a device being located but not communicated with? or does this mean there is no device being located what so ever?)\n\n\\- I've downloaded all available driver updates through intel and gigabyte that I know of which leads me to believe I am the fool who doesn't know how to watch and follow 5 You tube tutorials.\n\nany help would be awesome. I will attempt to respond to any questions and answers as soon as I possibly can because this issue is somewhat hindering my work flow and hobbies. thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Help With Building a Rack Mounted Family PC",
    "selftext": "Hey Reddit! \n\nI'm looking at building a rack mounted PC for the entire family to log into and use, mostly for gaming.   \n  \nWhilst it may be easier to build individual PCs for everyone, having a single PC seems like a great way to control what my kids can/cannot access (they are 6 and 9 years old), as well be just a fun project for us all to do together and learn from. \n\nI have just enough technical knowledge to be a danger to myself and have built 3 of my own PC's in the past, 2 of which even worked straight away!   \n\n\n**The Idea:**  \nA single PC in a data cabinet HDMI/Display port and USB patching to each bedroom. USB for keyboard and mouse as Bluetooth would be less than ideal over that distance, I assume? \n\nWe will use the PC predominantly for gaming, but also for homework, work-work, and just generally entertainment usage. \n\nEach user will have their on Windows login and Steam access via the family sharing settings. I have not investigated what sort of parental controls I can access or use through Windows, or if they would actually be any good, so suggestions on how to manage that would also be awesome!  \n  \nThe only thing I know for certain thus far is that it will be rack mounted. Only because I was able to pick up a 12RU data cabinet for free off a friend (it even has all the screws!). Dimensions are 400mm deep, 600mm tall, and 530mm wide.\n\nThe internal cabling of the house is fine, that part I can do without issue. It's the actually PC side of things that I need help with.  \n\n\n**Questions:**  \n1. *What sort of hardware should I be looking at?*  \nEverything from chassis to fans, and everything in between! I would like to mount an NAS in the cabinet at some point, but that's not a priority at this stage.\n\nI generally play single player games and nothing hugely graphically intense so I will generally play with max or close to max graphical settings. Hearts of Iron 4, Stellaris, Elder Scrolls, Baldurs Gate 3, Halo remastered, etc. \n\nIdeally the PC will be powerful enough to handle up to 4 users gaming at the same time. Obviously my kids won't be playing Baldurs Gate 3 or COD, yet, but I would like to spec it in for those scenarios so that I'm covered for future.\n\n2. *How would it work with multiple users?*  \nIf everyone has a mouse and keyboard, that means there could be 4 of each device plugged in at once (myself, my wife, and then one for each of my 2 kids), as well as at least 5 monitors (I will have 2 monitors and 1 each for everyone else), but would like the option to add more. How would the system tell each one apart without overriding or mirroring another? \n\n3. *Is this even possible?*  \nI guess this should have been question number 1... Oh well! Is this project even possible? Like I said at the top, I get that it may be easier and better for everyone to have their own PC, but this seems like a fun project! If it's actually possible... \n\nAs this is just at the concept stage, I do know what my budget is yet. Any and all advise would be greatly appreciated! \n\nLet me know if you need any additional information :)  \nThanks team!",

Not an immediate concern as it's currently winter but just planning ahead for options. \n\nMy setup needs the following (on the desk):\n\nTwo 3440x1400p monitors (Aw3423dwf and Aw3418dw) so 144hz and 100hz respectively. I can drop the framerates a bit if needed, the secondary one is only for media most of the time atm. \n\nMouse, keyboard, speakers, streamdeck, 3d-mouse, microphone, webcam. So all this is USB. Probably a couple things I'm forgetting.\n\nThough I've never tried running everything over a single USB dock before so I don't know if there can be issues with bottlenecks. At the mo it all runs from two separate hubs (one built into one of the monitors). \n\n  \nI know I can run multiple long cables. Two DP cables and a long USB3.2x2 would probably handle everything. But it would be a long run to run tidily with the 'wife approval factor' with 3 chunky cables (along with the existing cables that already run that way).\n\nThunderbolt or USB4 seems like the solution, but it seems to be extremely hard to find motherboards that have those that aren't hideously expensive. \n\nSo I'm running low on options. \n\nI can stick with an ATX board, more likely to find USB4 there at least, but ATX cases are all towers it seems and I need something that can fit on a shelf 32cm tall. Though laying a standard tower on its side is my fallback option if I can't come up with a better idea!\n\nMATX with a mff/sff case would be nice but those seem not to exist. \n\nITX won't work because my network card is SFP+ and so I need a pcie slot for it.

    "selftext": "The issue originated when I decided to upgrade my system RAM from ***2x16 GB*** to ***4x16 GB*** by adding two more matching RAM sticks (***Corsair Vengeance 5200 MHz DDR***5). I put 2 new sticks on B2 and 2 older ones in A2 slots. My system has an ***i7 14700K*** processor.\n\nInitially the system failed to stabilize at ***XMP1-5200 MHz, CR-1T*** and it defaulted to ***4533 MHz CR-2T, with 1.1 V vintage***. I used this for close to 6 months, but every time I would look at 4533 MHz on Task Manager, I would get an itch to do something. After all I paid for 5200 MHz. This was the situation until yesterday when I decided to Tweek.\n\n* **4800 MHz (Stable)** \\- I entered Gigabyte MBD, advanced settings and set default SPD, basically kept all timings of XMP1, except speed that I changed to *4800 MHz* that is the default JEDEC speed for DDR5. Except the voltage that is now 1.25 V. The system booted and Windows ran stable for a day. The command rate was 2T.\n* **5200 MHz (Unstable)** \\- But my itch was not satisfied. So, I again entered BIOS and went full throttle to *5200 MHz*. The system booted but as soon as I opened browser, screen went blank with different colors alternating. I knew there is a problem. Ran Memtest and it showed 10 errors in first 10 minutes pf pass-1.\n* **5000 MHz (Stable)** \\- I stopped the test and went to BIOS and pulled down the RAM's speed to *5000 MHz* and kept all other settings same. This time memtest completed all 4 passes without a single error.\n\n**Results**\n\n[CPU-Z Result](https://preview.redd.it/vy6f3zx486yf1.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f11062f2dbff5223f730faa1447ec63af466940)\n\n[Windows 11 Task Manager](https://preview.redd.it/r3xt27j986yf1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=77c6b4e19ea42520ba714ec938ab650fda34d152)\n\n***So this is settled for now. I think running 4 sticks of DDR5 RAM at 5000 MHz is all my processor's memory controller (i7 14700K) can handle.***",

I plan on playing typical triple A games at 1080HP currently but plan on upgrading my monitor down the road to get a high refresh rate one and one that can run 4k. I also plan to record, edit videos, and stream with this build. Please let me know any suggestions you might have. Right now I would say my budget is around $2500, but I‚Äôm willing to go slightly over. Thank you in advance.\n\nHere is the link to my build: \nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/zX2Zh7",

My question is, is air cooling still enough to keep the temps well low on a CPU like that?

But it's kinda complicated and etc., and I would prefer to stick with the usual air cooling. Obviously, I'm not gonna keep my current CPU cooler and I'm gonna buy a new better, bigger and performant one, etc. etc., but would it be fine?",

Ideally the base/frame of it would be black, or a dark colour of some sort.\n\nThe sort of look I'm going for would have something extra, like knobs or dials, little interesting additions to the frame maybe, or even cool gimmicks like small displays or something.\n\nExamples I've found of these sorts of things would be the Nuphy Field75 (frame additions, knobs, cool buttons), Skyloong GK104 (knobs, displays), RK S98 (knobs, displays). But none of them are ideal. The Nuphy is so close to it but the HE only comes in a light gray and the mechanical one (in better colours) is discontinued.\n\nDoes anyone have any hints or suggestions of others that might tick some of these boxes?\n\nPrice-wise I'd probably stretch to ¬£200, maybe a bit more for the right one. I'm not precious about brand names but I want to avoid \"Chinesium\" that'll let me down within a year due to bad build quality.\n\n\nTLDR: Suggestions for a cool mechanical or HE keyboard in dark colours with any funky buttons/knobs/displays/frame additions, ¬£250 or under, that isn't trash quality.\n",

    "selftext": "\nLast September, I built my PC with a B550 motherboard, Ryzen 5900X, and 32GB of 3600MHz DDR4 RAM. When I first installed it, the RAM defaulted to around 2300MHz, but I went into the BIOS and enabled the 3600MHz profile so it would run at its advertised speed. Everything was stable for about a year ‚Äî I even left my PC running overnight sometimes without any problems.\n\nRecently though, my system started freezing randomly, and now it‚Äôs basically unusable. When I took it to a technician, they told me that running my RAM at 3600MHz was actually considered overclocking, and that might have caused instability or damage.\n\nI‚Äôm kind of confused because I thought that if RAM is sold as 3600MHz, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs supposed to run at. Is the tech right? Did I accidentally overclock my system even though I was just enabling XMP/DOCP? And could that really cause the freezing issues I‚Äôm seeing now?\n\nAny insight would be appreciated ‚Äî I just want to understand what might‚Äôve gone wrong before I replace parts.",

Then also got tempted with the 6800xt(400$) or 7800xt(500$). But after doing some research, 9060xt 16gb caught my eye. I dont think i wont be upgrading soon after this purchase so I think its best for me to get the newest one. \n\n9060xt 16gb is around 450$ here brand new. \nI found some used 3080 for the same price amd 3080ti for around 550$. And Now im kinda confused which one to buy. \n\nI think 3080ti can still handle a few years. Its much better than 9060xt in terms of performance too. \n\nI want to know which one you‚Äôll get if you were me. 3080 or 9060xt.

Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! üôè",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community:¬†[https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

    "selftext": "How were games being developed 10-20 years ago in shorter time frames with extreme technological limitations compared to today, and yet those games were perceived much higher quality while the studios were happy with their profit margins?  \n  \nCompared to today, where you would think that with how far we‚Äôve come with technological advancement that games should be much easier to make, cost far less money to create(especially digital copies reducing disk/case production), and should run far better with the amazing hardware we all have. Yet all we hear is company XYZ cutting corners, firing staff, poor optimizations, $90 price tag etc. while somehow these companies are also still not making enough money?  \n  \nFor example, how was Infinity Ward/Activision able to make one of the greatest COD games MW2 in 16 months and run on a PS3 with 256mb ram near flawlessly, but I can‚Äôt even run Warzone smoothly on low settings on my fucking RTX5070 with 32gb RAM, and they‚Äôve been actively developing/patching that garbage for like 5-7 years? Not to mention the fact they‚Äôve milked revenue from that game the whole time through skins while MW2 was being patched for free.     \n  \n  \nIt sounds stupid, but did these companies forget about saving money by hiring talented people who can manage projects and create quality products within reasonable constraints, who understand limitations and can be creative to work around them? Why are studios hiring people who create garbage then spend a year(s) post production patching the game to make it playable? In the construction industry there‚Äôs a saying we use along the lines of, ‚ÄúIf you have time to come back and fix it, you had time to do it right the first time.‚Äù. \n  \nBit of a rant but also a general curiosity on how this industry has completely evolved to something that doesn‚Äôt seem to understand what they‚Äôve got their hands on. This seems like the best time to make unbelievable money and create amazing quality games and it just isn‚Äôt happening for some of these big names.\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n",

I think gaming rage comes from a lack of control. \n\nYou can control how YOU play. Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system. Notice how a lot of competitive games are labeled as \"toxic\"? Its because people are always blaming others.\n\nI can't think of a single time where I hard raged in a single player game. Why? Because I know that my perfomance is directly related the only variable; me. \n\nSorry for the yap. Was pooping on the toliet and just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\n",

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long road, but this one‚Äôs been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

I know for for many this is too little too late, but in my opinion Battlebit still has a charm to it that the new Battlefield just doesn't capture. Hopefully we can come back to try this, because it was so fun with the 128vs128 player servers, proximity voice chat, better destruction, arguably better gunplay than Battlefield 6.",

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ‚â† skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \nüéÆ Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

    "selftext": "I picked it up yesterday to play with my friends for the first time. I was surprised (in a positive way) at how mechanicaly complex it can be, especially the organizing and reparing the RV part of the game. It seems like the type of game that it's both fun and exciting to master in the long run, BUT I was astonished at how bad it overall works. To the point of taking you out of the immersion multiple times.\n\n\\- This is a physics-based game in which the physics barely work. The rope, the constantly clipping in and out of the RV, the weird collision issues... it's everywhere.\n\n\\- This is a pity, but there's barely a sense of danger or stakes whatosever. From time to time an animal will attack, or there will be a terrain obstacle to overcome, but that's pretty much it. In a way it's cool, this can be a calmer game that, let's say, Peak or REPO. But it also means that in the moment to moment gameplay it can sometimes be somewhat boring, especially because--\n\n\\- This is one of my biggest complaints right now. The multiplayer of this game i feel is not balanced. There were four of us in the RV, and for most of the time, it feels like the game would have worked better with just two. It didn't seem to me like there was much to be done. The person driving has such and advantage mechanically, and there can also be a person looking at the map, but other than that, this is not a Sea of Theves type of thing were EVERY person is needed to manouver the boat. The other two of us were just in the back, seated because you can NOT be walking around the RV while someone's driving because the physics turn crazy. That means it's not a time that you can spend maybe organising the cabinets, playing cards (this is not a mechanic but it would be cool) or something like that.\n\nI want to end on a positive note. Like I said, I really love the premise of the game. It's so unique and full of potential (the chain-smoking is hilarious). If it was well polished and with expanded mechanics, this could be like a land version of Sea of Thieves. But right now is everything but polished. It's so bizarre to me that this is a 1.0 release and not an early access.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe‚Äôve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It‚Äôs a fast, chaotic beat ‚Äôem up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who‚Äôs Mexican, and it‚Äôs directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt‚Äôs basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It‚Äôs been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo‚Äôs now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We‚Äôve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that‚Äôs part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I‚Äôll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pok√©mon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! üôè",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community:¬†[https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long road, but this one‚Äôs been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable.

The new game is also completely broken and not playable \n\nIt feels like every new game that comes out is so broken and incomplete. I am hopeful that this will give some room and demand for a developer to make something really special that will have little to no competition \n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm excited to announce that **Fuzion Game Dock** is now fully open source! üéâ\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Fuzion is a seamless game dock for Windows with automatic icon fetching, styling, and quite a few extra features including:\n\n- üéÆ Deal fetching from Reddit\n- üîç Omni search (searches both Steam and your local dock)\n- üöÄ Delayed and silent game launcher launching when available\n- üéØ Full gamepad support\n- And other things I forgot about\n\n**Demo Videos:**\n- [Feature Overview 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J_RkttY18Y)\n- [Feature Overview 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SxQwtXNbsM)\n- [Feature Overview 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWxGA0x2igY)\n- [Feature Overview 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1nqhvt9KJk)\n- [Feature Overview 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta0jqpnwblw)\n- [Feature Overview 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puYv7PPIAOk)\n\n**Current Status:**\nFuzion was published to the Windows Store ([UWP](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9MTL580GPQ00) | [Standalone](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP8C9QP4X6CN53)), but it's currently not displaying the dock properly in newer versions of Windows 10/11, likely due to changes in desktop rendering.\n\n**Why Open Source?**\nUnfortunately, I no longer have the time to maintain this project. Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! üôè",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam:¬†[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community:¬†[https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

    "selftext": "Hey! This is my first time in this subreddit. I come here with a question:  \nWhat is the best $100 GPU that I can get.....which will just work.\n\nHere's the context, scroll down for tldr;  \nI am 18y/o from India, I recently got a $100 grant from [hackclub.com](http://hackclub.com) for learning and working on shaders available [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Ankush_Roy), given I can only use the grant to buy GPUs. The problem here is that I do not have a Desktop. I work on my (late) father's 17y/o laptop that is a HP Compaq 420 Core 2 duo with 3GB RAM. I do not have any use for the GPU rn as we speak. But in the near future (no promises) I may build a PC if I get lucky. Also Linux support is a big factor for me so I'd like to avoid NVIDIA GPUs if possible, and am more biased towards AMD. I want GPU recommendation that can work in the near future, and also act as a paper weight until I get lucky. I don't want something beefy I want something working. I want to learn Graphics Programming using OpenGL 3+/Vulkan but unfortunately mine only supports OpenGL 2+, so any GPU in the market should work, I just want to know you peoples recommendations.\n\ntldr; GPU recommendation needed that is below $100, compatible for near future, not NVIDIA.\n\nAny help is highly appreciated!",

Basically, my laptop (HP Omen 15) suddenly goes into full black screen while browsing Chrome, it never happens during gaming or any other more demanding task. which is quite baffling.\n\nThe issue is also very random and I do not know what to do or how to describe it better. I am just browsing regularly and suddenly everything goes black, the keyboard is still turned on (I can see the lights), but the laptop is completely unresponsive and I have to hard restart it via power button. The fans are completely silent, as if everything is working normally, the screen just does not work.\n\n This actually never happened while I had Win 10, once I switched to Win 11, this issue started happening, so it might be OS related, yet that is quite far-fetched.\n\n Is there anything I can do from my side to at least diagnose/check what is going on? Please advise/help because I am out of options. Thank you!  \n",

I don't think that both my cpu and ram decided to fail at the same time, also there wasn't any short when I fumbled with the pins 2months ago, I managed to start the pc this Sunday don't ask me how I forgot, kept it idling for 10m no freeze or anything but after I turned it off, no longer started, I am in a cold room btw, there isn't any condensation on the board and if there is, that's why I'm heating up the board with a hair drier so it evaporates\n\nPlease help!, I don't wanna hear to change the board or cpu because I completed my pc at the start of summer and barely used it 1 month\n\nI also tried 2 PSUs\n\nPhoto of socket https://ibb.co/3yvRcmqN\n\n2 broken pins DDI3(shouldn't cause issues unless I use igpu) and ground pin, 2 bent VCC pins worked fine for 2 months of gaming like that",

May for a homeserver later or is it a bad idea with this specific MoBo? \nWhich (customizable) cases can y'all recommend?",

I might move to 4K eventually, but not anytime soon ‚Äî my main priority is future-proofing and long-term performance.\n\nGames I play most often:\n\nTeardown (smooth performance with heavy destruction is important)\n\nBeamNG.drive (max graphics, lots of mods and traffic)\n\nHitman 3: World of Assassination (ultra settings)\n\nEventually GTA 6 once it‚Äôs out on PC\n\n\nDo you think this build makes sense for my use case?\nI plan to buy the GPU in a few months since my 3070 Ti still holds up well for now ‚Äî I‚Äôm mostly annoyed by slow loading times from the HDD/older SSDs and occasional CPU bottlenecks.\n\nAny advice or suggestions are welcome!",

My understanding is that AMD is still slightly behind but has stepped up its game and has really delivered in its ongoing updates.\n\nDo people recommend the 5070 ti simply because ray tracing is so important to modern games as to outweigh future considerations?\n\nI'm in a situation where I need to decide if the 5070 is worth $120 more than its AMD counterpart for 1440p (and MAYBE 4k) but I don't want to think about the decision myopically.",

After paying I head to my car excited to see what‚Äôs actually in the box, hoping I actually got a 3070 Ti but doubtful. Open the box, see a card. Hopes begin to rise. Only to take a closer look to see it‚Äôs a 980 Ti. After a little cleaning I throw it in my pc and it does work. Just thought I found one of those great deals I occasionally see on here.  Not mad or upset tho. Better than getting a dead card. ",

She is mildly autistic and I think more than anything she just wants to be apart of the community more than anything. She doesnt expect some top of the line PC, just something that she can get into a make friends, play games online and not be too limited. She is adamant that she doesn't want a laptop also.\n\nShe has been playing Elder Scrolls for years and years, she loves Minecraft, Roblox, and she always talks about wanting to play RDR2 and sometimes talks about being interested in trying Cyberpunk.\n\nI guess I'm obviously most worried about price. I feel like I can spare around 600 (give or take) for the PC, I know I will need to get the peripherals also, but that part I can manage. I'd like to take advantage of Black Friday sales if possible? Can I expect any sales that will get me in this range? If so, where do you all recommend watching?\n\nI used Newegg to enter some games and see what they recommend, but it was recommending some PCs that had integrated graphics cards and saying they will play Cyberpunk at moderate settings, so I'm not trusting it. I'd rather come to Reddit and ask.\n\nThank you all in advance.",

    "selftext": "3D Analyze: The Holy Grail Software for Broke-Ass Gamers in the 2000s\n\nMan, I once watched my buddy straight-up demolish COD 6 and GTA IV on a potato setup: G41 mobo, E6400 CPU, 4GB RAM, and that onboard GMA4500 turd ‚Äì all powered by this app. FPS? Lucky to hit 20-25, but hey, it ran.\n\nBack in the day, most 3D games straight-up demanded a dedicated GPU just to boot, and that shit was luxury AF in 2008-2009. A legendary 9400GT? Around 2-3 million VND(100 USD). Cheaper crap like the 7100GS? Not even worth the hassle.\n\nEnter this software: it emulates and fools the game into thinking you've got a real discrete GPU, so your rig can actually play. Boom, access granted.\n\nBut let's be real ‚Äì it's \"playable\" at best, not smooth sailing. FPS tanks hard, graphics look like ass 'cause you gotta slam every setting to rock bottom (think 640x480 on very low). Even then, cracking 30 FPS ‚Äì the bare-minimum benchmark back then ‚Äì was a pipe dream.\n\nIf it still chugged, the squad would stack it with other hacks like Modded Drivers, GMA Booster, Swift Shader, or Software Renderer... whatever it took to gut the game and make it feather-light for bare survival.\n\nSounds nuts, right? But for us \"poor boys\" grinding in Vietnam, my country, 30 FPS was straight fantasy fuel. Tougher spots? 5-10 FPS could still get you through ‚Äì just \"keep your head down\" for real, minimizing loaded models like a stealth ninja, peeking up only when you had to.\n\n3D Analyze was a legit MVP in the war to conquer games on G31/G41 boards for bros overflowing with passion but zero budget. Hell, we even formed crews back then dedicated to \"G31/G41 vs. All Games.\"\n\nTalk about necessity breeding genius!",

I might try monitor arms but my desk is a bit wobbly and I can only fit them in the little hole. I might also do wall mounting but am unsure. Any help would be appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "I bought a K6 non-pro about a week and a half ago to replace a Logitech membrane keyboards I was getting tired of. While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup.

    "selftext": "Over the past 27 months I have bought 2 Keychron V6's for my office, after using the first one for little over a year i bought the second one for my dad for his birthday but soon the terror began.\n\nIn the 14-15th month of the first one some keys stopped registering the key strokes, i tried cleaning it (it wasn't even that dirty, just needed a bit of dusting) used iso-prop alc nothing worked. Interchanged the switches and that made it better for maybe a couple days and then back to the faulty behavior. since i was out of warranty there is was nothing for me to do in that department. My dad saw my frustration and gave me his keyboard since his work barely needs him to use a computer barely if at all.\n\nI brushed it off as dumb luck and moved on, last month the warranty expired on the new one and low and behold the second keyboard has found the same fate.\n\nOut of desperation, i soldered the switches to the PCB and that worked for a bit but after about 10 days i find myself back on square-one.\n\nI didn't want this to be rant on Keychron but it is very frustrating, especially given how expensive the keyboards are, about 9500 INR.\n\nAlso, would like to disclose I do not have any conflict of interest, meagerly an under-satisfied customer who was very enthusiastic for his new keyboard :( ",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn‚Äôt even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn‚Äôt expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

I've paired the build with a purple and green Owlab Voice Mini, and MW Fright Night deskmat. \n\nThere's nothing better than combining multiple multiple purchases into one solid theme. Best of all both the board and macropad are wireless, which feels appropriate for a Halloween theme keeping everything untethered.\n\nThis is my 6th post that's part of #keebaweek. You can find the rest of my posts here, where I'm posting a keyboard every week for a whole year, 52 boards, with 6 down and 46 more to go.\n\nWeek 1: [Vertex Arc60](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1npcvs7/im_posting_a_picture_of_a_different_mechanical/)  \nWeek 2: [Lazydesigners Cloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1ntnjbu/im_posting_a_keyboard_a_week_for_the_next_year/)  \nWeek 3: [Sneakbox AVA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1nzmknb/im_posting_a_keeb_a_week_this_is_week_3_sneakbox/)  \nWeek 4: [Viktus Styrka](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1o5mc5w/week_4_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_for/)  \nWeek 5: [Hola Mini](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1obmwjr/week_5_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_a_year/)\n\nOf course, since I'm going through the trouble to document all of these boards after building such a large collection, I've been adding their finer details to a the [cataloging and sharing app Keebuilder](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/), this way I'll eventually have all of my builds and the parts used in a single place.

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the¬†***Logitech G915 TKL***¬†and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the¬†*G515*¬†with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the¬†***Keychron K1 Max***¬†with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using¬†[launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/)¬†but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use¬†[usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

Interchanged the switches and that made it better for maybe a couple days and then back to the faulty behavior. since i was out of warranty there is was nothing for me to do in that department. My dad saw my frustration and gave me his keyboard since his work barely needs him to use a computer barely if at all.\n\nI brushed it off as dumb luck and moved on, last month the warranty expired on the new one and low and behold the second keyboard has found the same fate.\n\nOut of desperation, i soldered the switches to the PCB and that worked for a bit but after about 10 days i find myself back on square-one.\n\nI didn't want this to be rant on Keychron but it is very frustrating, especially given how expensive the keyboards are, about 9500 INR.\n\nAlso, would like to disclose I do not have any conflict of interest, meagerly an under-satisfied customer who was very enthusiastic for his new keyboard :( ",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn‚Äôt even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn‚Äôt expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

High St., Dublin, OH 43017)  \nDiscord: [Ohio MK](https://discord.gg/YmPypPj)\n\nWe've been in a bit of a scramble since our previous venue shut down, but thankfully we were able to pull something together before the end of the year!\n\n**No tickets are required**, thanks to the library having a free space for us to use. However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

    "title": "Are Asus ProArt monitors worth it?",
    "selftext": "I‚Äôve had an LG TN panel monitor for about five years now. It actually came with my first computer for college, and back then I didn‚Äôt even know there were different panel types like VA, TN, IPS, and so on.\n\nVideo editing and digital art have always been hobbies of mine, and lately I‚Äôve been doing them more professionally. I‚Äôve never had any major issues, but it does bother me sometimes when I notice that certain colors or tones look different on my phone than they do on my monitor. I eventually found out that‚Äôs because TN panels just aren‚Äôt that great when it comes to color accuracy.\n\nSince Christmas isn‚Äôt too far away, I thought it might be a good time to treat myself to a better monitor. While researching, I found the Asus ProArt series, and it was actually my top pick for quite a while (For context, I‚Äôm leaning toward the 24-inch version since it‚Äôs the most affordable, and anything bigger would take up too much space in my setup.). I really like the built-in ruler on the frame and the extra USB ports. But then I saw a few comments from people saying they had issues with color accuracy or that the resolution didn‚Äôt look as sharp as expected.\n\nOn top of that, I‚Äôve been getting ads for other IPS monitors lately, mostly gaming-focused ones, and they caught my eye too. Most of them are a little cheaper than the Asus, though not all of them have the same features I liked about the ProArt line.\n\nSo I‚Äôm wondering, is it really worth investing in the Asus for those extra features, or would pretty much any decent IPS panel do the job? If so, I'm open to suggestions of what I should get instead\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pevca7r9y5yf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=4221f682567459969aec071a21d0b0be9649f3c7\n\n",

This is all I could do for now and I searched through the posts in here and saw that people suggested mounting the monitor to the wall or buying a monitor arm or even buying a better desk, I may do those in the future when I make the budget. But a question came into my mind; can constant wobbling caused by typing damage the internals of the monitor in\nlong term? For example damaging the panel itself and worsening the backlight bleed for IPS panels or causing any other issue. Can the guys who used their monitor with a little of wobbling in years give me a little review of what has happened to their monitors. ",

I play mostly story games or action games, but I think I would hate smearing, but at the same time I would want to have kind of good black (it doesn't have to be like in VA but a little darker than in IPS). They are both my max budget so maybe you have some other recommendations in this price range? **I really need help ASAP.** \n\nI live in Europe (Poland) so I don't have all options available.\n\n[Lenovo Legion 27Q-10](https://preview.redd.it/mlyw5q9su2yf1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6641af4ba6679c8d8f3f6b79911a3524f3e0ab9)\n\n[Acer Nitro xf273uxbmiiprx ](https://preview.redd.it/ndrrr15ju2yf1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=023b60bf838f58f7ee7be054304360839147b2a8)\n\nI will be very happy with any help :)  \n\n\n",

Im just asking if someone else has tried both and which one was the \"correct choice\". I know that PPD is more important than PPI but i do sit fairly close to the monitor. I just feel like its not as immersive as i thought it would. The 32Inch that id be going for would be the PG32UCDM. ",

    "selftext": "(see my edit at the bottom)\n\nSince my one year anniversary of getting the AW3423DWF on a Black Friday deal last year was coming up I thought I'd throw some grey slides up to see how it was handling burn-in. Well... as you can see, not great. Unfortunately, now that I know it's there I'm seeing it all the time in dark scenes. I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.\n\nEdit: I have a theory as to why this burn-in was particularly bad in case other people read this post later. Yes, icons and wallpaper contributed, but others have mentioned that they haven't see such dramatic burn in even with those. Ever since I got this monitor I've been struggling to keep it in standby when not in use, despite having a 5 minute black screensaver and 10 minute standby. I would find it randomly awake and it wouldn't go back to sleep unless I forced it. I'd see it sleep and then immediately wake up, or walk away and come back to find it on. (I'm talking about the monitor, not PC).\n\nWell, I think I fixed it after finding another thread on this: **input auto-select needs to be turned off in the monitor menu**. For some reason it would keep it from sleeping properly. I just tried it and it worked perfectly and now immediately enters the pixel refresh like it's supposed to. I have a feeling that this bug was kicking it out of standby constantly and not letting it do a refresh every four hours, despite being set to. That would have definitely made burn in worse if it was only doing it at night when I shut the PC off and not during the day.\n\nNo idea if this is the smoking gun, but it likely contributed.",

Im just asking if someone else has tried both and which one was the \"correct choice\". I know that PPD is more important than PPI but i do sit fairly close to the monitor. I just feel like its not as immersive as i thought it would. The 32Inch that id be going for would be the PG32UCDM. ",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve had an LG TN panel monitor for about five years now. It actually came with my first computer for college, and back then I didn‚Äôt even know there were different panel types like VA, TN, IPS, and so on.\n\nVideo editing and digital art have always been hobbies of mine, and lately I‚Äôve been doing them more professionally. I‚Äôve never had any major issues, but it does bother me sometimes when I notice that certain colors or tones look different on my phone than they do on my monitor. I eventually found out that‚Äôs because TN panels just aren‚Äôt that great when it comes to color accuracy.\n\nSince Christmas isn‚Äôt too far away, I thought it might be a good time to treat myself to a better monitor. While researching, I found the Asus ProArt series, and it was actually my top pick for quite a while (For context, I‚Äôm leaning toward the 24-inch version since it‚Äôs the most affordable, and anything bigger would take up too much space in my setup.). I really like the built-in ruler on the frame and the extra USB ports. But then I saw a few comments from people saying they had issues with color accuracy or that the resolution didn‚Äôt look as sharp as expected.\n\nOn top of that, I‚Äôve been getting ads for other IPS monitors lately, mostly gaming-focused ones, and they caught my eye too. Most of them are a little cheaper than the Asus, though not all of them have the same features I liked about the ProArt line.\n\nSo I‚Äôm wondering, is it really worth investing in the Asus for those extra features, or would pretty much any decent IPS panel do the job? If so, I'm open to suggestions of what I should get instead\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pevca7r9y5yf1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=4221f682567459969aec071a21d0b0be9649f3c7\n\n",

It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.\n\nEdit: I have a theory as to why this burn-in was particularly bad in case other people read this post later. Yes, icons and wallpaper contributed, but others have mentioned that they haven't see such dramatic burn in even with those. Ever since I got this monitor I've been struggling to keep it in standby when not in use, despite having a 5 minute black screensaver and 10 minute standby. I would find it randomly awake and it wouldn't go back to sleep unless I forced it. I'd see it sleep and then immediately wake up, or walk away and come back to find it on. (I'm talking about the monitor, not PC).\n\nWell, I think I fixed it after finding another thread on this: **input auto-select needs to be turned off in the monitor menu**. For some reason it would keep it from sleeping properly. I just tried it and it worked perfectly and now immediately enters the pixel refresh like it's supposed to. I have a feeling that this bug was kicking it out of standby constantly and not letting it do a refresh every four hours, despite being set to. That would have definitely made burn in worse if it was only doing it at night when I shut the PC off and not during the day.\n\nNo idea if this is the smoking gun, but it likely contributed.",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

Also designed and built in Germany for my fellow r/BuyFromEU volks.\n\nThe DAC on-top is a Topping D10s, one of the first HiFi products I got and it runs great too. What can I say: It's a DAC. Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice. But other than that I am so happy and juet feel peace with this setup. It sounds great, has lots of power and will hopefully last me a long time.",

    "selftext": "Hello everybody! so Long time ago (2016-17) my brother bought the AKG K44 and I remember it‚Äôs sounding incredible. He also had a Scarlet 2I2 sound card.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a year that we dont talk anymore and i wanted to buy the same by buying an AKG product. And so i went in with the AKG K72. However ALOT of problems have risen up Rn.\n\nThe audio sounds HORRIBLE! Its muffled, with me having to equalize the hell out of the headphone to sound the similar to my IEMs or the AKG K44. (I use the Onboard Motherboard sound card ‚Äúgigabyte P110-D3‚Äù for more info) \neven then it screws my video/audio editing precision up,(volume control, General Equalization etc.) making me double check my videos twice with my IEMs. \n\nWhen I equalize it, i balance the bass but still give the cheap feeling  of when you listen to something with a bit of Bassy, the high and mids just go ‚Äúlow volume‚Äù mode. (Not sure that might be a sound card problem idk im new to the audio world)\n\nI was wondering if this is a fake headphone or not? And just general tips on what to do?\nThe headband just lost its stitches on its inner rubber and i had to stitch it myself (after 2 weeks of use btw).\nThe printing has some minor smudges on the font. As if they didnt paint it well, The cable feels nice tho and does not feel fake‚Ä¶ but overall feels sketchy.\n\n(Im from iran and we dont have customer support here so i cant do anything but just look for tips here. Due to sanctions eveything is twice as expensive and banned here. Even buying stuff from amazon.)\n\nI‚Äôve heared that if i buy a sound card (UE Volt 1) it will make it sound better, but im not sure‚Ä¶ should it? Imean my brother‚Äôs K44 sounded amazing no matter what u plugged it into.\n\nSo what do i do?\n\nStart editing with my IEMs again?\nBuy the UE VOLT 1 sound card?\nGet a razor black shark V2X?\njust stop using the K72 entirely?\nI really dont know what to do tbh‚Ä¶ ",

I do not mean that as a joke, these cans are audio garbage and I don't know why folks keep buying them. \nI'm making this review based on memory from a couple months ago since I basically got rid of them as soon as they came.\n\nBass: DISTORTED BLOATED DUMPSTER FIRE.\nOh boy the bass on these is absolutely horrid, I actually thought something was wrong with my pair until I looked at the distortion charts and yep it aligns with what I heard. \nSubbass: rolled off and flabby at the same time, no matter how I powered it. It was just very farty and anything close to normal volume made it sound extremely sad. I am not joking when I say this but an HD600 with a subbass shelf has cleaner bass. IT CANNOT DO SUBBASS EVEN STOCK.\n\nMids: actually not too bad, nothing to write home about. I honestly don't know what to say about it except for its mediocre and VERY IN YOUR FACE. Suicideboys was the only artist that sounded okay.\n\nHighs: OH BOY IT GETS WORSE, there is something real nasty goin on in the low-mid treble. This was something that could not be fixed with mods or whatever I did. Maybe it's a reflection or resonance from the driver cover? I tried everything in the book and I could not fix it.\nBut anyway, the treble wasn't fun. It was a hazy mess, any track sounded sharp and not detailed at the same time. I can accept being slightly piercing IF there is a good amount of detail output.\n\nThe baseline is that there are WAYYY better cans at the same price. I have also seen DMS recommending them and I can sort of understand why since his listening volume is extremely low (compared to mine) and doesn't run into the same distortion problems (I think).",

All over this sub, and other IEM subs have repeatedly said, \"If you can get it loud enough then you don't need an amp!\" LIES!\n\nI went to a headphone shop today, I brought my own dongle DAC/Amp. Tried a bunch of headphones. You know what? Yes I could get the demo units up to par listening volume. It was loud enough. Didn't even need to get to 80% volume for it to be loud. Huh, sounds decent.\n\nThen the guy said to try it with a dedicated desktop amp. I plugged it in, and lo' and behold, the audio is richer, soundstage is bigger, the headphones came ALIVE. Before, it was tinny and flat, but loud enough. Crazily, with the amp, the volume was actually set lower. Did I volume match? No, but I didn't need to because I could hear the difference before I got to the same volume. \n\nI always turn the volume down to zero before swapping anything. Before I even got halfway there to the same volume, I could already hear how much richer the sound was.\n\nFYI, it was a Samsung S22 Ultra -> Luxury & Precision W4 -> 4.4mm Out, this was the dongle DAC setup that actually sounds quite phenomenal for IEMs, but with headphones the W4 simply could not produce enough juice to *really drive* the headphones (HiFiMAN Edition XS). \n\nSo, do you need an amp if you are using headphones? The technical answer is no, but if you want to get the best out of it, then yes you do.",

    "title": "CVJ Neko: CVJ Neko: bass that hits and voices that whisper.",
    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n‚Üí Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n‚Üí Punchy bass.  \n‚Üí Delicious female vocals.  \n‚Üí Soundstage above average.  \n‚Üí No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n‚Üí DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n‚Üí If you are a purist, stay away.  \n‚Üí Mids somewhat soft.  \n‚Üí Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30‚Ç¨/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a ‚Äúmore and better.‚Äù\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:**¬†present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:**¬†this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:**¬†here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:**¬†somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:**¬†maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:**¬†with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:**¬†substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:**¬†too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:**¬†I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:**¬†at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:**¬†placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:**¬†keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:**¬†could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:**¬†testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko‚Äôs character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos‚Äô voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:**¬†testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once‚Ä¶ I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:**¬†dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:**¬†not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:**¬†paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:**¬†I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it‚Äôs unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you have fun‚Äù vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

    "title": "My experience with QCC Pro, BTD700 on iPhone 17 pro",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/hzhh291a74yf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1330b369663156fd2593bc89c456bd2a8ca3e1fb\n\nHi everyone:\n\nI used both the QCC Pro and BTD700 dongles to test various codecs (aptX, aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC) and noticed some distortion in the high frequencies‚Äîespecially with piano tracks. This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn‚Äôt test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can‚Äôt go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle ‚Äî I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would‚Äôve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn‚Äôt have a mobile app, but there‚Äôs one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn‚Äôt update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they‚Äôre very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side ‚Äî the QCC Pro‚Äôs mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro‚Äôs design but prefer the BTD700‚Äôs price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they‚Äôre an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey‚Äôre extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I‚Äôm very sensitive ‚Äî even picky ‚Äî about anything pressing on my head (I can‚Äôt stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw‚Äôs traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft ‚Äî genuinely reminiscent of Herm√®s leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Herm√®s bags, you‚Äôll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not good for solo performances ‚Äî I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it‚Äôs more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced ‚Äî I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water‚Ä¶ and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2flmc5e914yf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=70db2ea529ba5f5b1230ac28b4d91c7ec2cfedce\n\nSo, I want to talk about DACs. Personally, I‚Äôm not a believer in all that snake oil ‚Äî people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don‚Äôt buy it. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I‚Äôve always thought that if there‚Äôs any difference, it‚Äôs basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time ‚Äî I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a ‚Äúbigger soundstage,‚Äù I just assume it‚Äôs because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I‚Äôm open-minded ‚Äî I‚Äôll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that‚Äôs matched, everything else ‚Äî bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging ‚Äî sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I‚Äôm out. Either they‚Äôre trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don‚Äôt. In either case, their opinions don‚Äôt mean much to me anymore, because I can‚Äôt hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let‚Äôs talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn‚Äôt tell exactly what at first, but it didn‚Äôt feel like my imagination. After more testing ‚Äî switching headphones, replaying the same tracks ‚Äî I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head ‚Äî especially those higher notes ‚Äî in a way the K7 doesn‚Äôt. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that‚Äôs somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it‚Äôs like their voice locks into one spot ‚Äî more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this ‚Äî it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you ‚Äî same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat‚Äôs not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer‚Äôs right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste ‚Äî some benefit from that extra space, some don‚Äôt. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** ‚Äî *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn‚Äôt huge, but it‚Äôs there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It‚Äôs actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it‚Äôs slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less ‚Äúexciting.‚Äù The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah ‚Äî I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It‚Äôs pricey, and there‚Äôs no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat‚Äôs my honest take.",

    "selftext": "So I previously had upgraded from some generic brand headphones to the JBL Quantum One's. They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/32zx7vorb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=936216526ef630db67623a4916762c4a044cddee\n\n* The build quality and smoothness of the volume dial is excellent, feels and looks expensive in that Quad retro aesthetic kind of way.\n* The rear output mutes when headphones are connected on the front.\n* You can connect up dedicated 5V USB-C power input if using a non-USB source input which powers the R1 anyway along with data to a computer etc. You do not get more power running a dedicated power input as well as USB-C data.\n* The VU meter thing cannot be adjusted, it is fixed.\n* There are 4 preset EQs that cannot be customised, EQ 3 and 4 are the warmest sounding whilst 1 appears to be neutral.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3a1zapac2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b34214ad52527851a08aeda46634e265b1d77cf\n\nToggling input when playing via USB results in an overly longer than expected delay before USB input is resumed as it kills the USB connection when switching input to something else, meaning the computer doesn't see it any more and when going back to USB yo have to wait for it to initialise the USB input and be detected by the OS again.\n\nThere does not seem to be a USB DAC delay on initial audio playback which is great, but there is a very slight clipping noise that can be heard if there has been no audio playing and suddenly you play something like a Windows screenshot tone etc. This is something i have seen on other USB DACs before such as Toppings but not something I hear on more premium models like the X9, even without installing the Eversolo USB driver. This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

I got sick of the provided headset so I bought this set for work, being wireless, good battery life, good mic features (that noise fence tech is the real MVP). Usually I'll wear these over a set of flathead IEMs when I'm on the phone. These can do dual connection with BT and the usb dongle, just never really thought to use them for my phone. I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

    "selftext": "Today I received the brand-new FiiO K13 R2R DAC/AMP, which I picked up mainly out of curiosity to explore the sound signature of R2R technology. My current setup includes the Topping DX5 II, which absolutely shines with electronic genres (rave, techno, acid, house, IDM, EDM) you name it.. It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That‚Äôs exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I‚Äôll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you‚Äôve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!",

But this is my office, and although I do have a nice stereo system here, headphones are sometimes more adequate. I've recently got a pair of Sennheiser HD600s, powered by a Fiio K11 R2R, and they work fine.\n\n  \nPerhaps my questions are more on the subject of headphones than of this one in particular, maybe. I use Sonus Faber Sonettos here, and I absolutely love them. The headphones just seem \"constrained\" maybe. I am not good at describing such things. But they seem to be lacking \"openness\" and some space. Don't know if it's the HD600s, the amp, or just the nature of headphones themselves, being placed in your head for example, I know their weight may be a factor, I don't know, just not feeling it.\n\n  \nHope any of you can relate and give me some advice, thank you all!",

    "selftext": "I listened to both back-to-back, and both sounded amazing, but I definitely felt like the Ananda Nano was clearer and on every track, and you could definitely notice a difference. \n\nHowever, people kept saying the Edition XS bass is better than the Nano, but I felt the Nano's bass hit harder, and sometimes felt like it was overdone. \n\nFor example, I played Drakes ‚ÄúFrom Time‚Äù, and the bass sounded boomy, different to how my AirPods Pro 2, Edifier R2000DB and how the Edition XS presenter the bass - they all sounded correct. Nano‚Äôs bass sounded overdone Sort of similar to how the AirPods Pro 3 sounded, like it was too V-shaped. I prefer a neutral headphone with a slight V-emphasis. I don‚Äôt understand why the Nano would present the bass in this way given everyone has said it‚Äôs a neutral headphone. Can this bass be EQ‚Äôd?\n\nThe XS sounded perfect, but the Ananda Nano sounded a bit boomy. But on every other track, the bass sounded tight and great, and there was just more separation and overall clarity on the Ananda Nano. But people kept saying it's like an analytical, dry headphone. I'm open to EQing it, like I have an EQ software on my PC, but what would you recommend between the two of them?",

In this review, I‚Äôll be speaking about the Kiwi Ears Ardor, a pair of Wireless Over Ear headphones with ANC capabilities and sold for a competitive listing price.\n\n>*Disclaimer: the Kiwi Ears Aventus were sent to me by Kiwi Ears so that I could write an honest review. This review represents my personal opinion on the set, it isn't promotional or paid content and I don‚Äôt get any revenue from the sales of this product.*  \n*At the time of the review, the Kiwi Ears Aventus were on sale for about $72.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4giq7q011yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee4768ab389034deee24688b0c66af6a709d16cd\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Type of headphone ‚Üí Over-Ear\n* Driver Configuration ‚Üí Dual DD 40mm + 10mm coaxial\n* Bluetooth version ‚Üí 5.4, supporting SBC and AAC codecs (no AptX, no LDAC) +¬† low-latency mode\n* Bluetooth range ‚Üí 8-10m (free open environment)\n* ANC ‚Üí Hybrid ANC, noise reduction depth -32B¬±3dB\n* Battery capacity and declared battery life ‚Üí 1000mAh, for a total of about 18hrs with ANC+RGB ON, 45hrs with ANC ON and 82hrs with ANC OFF\n* Fast charging ‚Üí Yes, 10 mins of charge correspond to 4 hours of playback (with ANC OFF)\n* Frequency response ‚Üí 20Hz-40KHz\n* Impedance ‚Üí 16‚Ñ¶ ¬± 10% @ 1KHz\n* Sensitivity ‚Üí 102dB ¬± 3dB @ 1KHz 1mW\n* Weight ‚Üí 290g (measured on my own non-professional scale)\n* Charging port ‚Üí Type-C\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus come well packed and the box contains:\n\n* The Kiwi Ears Aventus\n* A Detachable Audio cable\n* A USB Type-C charging cable\n* A USB Type-C charging data cable\n* One pair of tuning foam pads\n* A User Manual\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pai8tu1211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32969399057b4033a0436c5ea40f887de653a619\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wvslc2211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9efb4d8248c5ec6bca280f13fac1bff2531f3a08\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ronqcdr311yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c12208d2b329ec81ee43216ecbae80d793fd5442\n\n# Design, Build Quality, Comfort and Isolation\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus look very ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù-ish, with a pretty thick junction between the earcups and the sliders and a large headband. The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn‚Äôt seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only.¬†\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90¬∞C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don‚Äôt cheap when clicked since there‚Äôs enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more ‚Äúpremium‚Äù (but that‚Äôs just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn‚Äôt have the chance to test the full 45¬† hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone‚Äôs bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren‚Äôt objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it‚Äôs pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven‚Äôt experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you‚Äôll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you‚Äôre not getting Bose-like ANC you‚Äôre still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I‚Äôm on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn‚Äôt emphasize things too much making them almost ‚Äúartificial‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn‚Äôt low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you‚Äôre playing games and want a wireless set, I don‚Äôt think this is the right one, it‚Äôs just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don‚Äôt even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven‚Äôt encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let‚Äôs talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you‚Äôre going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review.¬†\n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it‚Äôs there in the right quantity with average speed. It‚Äôs not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don‚Äôt hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn‚Äôt rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren‚Äôt fatiguing and they never become hot, and I‚Äôd say that they‚Äôre not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn‚Äôt fatiguing but there‚Äôs some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some ‚ÄúS‚Äù sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don‚Äôt really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn‚Äôt very spacious, but it‚Äôs okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I‚Äôd say but no true bad words to spend here either.¬†\n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I‚Äôd say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons:¬†\n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äù sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they‚Äôre performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it‚Äôs the smarter choice between the two if you don‚Äôt wanna charge it as frequently as you‚Äôd do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that‚Äôs objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it‚Äôs a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not ‚Äúbad‚Äù per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren‚Äôt big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúperceived‚Äù clarity‚Äù up top but it doesn‚Äôt really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I‚Äôd say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Œ©) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Œ©), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

    "selftext": "***TL;DR:*** *Yes, they're that good. For me they hit all the sweet spots with ideal compromises for the price/package. The best ANC/Wireless/BT headphone I have heard. I think they deserve the hype in their neutral / out-of-the-box EQ. They cherry pick lots of great qualities and bundle them into a class defining package. I am happy they hit the price point they do. They feel made with love and care for anyone that loves high quality sound. They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

It's a tool to create personalized EQ settings for your headphone on your head, and it's focused on convenience and usability.\n\nWe have now created a how-to video that shows how we (the creators) use the tool. The approach shown in the video is only one of multiple possible ways and there's more information in the Q&A section.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo)\n\nNote: You will need an EQ app like EqualizerAPO / Peace or EqMac to comfortably listen to music and other things on your system -- the Owliophile tool is only there to help you find the right settings.\n\nWe're planning to make more videos on the technical / theoretical background, as well as explaining all details of the tool, so if you're curious you are welcome to subscribe to the channel. Anyway, I hope this first one serves as a good and practical introduction to the topic of personalized equalization for some of you.\n\nCheers!  \nOwlio",

    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

    "selftext": "I want to preface saying that I'm a really casual user about headphones. My only purchases were some Tin Hifi T2 Plus years ago (that I can't fit properly) and my Sennheiser HD599 that I've been using for some years. I don't have a DAC and all that stuff, all is drived by my Asus motherboard on my PC\n\nI mainly use my HD599 for gaming and music listening from time to time and recently I decided to try some EQ settings on Equalizer APO with Peace using the AutoEQ presets\n\nI tried all these presets on the Harman target, but the crinacle ones sounds kinda similar to the oratory and the rtings sounds different from the others.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ceow6wu5vtxf1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d8109aa512d516ffadcd13c41e657a4c13b5bea\n\nCould someone point me out what can I expect about this EQ presets? I tried searching myself with no sucess, and because I'm a real casual user, I can't point the differences on them\n\nI would like to know and understand if one preset it's more focused on bass, or try to bring the mids to the front and such. Some general characteristics so I can understand what are their differences",

Now, just disregard audio quality completely. I'm just talking noise cancelling with ANC. How is it that airpod pro 3s beat the xm5 in noise cancellation with ANC on? I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

But upon sitting at demo area, having exchanged a few pleasantries with the staff, their attitude quickly changed. Asking them about anything would yield a response that came across unbothered or sometimes annoyed. Sometimes the staff outright ignored me, completely unbothered, clicking away on his phone/laptop when the room is completely silent and just the two of us, when I made a comment or asked a question. \n\nI've gotten responses like \"Huh? Oh. Yeah, ok.\", \"Pick something else then.\"\n\nIt's not even just what they say or don't say, but it's how they say it. They really made me feel like they didn't want my business. Oddly they would only ever respond if you asked about the price. For such a niche hobby for enthusiasts, the staff at Addicted to Audio seem incredibly uninterested in audio at all. \n\nThe audio hobby is already so niche, rarely ever coming by others who share the interest. I'd like to enter an enthusiast store and meet other enthusiasts who actually care and want to share their love of audio. \n\nIf the staff are so uninterested then they should just work at Harvey Norman or JB HiFi where customers actually don't want to engage the staff. \n\nI'm an experienced audiophile with a fairly deep appreciation and budget. I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment. The local audiophile circle feel the same way and have since chosen to bring their business to Minidisc instead. ",

    "title": "Lets talk about the new Edition XV",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let‚Äôs talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I‚Äôve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me ‚Äî like being wrapped in honey. You‚Äôll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It‚Äôs thick, elastic, and feels like it‚Äôs hugging the sides of your ears. It‚Äôs not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It‚Äôs the wet, creamy kind ‚Äî like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro‚Äôs bass FEELS more aggressive. It‚Äôs like a scholar delivering an insult ‚Äî refined, yet every word cuts deep. There‚Äôs more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there ‚Äî it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I‚Äôm just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that‚Äôs not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY¬† different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That‚Äôs not necessarily good or bad ‚Äî it‚Äôs all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they‚Äôre more refined but also smoother ‚Äî which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro‚Äôs vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason ‚Äî it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks ‚Äî songs like city pop ‚Äî take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I‚Äôd describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you‚Äôre tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That‚Äôs what the Edition XV feels like. It won‚Äôt shock you, it won‚Äôt thrill you ‚Äî it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft ‚Äî no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it‚Äôs the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage ‚Äî the Edition XV‚Äôs lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro‚Äôs stage is even smaller, but it doesn‚Äôt have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it‚Äôs the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it‚Äôs Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth‚Äôs do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it‚Äôs a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it‚Äôs very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn‚Äôt too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren‚Äôt for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can‚Äôt wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I‚Äôll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it‚Äôs a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x‚Äôs is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock‚Äîpretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can‚Äôt imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They‚Äôre far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans.

(Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it‚Äôs just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they‚Äôve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I‚Äôd dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up‚Äôs as well I‚Äôd love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

    "title": "Kefine Delci AE: When spectacularity becomes art",
    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I‚Äôve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn‚Äôt stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65‚Ç¨**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn‚Äôt have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle‚Ä¶ but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn‚Äôt have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone‚Äôs auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn‚Äôt tangle, and doesn‚Äôt pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don‚Äôt know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn‚Äôt find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn‚Äôt fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone‚Äôs intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn‚Äôt the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don‚Äôt feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors‚Äô tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don‚Äôt know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can‚Äôt believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos‚Äô very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn‚Äôt the highest resolution experience I‚Äôve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it‚Äôs the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn‚Äôt the best for purists since listening wasn‚Äôt fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don‚Äôt want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I‚Äôve tested. At least up to the **100‚Ç¨/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what‚Äôs the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn‚Äôt perfect. In fact, technically, it‚Äôs inferior to two other competitors in its price range I‚Äôve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I‚Äôm not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn‚Äôt hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

    "title": "Myer Audio SLIIVO SL224 Earphones Review",
    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe radius of the metal part of the sound guide is 6.25 mm. in the thick end part and 5.55 in the main part.\n\nThe outer inserts are made of natural mother-of-pearl placed under a layer of transparent plastic. Mother-of-pearl mysteriously shimmers in the light, and small defects only emphasize the natural origin of the material and are not noticeable in reality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uo0fwmj7ruxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4057aa4590b0ca2e33a8365e4e610daf0a21b1b8\n\nThe connector pad is flat, it is slightly recessed into the housing. The compensation hole is covered with a plastic grate fused into the housing.\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore ‚Äì [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics ‚Äì they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Œ© and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Œ©.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones ‚Äì [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound‚Ä¶ I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!",

Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with.

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

Either it sounded dull, the UX was bad or I just plain didn't like using it.\n\nHaving tried mostly chinese stuff, I finally wanted to try something completly different and it paid off.\n\nMy recent purchase was the Lake People G101 a simple, anlog headphone amp. No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240‚Ç¨, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits. Let's hope I don't need them but it's nice to see thought given to that part of the device. Also designed and built in Germany for my fellow r/BuyFromEU volks.\n\nThe DAC on-top is a Topping D10s, one of the first HiFi products I got and it runs great too. What can I say: It's a DAC. Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice. But other than that I am so happy and juet feel peace with this setup. It sounds great, has lots of power and will hopefully last me a long time.",

Why hasn't Apple updated their Encoder since I'm wonder If that the Issue. \n\nLAME 3.100 at V2 - Shockly robust with IDM/Noise with only the worst cases displaying pre-echo. Noticed that the VBR mode suffers from bit starvation where It sounds like your typical 128kbps encode. \n\nHelix MP3 V5.2.4 at V120 - Blows LAME out the water at ~192kbps with It being fully transparent on IDM/Noise & lacks the VBR bit starvation issue, You even have the -T switch to force a higher bit rate target within 192kbps. \n\nVorbis at Q6 - The ugliest at IDM/Noise as It replaces everything with a puffy wind like sound you need 384kbps average to fix It. Like with AAC only decent at 256kbps VBR. \n\nOpus 1.5.2 at 192kbps - Is transparent but only 99% of the time gotten Ugly smearing on two Noise tracks & pre-echo on a IDM track.

What funnier this Is at 160kbps VBR & It codec based on the even older MP2 format(Subband coding) yet It seems to give MDCT lossy a real run for It money. It more like a inverse lossless codec since when sections or whole songs are 384 ~ 960kbps they are treated no different to FLAC.

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

Feet are cheapish metal \"isolation\" spikes. Those were the nicest looking solution for getting the necessary ventilation clearance between the two amps.\n\nThe DX5 II is a really neat little box full of features and with all the power I need. Moved the previous Topping E50/L50 stack to my study. No need for any other DAC/amps until something breaks.\n\nThe Antares is for my Stax and the hopefully soon repaired Sennheiser HE-60. More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800. My impression is that it does something pleasing to the staging and shaves off most of the micro details, which can be relaxing depending on the mood and music. Despite recommendations it is  not good with the HD580 which, to me, already lacks resolution. Need to set up an A/B comparison one of these days to see if I am just imagining things. \n\nHeadphones are Stax Lambda Nova Basic, which I got for cheap with one of the utter crap Stay entry level amps.",

Personally, I‚Äôm not a believer in all that snake oil ‚Äî people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don‚Äôt buy it. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I‚Äôve always thought that if there‚Äôs any difference, it‚Äôs basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time ‚Äî I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a ‚Äúbigger soundstage,‚Äù I just assume it‚Äôs because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I‚Äôm open-minded ‚Äî I‚Äôll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that‚Äôs matched, everything else ‚Äî bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging ‚Äî sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I‚Äôm out. Either they‚Äôre trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don‚Äôt. In either case, their opinions don‚Äôt mean much to me anymore, because I can‚Äôt hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let‚Äôs talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn‚Äôt tell exactly what at first, but it didn‚Äôt feel like my imagination. After more testing ‚Äî switching headphones, replaying the same tracks ‚Äî I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head ‚Äî especially those higher notes ‚Äî in a way the K7 doesn‚Äôt. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that‚Äôs somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it‚Äôs like their voice locks into one spot ‚Äî more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this ‚Äî it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you ‚Äî same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat‚Äôs not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer‚Äôs right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste ‚Äî some benefit from that extra space, some don‚Äôt. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** ‚Äî *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn‚Äôt huge, but it‚Äôs there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It‚Äôs actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it‚Äôs slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less ‚Äúexciting.‚Äù The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah ‚Äî I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It‚Äôs pricey, and there‚Äôs no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat‚Äôs my honest take.",

    "title": "CVJ Neko: CVJ Neko: bass that hits and voices that whisper.",
    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n‚Üí Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n‚Üí Punchy bass.  \n‚Üí Delicious female vocals.  \n‚Üí Soundstage above average.  \n‚Üí No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n‚Üí DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n‚Üí If you are a purist, stay away.  \n‚Üí Mids somewhat soft.  \n‚Üí Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30‚Ç¨/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a ‚Äúmore and better.‚Äù\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:**¬†present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:**¬†this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:**¬†here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:**¬†somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:**¬†maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:**¬†with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:**¬†substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:**¬†too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:**¬†I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:**¬†at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:**¬†placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:**¬†keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:**¬†could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:**¬†testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko‚Äôs character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos‚Äô voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:**¬†testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once‚Ä¶ I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:**¬†dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:**¬†not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:**¬†paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:**¬†I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it‚Äôs unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you have fun‚Äù vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

However ALOT of problems have risen up Rn.\n\nThe audio sounds HORRIBLE! Its muffled, with me having to equalize the hell out of the headphone to sound the similar to my IEMs or the AKG K44.

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/hzhh291a74yf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1330b369663156fd2593bc89c456bd2a8ca3e1fb\n\nHi everyone:\n\nI used both the QCC Pro and BTD700 dongles to test various codecs (aptX, aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC) and noticed some distortion in the high frequencies‚Äîespecially with piano tracks. This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn‚Äôt test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can‚Äôt go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle ‚Äî I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would‚Äôve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn‚Äôt have a mobile app, but there‚Äôs one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn‚Äôt update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they‚Äôre very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side ‚Äî the QCC Pro‚Äôs mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro‚Äôs design but prefer the BTD700‚Äôs price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they‚Äôre an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey‚Äôre extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I‚Äôm very sensitive ‚Äî even picky ‚Äî about anything pressing on my head (I can‚Äôt stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw‚Äôs traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft ‚Äî genuinely reminiscent of Herm√®s leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Herm√®s bags, you‚Äôll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not good for solo performances ‚Äî I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it‚Äôs more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced ‚Äî I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water‚Ä¶ and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

It was just very farty and anything close to normal volume made it sound extremely sad. I am not joking when I say this but an HD600 with a subbass shelf has cleaner bass. IT CANNOT DO SUBBASS EVEN STOCK.\n\nMids: actually not too bad, nothing to write home about. I honestly don't know what to say about it except for its mediocre and VERY IN YOUR FACE. Suicideboys was the only artist that sounded okay.\n\nHighs: OH BOY IT GETS WORSE, there is something real nasty goin on in the low-mid treble. This was something that could not be fixed with mods or whatever I did. Maybe it's a reflection or resonance from the driver cover? I tried everything in the book and I could not fix it.\nBut anyway, the treble wasn't fun. It was a hazy mess, any track sounded sharp and not detailed at the same time. I can accept being slightly piercing IF there is a good amount of detail output.\n\nThe baseline is that there are WAYYY better cans at the same price. I have also seen DMS recommending them and I can sort of understand why since his listening volume is extremely low (compared to mine) and doesn't run into the same distortion problems (I think).",

The XM6 feels smoother and less fatiguing during long listening sessions, but I also noticed a slight drop in bass impact compared to the XM5.\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe PX7 S3, on the other hand, is a completely different story. The sound quality is amazing ‚Äî much richer, more powerful, and detailed than both the XM5 and XM6. It‚Äôs the kind of sound that makes you feel the music. But because of its strong low end and bright highs, it becomes tiring after a few songs.\n\nSo basically:\nThe XM6 is relaxing, but lacks emotion.\nThe PX7 S3 is exciting, but that excitement can be exhausting.\nAnd honestly, the ANC difference between the XM6 and PX7 S3 is on another level ‚Äî the XM6's noise cancelling is just miles ahead.\nNow I'm stuck between comfort, emotion, and practicality.\n\nIf you were in my position - already owning the XM5\n‚Äî which one would you pick as your second pair?\nWould you go for the PX7 S3 for that immersive, emotional sound even if it's fatiguing over time, or would you choose the XM6 for its balance, better ANC, and overall smoother experience ?

    "selftext": "So I previously had upgraded from some generic brand headphones to the JBL Quantum One's. They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

But this is my office, and although I do have a nice stereo system here, headphones are sometimes more adequate. I've recently got a pair of Sennheiser HD600s, powered by a Fiio K11 R2R, and they work fine.\n\n  \nPerhaps my questions are more on the subject of headphones than of this one in particular, maybe. I use Sonus Faber Sonettos here, and I absolutely love them. The headphones just seem \"constrained\" maybe. I am not good at describing such things. But they seem to be lacking \"openness\" and some space. Don't know if it's the HD600s, the amp, or just the nature of headphones themselves, being placed in your head for example, I know their weight may be a factor, I don't know, just not feeling it.\n\n  \nHope any of you can relate and give me some advice, thank you all!",

    "selftext": "I feel lied to! All over this sub, and other IEM subs have repeatedly said, \"If you can get it loud enough then you don't need an amp!\" LIES!\n\nI went to a headphone shop today, I brought my own dongle DAC/Amp. Tried a bunch of headphones. You know what? Yes I could get the demo units up to par listening volume. It was loud enough. Didn't even need to get to 80% volume for it to be loud. Huh, sounds decent.\n\nThen the guy said to try it with a dedicated desktop amp. I plugged it in, and lo' and behold, the audio is richer, soundstage is bigger, the headphones came ALIVE. Before, it was tinny and flat, but loud enough. Crazily, with the amp, the volume was actually set lower. Did I volume match? No, but I didn't need to because I could hear the difference before I got to the same volume. \n\nI always turn the volume down to zero before swapping anything. Before I even got halfway there to the same volume, I could already hear how much richer the sound was.\n\nFYI, it was a Samsung S22 Ultra -> Luxury & Precision W4 -> 4.4mm Out, this was the dongle DAC setup that actually sounds quite phenomenal for IEMs, but with headphones the W4 simply could not produce enough juice to *really drive* the headphones (HiFiMAN Edition XS). \n\nSo, do you need an amp if you are using headphones? The technical answer is no, but if you want to get the best out of it, then yes you do.",

It's a tool to create personalized EQ settings for your headphone on your head, and it's focused on convenience and usability.\n\nWe have now created a how-to video that shows how we (the creators) use the tool. The approach shown in the video is only one of multiple possible ways and there's more information in the Q&A section.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br84IVOk5oo)\n\nNote: You will need an EQ app like EqualizerAPO / Peace or EqMac to comfortably listen to music and other things on your system -- the Owliophile tool is only there to help you find the right settings.\n\nWe're planning to make more videos on the technical / theoretical background, as well as explaining all details of the tool, so if you're curious you are welcome to subscribe to the channel. Anyway, I hope this first one serves as a good and practical introduction to the topic of personalized equalization for some of you.\n\nCheers!  \nOwlio",

I'm nearly 33 I've noticed some odd changes. \n\nApple AAC at Q91 - Still notice break up in Dark ambient, Added Clicks/buzz in Noise, Pre-echo In IDM/Electro. Why hasn't Apple updated their Encoder since I'm wonder If that the Issue. \n\nLAME 3.100 at V2 - Shockly robust with IDM/Noise with only the worst cases displaying pre-echo. Noticed that the VBR mode suffers from bit starvation where It sounds like your typical 128kbps encode. \n\nHelix MP3 V5.2.4 at V120 - Blows LAME out the water at ~192kbps with It being fully transparent on IDM/Noise & lacks the VBR bit starvation issue, You even have the -T switch to force a higher bit rate target within 192kbps. \n\nVorbis at Q6 - The ugliest at IDM/Noise as It replaces everything with a puffy wind like sound you need 384kbps average to fix It. Like with AAC only decent at 256kbps VBR. \n\nOpus 1.5.2 at 192kbps - Is transparent but only 99% of the time gotten Ugly smearing on two Noise tracks & pre-echo on a IDM track. You need 384kbps to fix It...ugh.\n\nMusepack at Q5 - 100% transparent never found anything In my collection of Noise/IDM & Noise metal that breaks It. It VBR mode Is the most advanced of all, In prurient & Ryoji Ikeda's - Dataplex the average bit rate was 580 ~ 960kbps. What funnier this Is at 160kbps VBR & It codec based on the even older MP2 format(Subband coding) yet It seems to give MDCT lossy a real run for It money. It more like a inverse lossless codec since when sections or whole songs are 384 ~ 960kbps they are treated no different to FLAC. You can do Q5.5 to get 192kbps If needed. \n\nStill view the detail pushing power of the ER4XR causing this.",

In some ways, they resemble the HE1000SE, though their soundstage feels much smaller compared to both the Sundara and the HEKSE. Interestingly, they pair wonderfully with the iBasso 260‚Äîto my ears, they sound even better through it than via the Mojo 2.\n\nOnce I save up, I‚Äôm considering getting the Hifiman Serenade amp/DAC to smooth out the HE1000SE‚Äôs sound, or perhaps investing in warmer headphones like ZMF.

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

    "selftext": "I got the Topping DX5 II a couple of months ago, and now got around to ordering some feet so that I can stack it on top of the High-Amp Antares. Feet are cheapish metal \"isolation\" spikes. Those were the nicest looking solution for getting the necessary ventilation clearance between the two amps.\n\nThe DX5 II is a really neat little box full of features and with all the power I need. Moved the previous Topping E50/L50 stack to my study. No need for any other DAC/amps until something breaks.\n\nThe Antares is for my Stax and the hopefully soon repaired Sennheiser HE-60. More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800. My impression is that it does something pleasing to the staging and shaves off most of the micro details, which can be relaxing depending on the mood and music. Despite recommendations it is  not good with the HD580 which, to me, already lacks resolution. Need to set up an A/B comparison one of these days to see if I am just imagining things. \n\nHeadphones are Stax Lambda Nova Basic, which I got for cheap with one of the utter crap Stay entry level amps.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2flmc5e914yf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=70db2ea529ba5f5b1230ac28b4d91c7ec2cfedce\n\nSo, I want to talk about DACs. Personally, I‚Äôm not a believer in all that snake oil ‚Äî people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don‚Äôt buy it. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I‚Äôve always thought that if there‚Äôs any difference, it‚Äôs basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time ‚Äî I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a ‚Äúbigger soundstage,‚Äù I just assume it‚Äôs because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I‚Äôm open-minded ‚Äî I‚Äôll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that‚Äôs matched, everything else ‚Äî bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging ‚Äî sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I‚Äôm out. Either they‚Äôre trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don‚Äôt. In either case, their opinions don‚Äôt mean much to me anymore, because I can‚Äôt hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let‚Äôs talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn‚Äôt tell exactly what at first, but it didn‚Äôt feel like my imagination. After more testing ‚Äî switching headphones, replaying the same tracks ‚Äî I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head ‚Äî especially those higher notes ‚Äî in a way the K7 doesn‚Äôt. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that‚Äôs somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it‚Äôs like their voice locks into one spot ‚Äî more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this ‚Äî it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you ‚Äî same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat‚Äôs not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer‚Äôs right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste ‚Äî some benefit from that extra space, some don‚Äôt. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** ‚Äî *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn‚Äôt huge, but it‚Äôs there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It‚Äôs actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it‚Äôs slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less ‚Äúexciting.‚Äù The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah ‚Äî I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It‚Äôs pricey, and there‚Äôs no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat‚Äôs my honest take.",

    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n‚Üí Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n‚Üí Punchy bass.  \n‚Üí Delicious female vocals.  \n‚Üí Soundstage above average.  \n‚Üí No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n‚Üí DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n‚Üí If you are a purist, stay away.  \n‚Üí Mids somewhat soft.  \n‚Üí Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30‚Ç¨/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a ‚Äúmore and better.‚Äù\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:**¬†present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:**¬†this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:**¬†here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:**¬†somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:**¬†maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:**¬†with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:**¬†substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:**¬†too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:**¬†I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:**¬†at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:**¬†placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:**¬†keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:**¬†could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:**¬†testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko‚Äôs character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos‚Äô voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:**¬†testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once‚Ä¶ I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:**¬†dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:**¬†not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:**¬†paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:**¬†I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it‚Äôs unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you have fun‚Äù vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

    "selftext": "Hello everybody! so Long time ago (2016-17) my brother bought the AKG K44 and I remember it‚Äôs sounding incredible. He also had a Scarlet 2I2 sound card.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a year that we dont talk anymore and i wanted to buy the same by buying an AKG product. And so i went in with the AKG K72. However ALOT of problems have risen up Rn.\n\nThe audio sounds HORRIBLE! Its muffled, with me having to equalize the hell out of the headphone to sound the similar to my IEMs or the AKG K44. (I use the Onboard Motherboard sound card ‚Äúgigabyte P110-D3‚Äù for more info) \neven then it screws my video/audio editing precision up,(volume control, General Equalization etc.) making me double check my videos twice with my IEMs. \n\nWhen I equalize it, i balance the bass but still give the cheap feeling  of when you listen to something with a bit of Bassy, the high and mids just go ‚Äúlow volume‚Äù mode. (Not sure that might be a sound card problem idk im new to the audio world)\n\nI was wondering if this is a fake headphone or not? And just general tips on what to do?\nThe headband just lost its stitches on its inner rubber and i had to stitch it myself (after 2 weeks of use btw).\nThe printing has some minor smudges on the font. As if they didnt paint it well, The cable feels nice tho and does not feel fake‚Ä¶ but overall feels sketchy.\n\n(Im from iran and we dont have customer support here so i cant do anything but just look for tips here. Due to sanctions eveything is twice as expensive and banned here. Even buying stuff from amazon.)\n\nI‚Äôve heared that if i buy a sound card (UE Volt 1) it will make it sound better, but im not sure‚Ä¶ should it? Imean my brother‚Äôs K44 sounded amazing no matter what u plugged it into.\n\nSo what do i do?\n\nStart editing with my IEMs again?\nBuy the UE VOLT 1 sound card?\nGet a razor black shark V2X?\njust stop using the K72 entirely?\nI really dont know what to do tbh‚Ä¶ ",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

I already have a PS5 and a Nintendo Switch, and since I don‚Äôt own any Windows devices, I thought getting a Steam Deck would be a cheap and practical way (especially since it‚Äôs handheld) to access my Steam library, which I really miss from time to time.\n\nHowever‚Ä¶ this thing is f\\*cking **HUGE**. I‚Äôd seen it plenty of times on YouTube and in reviews, but I never expected it to be *this* big. It‚Äôs a very cool gadget, but it honestly tired out my hands and arms after about 15-20 minutes of playtime. I don‚Äôt know if my hands are just too small (never thought they were), but even using the joysticks felt like an effort.\n\nSo my question is: **do you have any tips to improve usability?** At this point, I‚Äôm even open to suggestions like, ‚ÄúDude, do these exercises so your Deck-playing muscles get stronger‚Äù, lol.\n\nThanks a lot.",

    "title": "How to 'Jailbreak' SteamDeck, or alter (or find workarounds for) Gaming Mode control scheme?",
    "selftext": "Hello there, tl;dr at the end of the post, but a bit of backstory to start.\n\nAbout a month ago I bought a Lenovo Legion Go S (with SteamOS), as at the time it was much easier to get hold of than an actual Steam Deck, and even though I would have preferred a Steam Deck, so far I've loved it. There are a few things which annoy me, like navigating Desktop Mode using the touchscreen or joystick-as-mouse, or the weirdness of navigating Gaming Mode in general, but it's mostly fine.\n\nAnyway, it was my younger brother's birthday this past weekend, and since he loves paradox and city building games, last week I decided to order him the 1TB OLED Steam Deck. There were a few delivery issues, but it arrived yesterday, and both my brother and I were pretty excited to start using it. After the experience of helping him set it up though, I have to say I'm kind of disappointed.\n\nThe OLED screen quality is amazing, I love all the different input options available, and navigating Desktop Mode is much nicer than the Lenovo with the trackpads and all that.\n\nBut what infuriates me is Gaming Mode, which is just a misery to use. Why did they make it so you can't change the control scheme at all, so there's no way for you to alter things such that you don't have to hold down the steam button to use the right trackpad as a mouse? Why can't you use the left trackpad to scroll, something you inevitably have to do lots of if you're trying to navigate the home store page, or your library, or the steam workshop? They let you use the cursor & middle-wheel scroll functions of an external mouse connected via bluetooth or usb, so why not just allow the trackpads as well?\n\nOf course, all this just means that the experience of navigating Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck is identical to the experience I had with the Lenovo Legion Go S (though the Steam Deck also tends to be a bit more dysfunctional in terms of the system hanging and games crashing for some reason), so you might ask why I'm complaining. Well, my brother sort of crystallised my thoughts on the issue last night when we were talking about it. He said that the Steam Deck was so close to being an ideal experience in so many ways, but there was always some sort of small issue that popped up and created unnecessary friction which stopped it from being so. That awareness that the experience could be so much better if things were tweaked just a little bit is intensely frustrating.\n\nOf course, none of this would be an issue if it were possible to run things in Desktop Mode all the time, but I've read in several places that if you want to maximise performance, you sort of *have* to run games in Gaming Mode due to some optimisations Valve have implemented plus the GameScope wrapper. Well, that plus the fact that the in-game Steam Overlay in Desktop Mode is absolutely awful, and if the game doesn't make use of the trackpads for their mouse functions, then you can't use them in the Steam Overlay either (if the game is windowed and you use the touchscreen to click outside the window & defocus from the game window, then you can use the trackpads, but why not just make it so switching to the in-game Steam Overlay enables the use of the trackpad mice by default?). Also, I've heard Desktop Mode limits the amount of CPU threads your games can make use of, but I'm not sure how true that is.\n\n(tl;dr, actual question starts here)\n\nWhich leads me to the question I put in this post's title: is there any way, via 'Jailbreaking' or otherwise, it would be possible for me remove the block Valve put on Gaming Mode making use of the left & right trackpads as a scroll wheel & mouse cursor respectively? Since they let you use external mouse input in Gaming Mode, maybe some way to make Steam think the trackpads are an external input source or something? Or maybe it might be possible at least to remap one of the back L4/R4 L5/R5 buttons into a toggle for the 'steam button is being held down' input?\n\nAnd if not, is there a way I can get the Desktop Mode to have similar performance to Gaming Mode so my brother and I don't have to use it?",

    "selftext": "Been playing on PC for many years, and steam deck since it came out. For a couple of years now I've been using my PC like a console. It's in the living room hooked up to the TV and I've been using a controller. I used to have my PC at a desk but now I work at a job where I'm at a desk all day so that's the last thing I want to do. \n\nRecently I got a PS5 in preparation for GTA 6. As I was messing around with it I thought \" why have a PC now?\" My PC is pretty powerful but I'm not a huge nut for max performance and fidelity anymore. Since I'm already playing games mostly on the couch with a controller, why not just get rid of the PC and keep the PS5?\n\nI will still have access to my steam library through the steam deck which I use quite often. Any games that are more demanding I can use the PS5 for. \n\nIf I need a computer for anything other than gaming, I can use the steam deck. I currently have it hooked up to a dock on a desk to monitors like a computer anyway. I also have a pretty cheap laptop just in case. \n\nI'm trying to think of any reasons to keep the PC but I can't given my scenario. Thoughts?",

I went through every monthly chart Valve has released (August 2022 - present) and gave each rank a point value. The number one game is worth ten points, two is nine, three is eight, etc. I added them up and sorted them by year as well as a total for all years. It is kind of interesting to see which games have been consistent and which have not. For those who do not want to click the link I'll share the top 10 here.  \n\n  \n1. Stardew Valley  \n\n2. Elden Ring  \n\n3. Baldur's Gate 3  \n\n4. Vampire Survivors  \n\n5. Balatro  \n\n6. Cyberpunk 2077  \n\n7. Red Dead Redemption 2  \n\n8. Grand Theft Auto V  \n\n9. Hogwarts Legacy  \n\n10.

You can use Waydroid to simulate an android device (if you have not already) and download/update Minecraft there. Run it from Waydroid (works in Game Mode & Desktop Mode) and it will be on the newest update.

I've tried the solutions to these other issues and I still have the same problem. If there is already a post on other solutions to this, please let me know and direct me to that post.\n\nOccasionally (very often but not all the time) when I wake my steam deck from sleep, the wifi is not connected. If I try to go in and manually connect to a network, it shows no available networks.\n\nIt is not limited to just one network. It happens at work and at home. As I said above, I've tried solutions like toggling the developer mode wifi power management. Same issues happen whether it's toggles on or off.\n\nI recently went to the system update channel and change it to beta. The issue still happens. \n\nThe only solution to get my networks back on is to reset my steam deck. When I reset the deck, everything is normal and working fine. Until the next time I put it to sleep. It's hit or miss. It doesn't happen every time.\n\nI feel like it's most common when it's asleep for a longer period of time (close to an hour) or when I'm switching between networks. I use our company wifi inside the building, but when I go outside, I'll switch to my phones hot spot. The issue is most common at work. When I get back home I'll turn it on (today for example) and the network is unavailable. When I'm home and on my home wifi, I don't notice the problem as much, but that may have to do with the fact that it doesnt sleep as long as it does between breaks at work etc. ",

My question is: has anyone run either Lego Racers game on Steam Deck?   \n  \nI retain the CD-ROMs for them, if that at all helps (LR2 required that the disc to be inserted to play the game back in the day).

And a lot of care went into making it work on Steam Deck's Desktop Mode without disabling the read-only file system.

Some glasses have built-in cameras that make 6DoF possible. We can also use a webcam to offer these features (see the next section for how this can be done with OpenTrack). XR Gaming and Breezy's anchoring effects need to be updated to support this, and then the GUI/configuration options (e.g. screen distance and size) need to be made more clear within that context.\n\n**My driver already supports receiving OpenTrack UDP data as an alternative input source, which opens the door for things like:**\n\n* Using Breezy Desktop features on a remote machine\n* 6DoF features -- a low-res webcam works really well with OpenTrack's NeuralNet module.\n* Drift correction using a complimentary 3DoF source.\n* Providing 3DoF and 6DoF support for *any* glasses (not just the currently supported brands and models) with a webcam and OpenTrack's NeuralNet module\n\n# Wrapping up\n\n**Note**: Breezy Desktop is fully open source, but does [switch to a paid model](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#breezy-desktop-pricing-productivity-tier) after 2 trial months have ended, with free options available. Just a heads up so that doesn't catch anyone off guard.\n\n**Want to stay updated?** I post more regularly [on my Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/watercanhydrate), [Discord](https://discord.gg/aJT72wKpXn), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/wheaney), less frequently on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WayneHeaney), or you can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wheaney).\n\n**Ready to try it?** Get started with [Breezy KDE](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#kde-plasma-setup-beta), [XR Gaming](https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming#installation), or [Breezy GNOME setup](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#gnome-setup) and let me know what you think!",

A couple hours later I hit the button again to resume playing; and the screen went all wonky on me. It showed up slow, got real pixelated, and then proceeded to go black, not turning back on. \n\nI held the power button down for 10+ seconds to restart. When I did, the steam logo appeared, and then the screen went black, and then started going back and forth from being backlit to black, not showing any indication of the Steam app. \n\nI started troubleshooting by resetting firmware, holding the volume button down with the power button, did that with the 3-dot icon to try and reset the BIOS settings, and even tried rebooting from an older version. Nothing worked. \n\nI‚Äôm out of ideas on what to do, or who to turn to. So C‚Äômon Reddit. Show me what you gotttt! \n\n",

After she left I noticed my steam deck was pushed a bit and the usb cable was pulled out. This happened a couple weeks ago and the port still works fine. I just want to see if the amount of play in my port seems ok and also the usb c cable has some dents in it. I know usb c ports have some play and I always noticed the steam decks port was loose just not sure if it‚Äôs worst and I should order a new cable.\n\nThanks \n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/Qgz1l7o_JlM?si=el3hvrLsJ7xFQi3g\n\n\n",

Was on PC RPGs in the 90s but didn‚Äôt do much since then until 2020 when I got a switch Lite, and 2022 when I got a gaming laptop. \n\nFirst impression of steam deck was a little underwhelming after all the rabid fanfare on YouTube.\n\n1. Ergonomics are fine? Feels like cheap plastic, which is fine given that‚Äôs what‚Äôs light and durable. But why everyone says this feels like a Mercedes? I found switch lite more comfortable.\n\n2. Software is fine? Why did it come with 100+ pieces of bloat despite reviewers saying no bloat? \n\n3. Only 7 of my ~30 steam games are verified.. I guess that was a little disappointing. Not super worried here as I‚Äôm sure most will play fine. But sort of a weird UX to see a folder saying only 7 of your games are good to go.\n\n4. It‚Äôs been a little rough adjusting to this format. Elden Ring text hard to read, Rogue Trader controls pretty unintuitive. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll work this out in time but it‚Äôs not been the super easy pick-up-and-go experience I foresaw.\n\nNot trying to hate just sharing honest first thoughts.",

Since I'm already playing games mostly on the couch with a controller, why not just get rid of the PC and keep the PS5?\n\nI will still have access to my steam library through the steam deck which I use quite often. Any games that are more demanding I can use the PS5 for. \n\nIf I need a computer for anything other than gaming, I can use the steam deck. I currently have it hooked up to a dock on a desk to monitors like a computer anyway. I also have a pretty cheap laptop just in case. \n\nI'm trying to think of any reasons to keep the PC but I can't given my scenario. Thoughts?",

    "selftext": "Just wanted to share my experience after 8 hours on Steam Deck ‚Äî Dakar Desert Rally actually runs pretty well once you tweak it a bit.\n\nAt first, I noticed some shuttering and framedrops, especially during races, but after adjusting graphics (lowering shadows, terrain, and view distance), the game became much smoother ‚Äî almost no more stutters!\n\nFor those getting fatal errors before starting Career Mode, here‚Äôs a small hack that works for me every time:\nBefore launching Career Mode, open Free Roam first, play for a few seconds, then go back and start Career. No more crashes after that.\n\nOverall, with the right GPU and graphics tweaks, the game is totally playable and enjoyable on Deck! ",

And a lot of care went into making it work on Steam Deck's Desktop Mode without disabling the read-only file system. The setup process takes less than 5 minutes and Breezy Desktop works really well with multiple virtual displays on Steam Deck's hardware.\n\n# Roadmap\n\nHere's what's still in the works.\n\n**6DoF features**\n\n6DoF allows you to \"lean in\" to see the screen more clearly or move about it. Some glasses have built-in cameras that make 6DoF possible. We can also use a webcam to offer these features (see the next section for how this can be done with OpenTrack). XR Gaming and Breezy's anchoring effects need to be updated to support this, and then the GUI/configuration options (e.g. screen distance and size) need to be made more clear within that context.\n\n**My driver already supports receiving OpenTrack UDP data as an alternative input source, which opens the door for things like:**\n\n* Using Breezy Desktop features on a remote machine\n* 6DoF features -- a low-res webcam works really well with OpenTrack's NeuralNet module.\n* Drift correction using a complimentary 3DoF source.\n* Providing 3DoF and 6DoF support for *any* glasses (not just the currently supported brands and models) with a webcam and OpenTrack's NeuralNet module\n\n# Wrapping up\n\n**Note**: Breezy Desktop is fully open source, but does [switch to a paid model](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#breezy-desktop-pricing-productivity-tier) after 2 trial months have ended, with free options available. Just a heads up so that doesn't catch anyone off guard.\n\n**Want to stay updated?** I post more regularly [on my Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/watercanhydrate), [Discord](https://discord.gg/aJT72wKpXn), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/wheaney), less frequently on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WayneHeaney), or you can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wheaney).\n\n**Ready to try it?** Get started with [Breezy KDE](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#kde-plasma-setup-beta), [XR Gaming](https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming#installation), or [Breezy GNOME setup](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#gnome-setup) and let me know what you think!",

The response was incredible, and thanks to all your feedback, the game now runs even smoother and feels much better to play.\n\nI‚Äôve improved joystick sensitivity, added clearer animated highlights for selections, fixed navigation issues, and polished several UI details.  \nFor the full changelog: [Changelog](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2352670/view/594038293962686548)  \nSteam Page:¬†[Arcadium - Space Odyssey](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352670/Arcadium__Space_Odyssey/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=steamdeck&utm_campaign=releasedate)\n\nAlso, Arcadium ‚Äì Space Odyssey officially releases January 2026, and you can try out the demo right now!  \nThanks again to everyone who tested and shared feedback; you genuinely helped make the game better.",

My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate. Please advise.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dik98j6336yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd4bbf8867ff80c1d200863bd763861ea8117c60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efo49k2636yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d1adf32542880f2121f73e03474a770ecb68305\n\n",

I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home.

I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue.

    "title": "New lighting setup questions",
    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n¬†\n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n¬†\n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n¬†\n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered).¬†\n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n¬†\n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Tr√•dfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n¬†\n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, we are working on something and I'd like to know your honest opinion, sort of a sense-check.\n\nIt's a tool (or rather a suite of tools) that guides you step by step through the process of building and maintaining a smart home. A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe‚Äôre still in development and not selling anything yet ‚Äî just trying to see if there‚Äôs real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

Basically if we have negative air pressure in the room I risk burning up my oven control units very quickly. As you can imagine this is expensive both to repair and both in time. Air pressure can be controlled with the facilitation of a make up air system and multiple exhaust fans that can be individually switched on and off. \n\nIdeally I‚Äôd have sensor that goes off and sounds an audible alarm if say there is too much negative air pressure so that the bakers can adjust things.\n\nDoes something like this exist ready to go out of the box?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'd be tearing my hair out if I had any left.  Thank you in advance.",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob ü§∑\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on¬†https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "title": "Should I get motorised roof blinds?",
    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate. Please advise.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dik98j6336yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd4bbf8867ff80c1d200863bd763861ea8117c60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efo49k2636yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d1adf32542880f2121f73e03474a770ecb68305\n\n",

The issue I am seeing with this is that the this will only work as long as my phone is within range of the lighbulbs. I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue. Had my phone on airplane mode during when the lights were supposed to turn on and they did. ",

Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n¬†\n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n¬†\n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n¬†\n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered).¬†\n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n¬†\n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Tr√•dfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n¬†\n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment.

Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2).

The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice.

This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate.

I checked and the Vaillant is 2 wired.\n\nI guess i need to replace both of them with smart thermostat but in other rooms i have radiators where I want to add smart valves.\n\nCan I turn my radiators on and off seperately if the smart thermostat upstairs is for example on 20¬∞c and i want another room 25¬∞c?\n\nCan i just replace the Vaillant downstairs? Remove the one upstairs and just use the smart valves on the radiators, or do i need to replace the one upstairs also?\n\nAny recommendations what and how to do? Any recommendations on products to use?\n\nSorry for the newb questions.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don‚Äôt support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äôve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man‚Ä¶ there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is ‚ÄúTHE SMARTEST‚Äù... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren‚Äôt essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it‚Äôs like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart homes‚Äù catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you‚Äôre running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit ‚Äúnerd level 3000‚Äù... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone‚Äôs found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I‚Äôm cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn‚Äôt depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

I‚Äôm not a complete noob as I‚Äôm pretty tech savvy, but here, I‚Äôm really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I‚Äôm not here and I didn‚Äôt plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it‚Äôs only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can‚Äôt connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I‚Äôve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn‚Äôt change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically‚Ä¶ but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn‚Äôt detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I‚Äôm missing ?

    "title": "Smart home Setup - internet issues",
    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed ‚Äì Entry ‚Äì Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "title": "Dark Apartment - need ideas / solutions",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

My question is what Hub has the most connectivity options to make sure I can get as many things talking as possible.\n\nThe options I can see that would work are\n\nAqara M3 - Seems like a solid all round option with matterr and Zigbee support\n\nAqara s1+ - this seems to require the M3 hub for matter support but also looks super clean and seems to support HA\n\nHome assistant Green - Not to sure on this but it seems to be an Rpi that works as a hub?\n\n,",

I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said ‚Äúno‚Äù and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

Thank you all so much, I really appreciate this community so much. \n\n\n\nHi all, thank you in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\n**Prior to our issues:** we have a Google Home and multiple brands/types of smart devices. All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don‚Äôt support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äôve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man‚Ä¶ there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is ‚ÄúTHE SMARTEST‚Äù... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren‚Äôt essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it‚Äôs like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart homes‚Äù catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you‚Äôre running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit ‚Äúnerd level 3000‚Äù... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone‚Äôs found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I‚Äôm cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn‚Äôt depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

Great. But I still can‚Äôt connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I‚Äôve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox.

It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I‚Äôm missing ?

I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I‚Äôm ready to just go wired where I can. It‚Äôs inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it‚Äôs hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can‚Äôt set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can‚Äôt set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I‚Äôm not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don‚Äôt have info on any wired then I‚Äôll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while.

    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed ‚Äì Entry ‚Äì Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "title": "Bluetti is finally getting a official Smart Home Integration!",
    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don‚Äôt support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äôve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man‚Ä¶ there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is ‚ÄúTHE SMARTEST‚Äù... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren‚Äôt essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it‚Äôs like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart homes‚Äù catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you‚Äôre running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit ‚Äúnerd level 3000‚Äù... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone‚Äôs found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I‚Äôm cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn‚Äôt depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

    "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nWinter is coming and mornings are getting darker every day and they will be in my neck of woods for the next 4-monhts. I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

I was thinking something simple rather than lots of buttons, ideally like if you double tap or triple tap a button it loads one of your lighting presets.  I know you can get very expensive smart displays/switches that have 'moods' and 'scene etc on it, but I want something budget friendly that I can program. Would be open to using NFC too.. or other work arounds. But something not involving an extra 'tag' would be ideal if possible.\n\nCan it be done with standard smart switches?",

    "selftext": "BLUF:  Need advice on how to sync specific calendar (individual ones) appointments between my personal & work email accounts.  The way I used to do it randomly stopped working in recent months.  I'm not sure if a setting on my iPhone got boogered up or something on my corporate Outlook changed but when I send appointments to myself it won't show up on my work email. I also tested sending one from my work to personal email and that works fine... \n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating how I used to do this, but I noticed recently that when I share calendar appointments with my work email (Office 365 account) from my personal iCloud/iPhone, they aren't forwarded to my company Outlook account.  I add my work email address as an invitee, but it never receives/displays the appointment.   Historically I used to do this a while back so not sure why it's not working.\n\nStrangely, if I invite a personal outlook account (like my wife's Hotmail), this works fine and she gets the invite.  I'm sure there are differences in the backend between a corporate office 365 account and personal outlook, but I find it strange it's not even displaying the invite.  \n\nI receive plenty of images, emails, etc from my personal accounts all the time so I know it's not a matter of it being blocked. \n\nNote:  I don't put personal details, medical information, etc in the calendar items.  For example, if it's a doctor's appt, it will say \"Med Appt\" and I generally will put the address.  If I ever developed a specialty thing where the address might over-share something I wouldn't put that in there but overall, this works for things I need to block out on my calendar, which can get complicated some weeks.",

    "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve run into a pretty strange situation with my Lenovo Legion 5 Pro, and I‚Äôd appreciate any insights from the community.\n\nLast year, my laptop‚Äôs display suddenly went blank while I was using it ‚Äî the screen turned off, and the laptop would also power off by itself. I took it to a technician, and I was told that my GPU is gone so my laptop is dead now. Then i went to another renowned technician in my couuntry as there are no lenovo service centers over here thus i had to find the best technician possible and he said there was a fault with the RAM chip, which he repaired. He also mentioned that there might be a display-related issue on the motherboard and I have to change the LCD panel. But i didnt opt for it. \n\nAfter that, I started using a second monitor (external display) for months. Since my GPU wasn‚Äôt working, I uninstalled the GPU driver from Device Manager and used the laptop through CPU graphics only. It worked fine that way for quite a while.\n\nThen, a few days ago, something unbelievable happened ‚Äî my laptop‚Äôs built-in display suddenly came back to life, and the GPU started working again too. Even the fans kicked in properly, and everything seems normal now. It‚Äôs been three to four days, and it‚Äôs still running perfectly fine on the internal screen.\n\nThe only issues I‚Äôm facing now are:\n\nNo internal sound output\n\nOne key on the keyboard isn‚Äôt working\n\n\nOtherwise, everything‚Äôs smooth. Interestingly, the same thing happened about a month ago, but that time the display turned off again the very same day. This time, it‚Äôs stable for days.\n\nI‚Äôm just curious ‚Äî what could have caused this sudden recovery?\nCould it have been:\n\nA loose or corroded display cable (eDP) that somehow reconnected?\n\nA GPU solder joint temporarily reconnecting?\n\nOr some kind of BIOS/firmware self-repair or driver auto-reinitialization by Windows or Lenovo Vantage?\n\n\nAny technical insight or similar experiences would be great to hear.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The screen was turning on and the Aoc logo shows up not doesn't display anything else. I couldn't even access the monitor's built in menu. I tried unplugging the power and display port cords with no difference. I tried using it on my Xbox with the same result. I thought it could be a driver or firmware issue so I installed the latest driver from the manufacturer's website and that didn't change anything. I know it's not related to my PC because my 2nd monitor still works fine, and I bought another monitor from best buy recently that also works fine. I've tried different display cords too and nothing seems to work. Only after turning my monitor off and on 10-15 after my PC has booted will it display an image.",

    "title": "My PC is crashing 5 minutes into playing a specific game but I don't think it's the game's fault.",
    "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying that I'm by no means an expert in the field of PCs so excuse me if some of the wording I use is incorrect.\n\nI've had my PC for about 4 years and have gone through several issues but the one I'm facing now is making me want to give up. The PC wasn't new when I got it but it was a trusted friend of mine's old gaming PC, which he had fully rebuilt before giving it to me. \n\nThe first time facing any type of issue was when I started playing Borderlands 3 about 2 years ago. The game starting up would crash the PC (straight to blue screen). At first it would be occasional (1 in 4 launches) but it progressively got more and more frequent (9 in 10 launches). I know the game's optimization was crap so I chalked it up to being a mix between that and the fact that my PC was a pretty low performance build. What ended up fixing the issue was removing one of the two 16gb DDR4 ram sticks. So my next guess was that one of the sticks was faulty and since all my games were running fine with just one 16gb stick I didn't bother to look into it any further. \n\nMy build at the time was the following: \n\nWindows 11 \n\nAorus B550 Pro mobo \n\nAMD 5 Ryzen 2600 CPU \n\nPNY Gtx 1060 6gb GPU\n\nCorsair tx 750 80+ Gold PSU \n\nDidn't have any real issues after that, until about 3 weeks ago, when I started playing BF6. I knew my PC was severely underspecced for the game so I was ready to upgrade if need be. The game was running ok on my old build when setting everything to low and capping fps to 40, as long as I wasn't playing any large scale game modes (breakthrough and conquest provoked severe stuttering but rush and tdm were fine). Although performance was crap, the game was stable, no crashes of any sort. \n\nI ended up upgrading my CPU and GPU in order to fully enjoy the game and the idea was to get a future proof GPU and get a mid range CPU as my mobo is quite old and didn't want to invest too much in a part that might be upgraded again in the near future, if I changed mobo. So I went with a Gigabyte 5060Ti 16gb GPU and an AMD Ryzen 7 5700G CPU. I tried reinserting both 16gb ram sticks after the upgrade, which seemed to work okay. Bf6 was still stuttering in large scale game modes, but much less than before. I tried a friend's single 32gb stick and that seemed to work. My birthday was coming up so my friend bought me two new 16gb (faster) ram sticks and everything was looking good. \n\nPerformance was great but started getting occasional crashes every 2-3 hours of gameplay or so. Again, full PC crash, sometimes straight to blue screen, sometimes infinite reboot and always accompanied by an audio glitch (kind of like the sound of an air compressor filling it's reservoir) and only playing BF6 (other games I play include rdr2, chivalry 2, Elfen Ring, which have never caused issues). Manual force restart usually worked and I could play again for a few hours. \n\nI was running the game way under what my system is supposedly capable of but the crashes started getting more and more frequent. Checked CPU temp, averaged about 45‚Å∞ so that couldn't be it. I had updated my bios to F18i before upgrading GPU and CPU, drivers were up to date, windows up to date. Basically checked all of the usual suspects (that I know of). Did a bunch of troubleshooting looking into specific BF6 crash fixes and still haven't been successful. \n\nIt actually got to the point where my PC was starting to crash before I even opened steam. At first, the PC would fully crash on first startup after loging into window and arriving in desktop. 2nd start would work and I'd usually be able to play a couple of hours without any issues. Then it got worse, to the point where my PC would crash everytime I'd log into window. 30sec into opening desktop it would crash, often to a dark grey screen, sometimes even the manual power button wouldn't work. \n\nI ended up doing a clean install of windows 11 and at least my OS now seems to be stable. But the crashes on BF6 have actually gotten worse, PC crashes about 10-15 minutes into gameplay. Same crash as usual, full PC crash, although the crash isn't as abrupt as before. I'm usually able to speak with my friends on discord after the game crashes for about 1-2 minutes while the PC itself starts crashing, whereas before it used to just instantly crash everything. \n\nI tried disabling a few things in bios such as XMP, CPU performance Boost and a few other things. Upped the ram voltage to 1.35 as it was set to 1.25 (sticks are 1.35), lowered CPU clocking ratio from 38 to 35. Disabled steam overlay. Tried a bunch of other weird BF6 specific solutions without any success. \n\nLast thing I changed was setting the game's exe files to be compatible with an older version of windows and running them as admin, as that has somehow helped a few people. Also set the game to launch with dx11. Haven't had time to try it out since then so hopefully it fixes it but I somehow doubt that. I still need to try and launch the game as a window rather than borderless and I saw something about setting \"Enableglint\" to 0 in steam. The last thing I might try is reverting my bios to an older version.  \n\nI'm honestly quite close to getting a new motherboard and PSU, as they're the only two parts that haven't been swapped recently. \n\nSorry about the length of this post but I felt that the more context is given, the easier it is to diagnose. Thanks in advance for any suggestions. \n\nTLDR: BF6 is crashing my PC and I'm starting to lose my mind ",

Existing IPS router is corner of house with no way to run a cable to any edge of the house. \nMy idea was to use a secondary router placed near an external wall bridged to IPS router, then run cat5/6 to external building with AP or another router in there. Does anyone know if this works or is lilly to be feasible? \nAlso would a mesh set up inside the main building allow me to run cat5 from a mesh point to the external building. Can't find any information if these mesh kits can then support a physical cable to AP!\n\nFyi, EoP is not an option and WiFi boosters won't work inside the external building due to high level of insulation with foil!\n\nThanks.

I don't think that both my cpu and ram decided to fail at the same time, also there wasn't any short when I fumbled with the pins 2months ago, I managed to start the pc this Sunday don't ask me how I forgot, kept it idling for 10m no freeze or anything but after I turned it off, no longer started, I am in a cold room btw, there isn't any condensation on the board and if there is, that's why I'm heating up the board with a hair drier so it evaporates\n\nPlease help!

    "selftext": "I was playing a videogame yesterday in the evening, and all of a sudden my PC froze: no sound, no keyboard/mouse input, and the same image stuck on the screen.\nI turned it off by holding the power button, tried turning it back on normally, and it got stuck on the windows 11 spinning circle, with the motherboard's logo abode the spinning circle, and the keyboard wouldn't work (caps lock led not turning on/off).\nToday, I managed to go into the bios by pressing DEL key on boot (so keyboard works), and restore the default values. I then tried turning it back on, but still no success.\nAfter that, I rebooted again, and windows tried to load the automatic recovery, after it finishes loading it only shows a black screen, with the keyboard working (caps lock led works), but nothing else.\nI tried using a USB drive with the windows 11 media installation tool, but when I try to boot from that, I still see windows spinning circle, then black screen again (keyboard works).\nMy motherboard is an Asus PRIME H670-PLUS D4, with Q-LED lights for diagnostics, and those lights turn on and off as intended, and everything shows up correctly in the bios, so hardware should be fine?\nI already tried using only one stick of RAM, with each one, reseating the GPU and the GPU power connector, checking that the power plugs on the PSU are fully in, removing and putting back in the boot nvme, using a different video port on the graphics card, but I get the same result. Additionally, on the bios configuration page, I ran a storage check on the boot nvme, and it gave it a pass.\nThese are all the parts in my PC: https://it.pcpartpicker.com/list/KLssfy\n\nWhat can I do now? Please help me, it's been running flawlessly for more than 3 years, and now all of a sudden it doesn't work at all.\n\nEdit: I noticed another thing: I have 2 monitors, one HDMI, one DP. The video behaves the same way on both, but on the DP one, the monitor sometimes (not always) makes white noise when I power the PC on (I'm only using one at a time to diagnose).",

    "selftext": "I live in a rural area and have never had great internet I use some company called \"Smarter broadband\", I don't know the specifics but I have a satellite receiver and that uses what they've told me is a power over ethernet to connect to my router. I've always struggled with my NAT type in games for the past decade and recently it's gotten so ridiculous that I just can't stand it any more and feel like I'm going insane. \n\nI finally found a website that checked my nat type told me more than the vague \"open, moderate, strict\" NAT types and informed me of the term \"symmetric nat type\" which is supposedly what my internet is using and is what blocking me from connecting to anything and anyone from connecting to me. I know for sure this is nothing to do with my router because not only have I tried literally every single suggestion I've found on the internet but I can also plug my desktop directly into the LAN port on my POE and my computer is still seen as behind this \"symmetric nat\". As far as I can tell if this was a problem on my end with my router that should fix it right?\n\nWith that out of the way I call my ISP with all this information and they basically come back and tell me that not only do they supposedly not even use their own CGNAT, I can pay $10 a month extra for a static IP address that MAY resolve the issue, and also that I should upgrade my speed package (not the issue). Then he proceeds to ask if maybe it is a problem with the settings on my computer.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is does anybody know any way I could go about resolving this somehow? Is there a way I can somehow maybe configure the antenna? Is my ISP just lying to me?",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I'm sorry in advance for not originally heeding the very common calls for backing up important files. I doubt I'll ever forego making backups for the rest of my life after this.\n\nI've a 256 GB NVMe (UEFI and GPT) on my computer with Fedora 42 GNOME installed (BTRFS with ZSTD compression). I recently decided to install Windows 11 and then Fedora 43 KDE from scratch, and it seemed to go well throughout the whole process. I shrunk the original partition with all my data and files and moved it to the right of the drive, leaving about 140 GB of free space at the beginning, which I used to install both of the new operating systems.\n\nI kept repeatedly checking the original partition to see that my files were still there, but at some point after the installation, every disk management utility I had started showing that the partition was completely empty. I mounted the partition and saw that it really was completely empty for some reason. I then spent hours with ChatGPT and old Stack Exchange threads to try to figure out how to recover everything, but nothing seems to be working (stuff involving btrfs rescue, check, recover, find-root). The closest I've gotten was using DMDE, with pretty much the entire filesystem hierarchy shown, but actually recovering the contents of the files often leads to random bytes instead.\n\nI realize it's kind of on me for not making backups more frequently, but I've lots of files that mean a lot to me, so I'd really really appreciate any help at all with recovering the file system. Specifically which methods should I try, and which commands should I run? Thank you",

    "title": "My PC is crashing 5 minutes into playing a specific game but I don't think it's the game's fault.",
    "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying that I'm by no means an expert in the field of PCs so excuse me if some of the wording I use is incorrect.\n\nI've had my PC for about 4 years and have gone through several issues but the one I'm facing now is making me want to give up. The PC wasn't new when I got it but it was a trusted friend of mine's old gaming PC, which he had fully rebuilt before giving it to me. \n\nThe first time facing any type of issue was when I started playing Borderlands 3 about 2 years ago. The game starting up would crash the PC (straight to blue screen). At first it would be occasional (1 in 4 launches) but it progressively got more and more frequent (9 in 10 launches). I know the game's optimization was crap so I chalked it up to being a mix between that and the fact that my PC was a pretty low performance build. What ended up fixing the issue was removing one of the two 16gb DDR4 ram sticks. So my next guess was that one of the sticks was faulty and since all my games were running fine with just one 16gb stick I didn't bother to look into it any further. \n\nMy build at the time was the following: \n\nWindows 11 \n\nAorus B550 Pro mobo \n\nAMD 5 Ryzen 2600 CPU \n\nPNY Gtx 1060 6gb GPU\n\nCorsair tx 750 80+ Gold PSU \n\nDidn't have any real issues after that, until about 3 weeks ago, when I started playing BF6. I knew my PC was severely underspecced for the game so I was ready to upgrade if need be. The game was running ok on my old build when setting everything to low and capping fps to 40, as long as I wasn't playing any large scale game modes (breakthrough and conquest provoked severe stuttering but rush and tdm were fine). Although performance was crap, the game was stable, no crashes of any sort. \n\nI ended up upgrading my CPU and GPU in order to fully enjoy the game and the idea was to get a future proof GPU and get a mid range CPU as my mobo is quite old and didn't want to invest too much in a part that might be upgraded again in the near future, if I changed mobo. So I went with a Gigabyte 5060Ti 16gb GPU and an AMD Ryzen 7 5700G CPU. I tried reinserting both 16gb ram sticks after the upgrade, which seemed to work okay. Bf6 was still stuttering in large scale game modes, but much less than before. I tried a friend's single 32gb stick and that seemed to work. My birthday was coming up so my friend bought me two new 16gb (faster) ram sticks and everything was looking good. \n\nPerformance was great but started getting occasional crashes every 2-3 hours of gameplay or so. Again, full PC crash, sometimes straight to blue screen, sometimes infinite reboot and always accompanied by an audio glitch (kind of like the sound of an air compressor filling it's reservoir) and only playing BF6 (other games I play include rdr2, chivalry 2, Elfen Ring, which have never caused issues). Manual force restart usually worked and I could play again for a few hours. \n\nI was running the game way under what my system is supposedly capable of but the crashes started getting more and more frequent. Checked CPU temp, averaged about 45‚Å∞ so that couldn't be it. I had updated my bios to F18i before upgrading GPU and CPU, drivers were up to date, windows up to date. Basically checked all of the usual suspects (that I know of). Did a bunch of troubleshooting looking into specific BF6 crash fixes and still haven't been successful. \n\nIt actually got to the point where my PC was starting to crash before I even opened steam. At first, the PC would fully crash on first startup after loging into window and arriving in desktop. 2nd start would work and I'd usually be able to play a couple of hours without any issues. Then it got worse, to the point where my PC would crash everytime I'd log into window. 30sec into opening desktop it would crash, often to a dark grey screen, sometimes even the manual power button wouldn't work. \n\nI ended up doing a clean install of windows 11 and at least my OS now seems to be stable. But the crashes on BF6 have actually gotten worse, PC crashes about 10-15 minutes into gameplay. Same crash as usual, full PC crash, although the crash isn't as abrupt as before. I'm usually able to speak with my friends on discord after the game crashes for about 1-2 minutes while the PC itself starts crashing, whereas before it used to just instantly crash everything. \n\nI tried disabling a few things in bios such as XMP, CPU performance Boost and a few other things. Upped the ram voltage to 1.35 as it was set to 1.25 (sticks are 1.35), lowered CPU clocking ratio from 38 to 35. Disabled steam overlay. Tried a bunch of other weird BF6 specific solutions without any success. \n\nLast thing I changed was setting the game's exe files to be compatible with an older version of windows and running them as admin, as that has somehow helped a few people. Also set the game to launch with dx11. Haven't had time to try it out since then so hopefully it fixes it but I somehow doubt that. I still need to try and launch the game as a window rather than borderless and I saw something about setting \"Enableglint\" to 0 in steam. The last thing I might try is reverting my bios to an older version.  \n\nI'm honestly quite close to getting a new motherboard and PSU, as they're the only two parts that haven't been swapped recently. \n\nSorry about the length of this post but I felt that the more context is given, the easier it is to diagnose. Thanks in advance for any suggestions. \n\nTLDR: BF6 is crashing my PC and I'm starting to lose my mind ",

    "selftext": "A couple days ago I bought a samsung flip 7. It‚Äôs a nice phone but something is really bugging me. \nAt some moment it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòreact‚Äô to touchscreen. In other apps/moments, the touchscreen is completely fine. \nMost of the time it doesn‚Äôt work when it needs to pop up a log in for example. It‚Äôs really annoying and makes me not want to use the phone. I can‚Äôt find anything online, since the touchscreen is technically not broken. I already did a factory reset and that fixed it for a day. \nFor example when I press on login to samsung in settings, I see that the ‚Äòlog in‚Äô button is being pressed but the pop up to login doesn‚Äôt show up. And moments before it dis show up but I couldn‚Äôt log in through google because that then wouldn‚Äôt show up. ",

I don't know if it's coil whine or an obstruction in the fan, the sound is mostly towards the left centre, while the fan is further right. Could it be a loose wire or something failing in the hardware? I want to bring it away to get it checked but I don't wanna waste my money if it's nothing serious.\n\nI need to add that the noise sometimes gets a bit more pitched and that I did see a bit of hard plastic come out.",

    "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve run into a pretty strange situation with my Lenovo Legion 5 Pro, and I‚Äôd appreciate any insights from the community.\n\nLast year, my laptop‚Äôs display suddenly went blank while I was using it ‚Äî the screen turned off, and the laptop would also power off by itself. I took it to a technician, and I was told that my GPU is gone so my laptop is dead now. Then i went to another renowned technician in my couuntry as there are no lenovo service centers over here thus i had to find the best technician possible and he said there was a fault with the RAM chip, which he repaired. He also mentioned that there might be a display-related issue on the motherboard and I have to change the LCD panel. But i didnt opt for it. \n\nAfter that, I started using a second monitor (external display) for months. Since my GPU wasn‚Äôt working, I uninstalled the GPU driver from Device Manager and used the laptop through CPU graphics only. It worked fine that way for quite a while.\n\nThen, a few days ago, something unbelievable happened ‚Äî my laptop‚Äôs built-in display suddenly came back to life, and the GPU started working again too. Even the fans kicked in properly, and everything seems normal now. It‚Äôs been three to four days, and it‚Äôs still running perfectly fine on the internal screen.\n\nThe only issues I‚Äôm facing now are:\n\nNo internal sound output\n\nOne key on the keyboard isn‚Äôt working\n\n\nOtherwise, everything‚Äôs smooth. Interestingly, the same thing happened about a month ago, but that time the display turned off again the very same day. This time, it‚Äôs stable for days.\n\nI‚Äôm just curious ‚Äî what could have caused this sudden recovery?\nCould it have been:\n\nA loose or corroded display cable (eDP) that somehow reconnected?\n\nA GPU solder joint temporarily reconnecting?\n\nOr some kind of BIOS/firmware self-repair or driver auto-reinitialization by Windows or Lenovo Vantage?\n\n\nAny technical insight or similar experiences would be great to hear.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Existing IPS router is corner of house with no way to run a cable to any edge of the house. \nMy idea was to use a secondary router placed near an external wall bridged to IPS router, then run cat5/6 to external building with AP or another router in there. Does anyone know if this works or is lilly to be feasible? \nAlso would a mesh set up inside the main building allow me to run cat5 from a mesh point to the external building. Can't find any information if these mesh kits can then support a physical cable to AP!\n\nFyi, EoP is not an option and WiFi boosters won't work inside the external building due to high level of insulation with foil!\n\nThanks.

I don't think that both my cpu and ram decided to fail at the same time, also there wasn't any short when I fumbled with the pins 2months ago, I managed to start the pc this Sunday don't ask me how I forgot, kept it idling for 10m no freeze or anything but after I turned it off, no longer started, I am in a cold room btw, there isn't any condensation on the board and if there is, that's why I'm heating up the board with a hair drier so it evaporates\n\nPlease help! Also I can't buy a new motherboard and CPU because I completed the pc at the start of summer and barely used it 1month everyday and worked absolutely fine, no warranty\n\nAlso tried 2 psus\n\nPhoto of socket: https://ibb.co/3yvRcmqN\n2Broken pins, DDI3(not causing issues unless u use igpu), Ground, the 2VCC pins were like that the whole time, worked fine for 2months",

    "title": "My PC is crashing 5 minutes into playing a specific game but I don't think it's the game's fault.",
    "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying that I'm by no means an expert in the field of PCs so excuse me if some of the wording I use is incorrect.\n\nI've had my PC for about 4 years and have gone through several issues but the one I'm facing now is making me want to give up. The PC wasn't new when I got it but it was a trusted friend of mine's old gaming PC, which he had fully rebuilt before giving it to me. \n\nThe first time facing any type of issue was when I started playing Borderlands 3 about 2 years ago. The game starting up would crash the PC (straight to blue screen). At first it would be occasional (1 in 4 launches) but it progressively got more and more frequent (9 in 10 launches). I know the game's optimization was crap so I chalked it up to being a mix between that and the fact that my PC was a pretty low performance build. What ended up fixing the issue was removing one of the two 16gb DDR4 ram sticks. So my next guess was that one of the sticks was faulty and since all my games were running fine with just one 16gb stick I didn't bother to look into it any further. \n\nMy build at the time was the following: \n\nWindows 11 \n\nAorus B550 Pro mobo \n\nAMD 5 Ryzen 2600 CPU \n\nPNY Gtx 1060 6gb GPU\n\nCorsair tx 750 80+ Gold PSU \n\nDidn't have any real issues after that, until about 3 weeks ago, when I started playing BF6. I knew my PC was severely underspecced for the game so I was ready to upgrade if need be. The game was running ok on my old build when setting everything to low and capping fps to 40, as long as I wasn't playing any large scale game modes (breakthrough and conquest provoked severe stuttering but rush and tdm were fine). Although performance was crap, the game was stable, no crashes of any sort. \n\nI ended up upgrading my CPU and GPU in order to fully enjoy the game and the idea was to get a future proof GPU and get a mid range CPU as my mobo is quite old and didn't want to invest too much in a part that might be upgraded again in the near future, if I changed mobo. So I went with a Gigabyte 5060Ti 16gb GPU and an AMD Ryzen 7 5700G CPU. I tried reinserting both 16gb ram sticks after the upgrade, which seemed to work okay. Bf6 was still stuttering in large scale game modes, but much less than before. I tried a friend's single 32gb stick and that seemed to work. My birthday was coming up so my friend bought me two new 16gb (faster) ram sticks and everything was looking good. \n\nPerformance was great but started getting occasional crashes every 2-3 hours of gameplay or so. Again, full PC crash, sometimes straight to blue screen, sometimes infinite reboot and always accompanied by an audio glitch (kind of like the sound of an air compressor filling it's reservoir) and only playing BF6 (other games I play include rdr2, chivalry 2, Elfen Ring, which have never caused issues). Manual force restart usually worked and I could play again for a few hours. \n\nI was running the game way under what my system is supposedly capable of but the crashes started getting more and more frequent. Checked CPU temp, averaged about 45‚Å∞ so that couldn't be it. I had updated my bios to F18i before upgrading GPU and CPU, drivers were up to date, windows up to date. Basically checked all of the usual suspects (that I know of). Did a bunch of troubleshooting looking into specific BF6 crash fixes and still haven't been successful. \n\nIt actually got to the point where my PC was starting to crash before I even opened steam. At first, the PC would fully crash on first startup after loging into window and arriving in desktop. 2nd start would work and I'd usually be able to play a couple of hours without any issues. Then it got worse, to the point where my PC would crash everytime I'd log into window. 30sec into opening desktop it would crash, often to a dark grey screen, sometimes even the manual power button wouldn't work. \n\nI ended up doing a clean install of windows 11 and at least my OS now seems to be stable. But the crashes on BF6 have actually gotten worse, PC crashes about 10-15 minutes into gameplay. Same crash as usual, full PC crash, although the crash isn't as abrupt as before. I'm usually able to speak with my friends on discord after the game crashes for about 1-2 minutes while the PC itself starts crashing, whereas before it used to just instantly crash everything. \n\nI tried disabling a few things in bios such as XMP, CPU performance Boost and a few other things. Upped the ram voltage to 1.35 as it was set to 1.25 (sticks are 1.35), lowered CPU clocking ratio from 38 to 35. Disabled steam overlay. Tried a bunch of other weird BF6 specific solutions without any success. \n\nLast thing I changed was setting the game's exe files to be compatible with an older version of windows and running them as admin, as that has somehow helped a few people. Also set the game to launch with dx11. Haven't had time to try it out since then so hopefully it fixes it but I somehow doubt that. I still need to try and launch the game as a window rather than borderless and I saw something about setting \"Enableglint\" to 0 in steam. The last thing I might try is reverting my bios to an older version.  \n\nI'm honestly quite close to getting a new motherboard and PSU, as they're the only two parts that haven't been swapped recently. \n\nSorry about the length of this post but I felt that the more context is given, the easier it is to diagnose. Thanks in advance for any suggestions. \n\nTLDR: BF6 is crashing my PC and I'm starting to lose my mind ",

    "selftext": "BLUF:  Need advice on how to sync specific calendar (individual ones) appointments between my personal & work email accounts.  The way I used to do it randomly stopped working in recent months.  I'm not sure if a setting on my iPhone got boogered up or something on my corporate Outlook changed but when I send appointments to myself it won't show up on my work email. I also tested sending one from my work to personal email and that works fine... \n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating how I used to do this, but I noticed recently that when I share calendar appointments with my work email (Office 365 account) from my personal iCloud/iPhone, they aren't forwarded to my company Outlook account.  I add my work email address as an invitee, but it never receives/displays the appointment.   Historically I used to do this a while back so not sure why it's not working.\n\nStrangely, if I invite a personal outlook account (like my wife's Hotmail), this works fine and she gets the invite.  I'm sure there are differences in the backend between a corporate office 365 account and personal outlook, but I find it strange it's not even displaying the invite.  \n\nI receive plenty of images, emails, etc from my personal accounts all the time so I know it's not a matter of it being blocked. \n\nNote:  I don't put personal details, medical information, etc in the calendar items.  For example, if it's a doctor's appt, it will say \"Med Appt\" and I generally will put the address.  If I ever developed a specialty thing where the address might over-share something I wouldn't put that in there but overall, this works for things I need to block out on my calendar, which can get complicated some weeks.",

    "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve run into a pretty strange situation with my Lenovo Legion 5 Pro, and I‚Äôd appreciate any insights from the community.\n\nLast year, my laptop‚Äôs display suddenly went blank while I was using it ‚Äî the screen turned off, and the laptop would also power off by itself. I took it to a technician, and I was told that my GPU is gone so my laptop is dead now. Then i went to another renowned technician in my couuntry as there are no lenovo service centers over here thus i had to find the best technician possible and he said there was a fault with the RAM chip, which he repaired. He also mentioned that there might be a display-related issue on the motherboard and I have to change the LCD panel. But i didnt opt for it. \n\nAfter that, I started using a second monitor (external display) for months. Since my GPU wasn‚Äôt working, I uninstalled the GPU driver from Device Manager and used the laptop through CPU graphics only. It worked fine that way for quite a while.\n\nThen, a few days ago, something unbelievable happened ‚Äî my laptop‚Äôs built-in display suddenly came back to life, and the GPU started working again too. Even the fans kicked in properly, and everything seems normal now. It‚Äôs been three to four days, and it‚Äôs still running perfectly fine on the internal screen.\n\nThe only issues I‚Äôm facing now are:\n\nNo internal sound output\n\nOne key on the keyboard isn‚Äôt working\n\n\nOtherwise, everything‚Äôs smooth. Interestingly, the same thing happened about a month ago, but that time the display turned off again the very same day. This time, it‚Äôs stable for days.\n\nI‚Äôm just curious ‚Äî what could have caused this sudden recovery?\nCould it have been:\n\nA loose or corroded display cable (eDP) that somehow reconnected?\n\nA GPU solder joint temporarily reconnecting?\n\nOr some kind of BIOS/firmware self-repair or driver auto-reinitialization by Windows or Lenovo Vantage?\n\n\nAny technical insight or similar experiences would be great to hear.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "I bought a Logitech C920 webcam and want to use it's mic for video calls, however I am experiencing a low pitch static noise with it. I had a webcam before, which didn't have this issue with it's mic.\n\nI have a headset microphone that works perfectly as well.\n\nI tried:\n\n\\- Reinstalling audio driver\n\n\\- Plugging into different USB ports, on the back of PC and on Monitor HUB as well\n\n\\- Tried the webcam on other PC, no static noise.\n\n\\- If I move my hand closer to the camera, the noise intensifies.\n\n\\- Restarting PC, plugging PC into different outlet.\n\n  \nI have made a recording: [https://vocaroo.com/1aSHer708Hgb](https://vocaroo.com/1aSHer708Hgb)\n\n  \nCould be a grounding issue that I didn't indentify for years? How do I find it?",

    "selftext": "Keep getting a message saying internet access is blocked, firewall or antivirus software may have blocked connection. Two things happened recently.  I installed AVG Antivirus. I believe that this was the mistake that fucked me but I could be wrong and i cant seem to get rid of the fucker. And a storm happened that knocked out my power. My internet is working fine on everything else. Just downloaded Black ops 6 on my ps5. But I cannot do anything on my pc. I've runs diagnostics everywhere I can. Reset my network, router, and pc multiple times. Turned off literally all of my firewall and antivirus stuff, but still cant connect. Please somebody help me.",
