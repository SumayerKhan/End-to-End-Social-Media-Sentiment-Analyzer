    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "iPhone & Wi-Fi 7",
    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7’s most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> • **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> • **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> • **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> • **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3–4× higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time — yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple’s iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism — effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it’s a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn’t support 240 MHz channels — but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple’s iPhones simply don’t take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple’s documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> • [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> • [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> • [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> • [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> • [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> • [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> • [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> • [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> • [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> • [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> • [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard. Apple’s current implementation delivers **minimal improvement over Wi-Fi 6/6E**.  \n>  \n> **If you’d like to see full Wi-Fi 7 features enabled on Apple devices, submit feedback via Safari:**  \n\n1. Type *AppleFeedback://* in the address bar and press Enter  \n2. Press **New Feedback**  \n3. Tap **iOS & iPadOS**  \n4. Enter *iPhone Wi-Fi 7 features* as the title  \n5. Select **Wi-Fi** under *“What area are you seeing this issue?”*  \n6. Choose **Suggestion** under *“What type of feedback are you reporting?”*  \n7. In *Details*, write: *Please enable MLMR MLO, 4096-QAM, and 320 MHz channel width support.*  \n\n> For the remaining fields, fill them out as you prefer and submit the feedback request.  \n>  \n> **Thank you!**",

Apple claims that the DMA’s interoperability requirements, its classification of the App Store under the law, and the investigation into iMessage all violate its rights and could compromise user privacy and security. The DMA, enacted in 2023, aims to regulate the power of large tech companies and has also faced criticism from the US.",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

On one hand, it looks sleek and makes checking time or notifications effortless. But on the other, I feel like it’s quietly nibbling away at my battery life for no real reason — especially since I still end up tapping the screen half the time out of habit anyway 😅.\n\nEspecially on the latest iPhones running iOS 26, I’m noticing mixed opinions — some say Apple’s optimized it really well, others say battery drain is still noticeable.\n\nSo I’m wondering — do most of you just leave it on all the time, or do you prefer keeping it off to save battery? And if you do keep it on, does it actually make your day-to-day use better, or is it more of a “looks cool but meh” feature?\n\nLet’s settle this once and for all — AOD gang vs. battery conservation squad\n(and please, I know there’s a battery megathread already — this one’s just about usage and preference",

I had traded my 15 and $400 cash for his 16 Pro Max with 26 cycles. I came across a Reddit post explaining the significance of the first letter in the model number. Curious, I checked mine, and it turned out that “M” stands for a new retail device, “F” for a refurbished device, “N” for a replacement device, and “P” for a personalized device with an engraving. I’m wondering if this information is accurate. Additionally, I’m interested in knowing what other people have and if there are any differences between the retail-sold and replacement models. ",

With the newer models out, is the 15 Plus considered outdated at this point, or is it still a solid phone to stick with?\n\nFrom my experience, it’s been really reliable so far — but I’ve also heard that the 15 Plus still has one of the longest battery lives among current iPhones (and even compared to some Androids).\n\nFor those who’ve used or recently switched from the 15 Plus, what do you think are its main benefits or drawbacks in 2025? Is it still a good daily driver, or worth upgrading soon?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",

I wasn’t able to access that Apple ID because I forgot the password and the only I could reset it was if I could enter the passcode I used on that iPhone 6. Nothing worked. Went through account recovery, which I had to wait a week for to reset the password, and now can log in to my old Apple ID.\n\nThe new issue I’m having is that it wants to sync my data from devices connected to that ID, which had included that iPhone 6 and an old laptop that’s been trashed. So it keep telling me to resume the data sync and the only way to do so is by entering the old passcode for that iPhone 6, even after I had removed that, and the trashed laptop, from the Apple ID. \n\nAs of right now, my settings icon has a permanent badge and option to continue syncing data from a phone I don’t have with a pass code that I don’t remember. \n\nAny insight would be welcome!",

I am hoping it should be fine, I am too scared to use the phone now, I switched it off and left it on my desk. Should I be concerned?

    "title": "Design theory - blur the edges",
    "selftext": "I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 to an Air and I was nervous that the formula for the Air (small battery, less camera, etc.) was going to create product that simply wouldn’t be commercial. With all the press around the launch  I was almost scared off from buying the Air since it was dismissed as a big mis-step for Apple in the vein of Apple Intelligence. Being an Apple fan boy since my first iPod, I’ve always considered that any product I buy from Apple is going to be one of the best products I’ve ever purchased. I was concerned that the Air simply couldn’t live up to this expectation especially for the price. But how wrong I was! A month into using my new phone, it’s quite simply the best piece of hardware I’ve owned, and here’s why:\n\nThe highlights of the experience are mainly in the fluidity of IOS26 paired with the promotion display, the phone flies compared to my 12. My interactions with the phone are way more engaging and natural, stack on Dynamic Island and all of the intrigue from the transparency effects in this OS - i basically just want to stare at it even if i have nothing to really do on it. \n\nWhich brings me to my main point which is: Apple is still at the forefront of hardware and software integration. Despite all the hot air around AI and how abysmal Siri really is, Apple has really doubled down on unifying the software and hardware to the point that using a button feels like touching the software, touching the hardware feels like touching the OS directly. As a consumer I find that very compelling. If a product is so well considered that the form of the hardware is indistinguishable from the software it really opens up a new tech experience which I think is worth more than AI functionality. \n\nI notice the considerations for the hardware on the Air, thinness being the biggest, and I greatly enjoy the design direction it conveys: make the tech invisible so that the experience feels like magic. I think that’s always been a focal point for apple’s brand and why the Air feels like the first return to the Jobs era of product design for the iPhone lineup in a long time. A product that blurs the edges between digital space and the physical world (without a headset) will get my money every time. ",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

Now this new phone is having this issue with this one number.\n\nThis issue is even more important because whenever I call them back, I get a receptionist that, of course, wants to take down my number, and have the doctor or nurse call me back, AGAIN.  But they can't ever get through.\n\nI have searched here and elsewhere and have not found any definitive answers yet.",

I ran Apple Diagnostics and it clearly said hardware issue. Even the authorized Apple Service Center in my city (India) confirmed something was wrong, so they sent my phone to Apple under warranty.\n\nBut now Apple has sent my phone back saying “No Trouble Found.” The weird part? My warranty was valid till October 5, but they dispatched my phone back on October 1 and now that I’ve received it, the warranty has expired. The phone started working fine but again since yesterday the same issue.\n\nI updated to iOS 26.0.1, which Apple themselves say fixes “some users may be unable to connect to a cellular network after updating to iOS 26”  but my issue still persists.\n\nSo… what do I even do now? \nDo I have any chance of Apple fixing this under warranty since I reported and sent it before expiry? Has anyone else faced this cellular issue after iOS 26 / 26.0.1?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would really help.🙏",

Sure, if they stole 10, they would get 1000 ig, but I am also just a tad bit hopeful that they might try to it sell it from a second hand website or so, so very slight chance but, maybe the naive buyer would be able contact me.\n\nCould anyone, who has/ had this experience enlighten me a bit, especially about my chances of getting it back?\n\nThanks so much already!",

    "selftext": "Just finished using my last one for a couple of days with iPhone 16 pro max (Hohem isteady v3 ultra) and I figured it’s time to post my quick rundown of the best gimbals to consider in 2025. Been testing these over the last few months so here’s a quick take on what each one’s good at, who it’s for and how they compare in price/performance.  \n  \n1. Hohem isteady v3 ultra is priced around $170 and feels like Hohem really leaned into the AI and remote-control side of things. The standout feature is the detachable AI tracker with its own little camera and fill light plus a remote touchscreen that gives you a live feed. You can literally control the gimbal remotely, watching yourself from a distance while recording (perfect if you film alone). It can also add the sub-screen remote control feature. Not only can you view your composition through the exclusive touch remote but you can also scan the QR code with another device in the hohem joy app’s camera to start remote access, making filming effortless, without the need to purchase an Apple watch. It’s light to carry around and even includes an extension rod and tripod legs built in for creative low or high angle shots. If you’re a solo creator or vlogger who needs something compact with reliable subject tracking and within reasonable price, this one might be exactly what you need.  \n  \n2. DJI osmo mobile 7P uses their new Activetrack 7.0 which is noticeably smoother than last year’s version. The 7P model includes a modular attachment that combines a fill light and microphone input which is great if you’re trying to streamline your mobile filming setup. Build quality feels premium and the app integration is also great. It’s an easy recommendation for anyone who values reliable tracking and straightforward functionality over experimental add-ons. Price wise the 7P sits around $125 - $150 on different sites.  \n  \n3. Insta360 flow 2 Pro is a clever update to last year’s flow line. It's more compact, folds neatly and introduces deep track 4.0 which offers improved multi-person tracking and intelligent subject switching. You can also control it remotely using an Apple watch or a second phone but the smartphone functionality may require additional setup. It’s great for travel vloggers, casual creators or anyone who wants solid stabilization without lugging around something bulky. It is priced around $160.  \n  \n4. GoPro fluid pro AI gimbal is designed to handle not just smartphones but also GoPros. It has impressive AI-driven tracking, a built-in fill light and can run up to 18 hours. It doubles as a power bank which makes it really appealing. It’s priced around $230, making it the priciest on this list but you’re paying for flexibility and endurance. It’s not something I’d recommend for casual users or daily vlogging though looking for cost effective gear.  \n  \nAll of these were released in 2025 and it has been a surprisingly strong year for gimbals especially considering how well they go with iPhones. No bad picks this time, just choose based on your style and how much gear you’re willing to carry.",

The PITAKA one looks perfect but I can’t find it anywhere in the EU, and the Alogic Matrix+ is way out of my budget.\n\nThe Mous one looks high-quality and safe, but I’m not sure because im not sure if its weight to much or can fit in his pocket, and he is not going to use the 3 daily. The SwanScout one looks good on paper but I’m not sure if it’s reliable or just another rebranded product.\n\nDoes anyone know any verified, good-quality brand (Anker level or similar) that makes something detachable like PITAKA — or has personally tested one that doesn’t overheat or damage the battery? Because battery health and good quality things are important for him\n\nI’m in France, so I’d prefer something that ships to the EU\n\nThanks in advance! 💗",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

I’ve been an iPhone user since the original was released in 2007, typically upgrading every 1-2 years, and I’ve never had second thoughts about a purchase. However, the battery life on the air is just not enough for me. \n\nI’m typically taking the phone off charger around 6am, and while sometimes I have some juice left when I go to bed around 11pm or so, many times it’s on low battery mode, or I have to top it off. I wouldn’t consider myself a power user, but I use my phone consistently throughout the day. The battery is at 100% capacity, and it’s struggling to keep up with my needs. It’s hard to imagine what it would be like at 90% capacity. \n\nWhen I couple the battery issues with the camera deficiencies and the single speaker, I’m left regretting my purchase. I do make calls on speaker sometimes, and the single speaker can make it hard to hear the person on the other end. I do like the form factor, and that is why I gave it a shot, but to have dramatically better battery/camera/speaker for only $100 more with the pro, I will be returning my air and purchasing the pro. I will miss having a lighter phone, but the tradeoffs on performance are simply not worth it. ",

My interactions with the phone are way more engaging and natural, stack on Dynamic Island and all of the intrigue from the transparency effects in this OS - i basically just want to stare at it even if i have nothing to really do on it. \n\nWhich brings me to my main point which is: Apple is still at the forefront of hardware and software integration. Despite all the hot air around AI and how abysmal Siri really is, Apple has really doubled down on unifying the software and hardware to the point that using a button feels like touching the software, touching the hardware feels like touching the OS directly. As a consumer I find that very compelling. If a product is so well considered that the form of the hardware is indistinguishable from the software it really opens up a new tech experience which I think is worth more than AI functionality. \n\nI notice the considerations for the hardware on the Air, thinness being the biggest, and I greatly enjoy the design direction it conveys: make the tech invisible so that the experience feels like magic. I think that’s always been a focal point for apple’s brand and why the Air feels like the first return to the Jobs era of product design for the iPhone lineup in a long time. A product that blurs the edges between digital space and the physical world (without a headset) will get my money every time. ",

On one hand, it looks sleek and makes checking time or notifications effortless. But on the other, I feel like it’s quietly nibbling away at my battery life for no real reason — especially since I still end up tapping the screen half the time out of habit anyway 😅.\n\nEspecially on the latest iPhones running iOS 26, I’m noticing mixed opinions — some say Apple’s optimized it really well, others say battery drain is still noticeable.\n\nSo I’m wondering — do most of you just leave it on all the time, or do you prefer keeping it off to save battery? And if you do keep it on, does it actually make your day-to-day use better, or is it more of a “looks cool but meh” feature?\n\nLet’s settle this once and for all — AOD gang vs. battery conservation squad\n(and please, I know there’s a battery megathread already — this one’s just about usage and preference",

Went through account recovery, which I had to wait a week for to reset the password, and now can log in to my old Apple ID.\n\nThe new issue I’m having is that it wants to sync my data from devices connected to that ID, which had included that iPhone 6 and an old laptop that’s been trashed. So it keep telling me to resume the data sync and the only way to do so is by entering the old passcode for that iPhone 6, even after I had removed that, and the trashed laptop, from the Apple ID. \n\nAs of right now, my settings icon has a permanent badge and option to continue syncing data from a phone I don’t have with a pass code that I don’t remember. \n\nAny insight would be welcome!",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

I’ve been an iPhone user since the original was released in 2007, typically upgrading every 1-2 years, and I’ve never had second thoughts about a purchase. However, the battery life on the air is just not enough for me. \n\nI’m typically taking the phone off charger around 6am, and while sometimes I have some juice left when I go to bed around 11pm or so, many times it’s on low battery mode, or I have to top it off. I wouldn’t consider myself a power user, but I use my phone consistently throughout the day. The battery is at 100% capacity, and it’s struggling to keep up with my needs. It’s hard to imagine what it would be like at 90% capacity. \n\nWhen I couple the battery issues with the camera deficiencies and the single speaker, I’m left regretting my purchase. I do make calls on speaker sometimes, and the single speaker can make it hard to hear the person on the other end. I do like the form factor, and that is why I gave it a shot, but to have dramatically better battery/camera/speaker for only $100 more with the pro, I will be returning my air and purchasing the pro. I will miss having a lighter phone, but the tradeoffs on performance are simply not worth it. ",

    "selftext": "I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 to an Air and I was nervous that the formula for the Air (small battery, less camera, etc.) was going to create product that simply wouldn’t be commercial. With all the press around the launch  I was almost scared off from buying the Air since it was dismissed as a big mis-step for Apple in the vein of Apple Intelligence. Being an Apple fan boy since my first iPod, I’ve always considered that any product I buy from Apple is going to be one of the best products I’ve ever purchased. I was concerned that the Air simply couldn’t live up to this expectation especially for the price. But how wrong I was! A month into using my new phone, it’s quite simply the best piece of hardware I’ve owned, and here’s why:\n\nThe highlights of the experience are mainly in the fluidity of IOS26 paired with the promotion display, the phone flies compared to my 12. My interactions with the phone are way more engaging and natural, stack on Dynamic Island and all of the intrigue from the transparency effects in this OS - i basically just want to stare at it even if i have nothing to really do on it. \n\nWhich brings me to my main point which is: Apple is still at the forefront of hardware and software integration. Despite all the hot air around AI and how abysmal Siri really is, Apple has really doubled down on unifying the software and hardware to the point that using a button feels like touching the software, touching the hardware feels like touching the OS directly. As a consumer I find that very compelling. If a product is so well considered that the form of the hardware is indistinguishable from the software it really opens up a new tech experience which I think is worth more than AI functionality. \n\nI notice the considerations for the hardware on the Air, thinness being the biggest, and I greatly enjoy the design direction it conveys: make the tech invisible so that the experience feels like magic. I think that’s always been a focal point for apple’s brand and why the Air feels like the first return to the Jobs era of product design for the iPhone lineup in a long time. A product that blurs the edges between digital space and the physical world (without a headset) will get my money every time. ",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI missed the Titan 2 Kickstarter by just two days 😓 and have been trying to buy one since October — but so far, no luck placing a regular order.\n\nI’ve seen a few media and YouTube reviews, but I’m specifically looking for feedback from **actual users who backed it or got it after launch**, not influencer or press units.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Samsung is canceling the upcoming s26 edge completly. but should it?\n\nCurrent reports say its because of poor sales of the 25 edge (only 178k in the first month) vs the other s series (s25 ultra with 1.5m, s25 with more than 1m). \n\nFor my opinion, the poor sales of the s25 edge were caused only because thats a new technology and it was mostly a prototype phone.\nIt had many problems and seemed rushed and unfinished (wasnt that thin, small battery, no telephoto camera). It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

But after opening it up, everything looked totally fine, no physical issues.\n\nSo now I’m stuck. No clue what to do next. For now, I guess I’ll just wait for the next monthly update (the one they usually drop on the first Monday of the month) and hope that somehow fixes it.\n\nReally sucks to have paid this much for a phone and end up dealing with stuff like this. It shouldn't be happening.\n\nAny ideas?",

Adjusting the brightness scale will only change the hue where \"dimmest\" setting is teal and \"brightess\" setting is red and the middle is neutral. u/Raychii took a video of the exact issue. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1k8s7qh/intermittent_screen_discolouration_on_pixel_9_pro/mp8pghn/ When this happens, the always on display will not work either. The full brightness in a dark room burns my eyes when I try to use my phone.\n\nI tolerated it this long because I used to be able to \"force\" the autobrightness to work by adjusting the brightness scale to the middle two times in a row. It would finally adjust the brightness and the always on display would work.\n\nBut that would stop working again when I put my phone in my pocket and walked around. The brightness would be 100% again with the same issues described above.\n\nLately, some new update disabled that workaround. The phone has a mind of its own when I can adjust the brightness. You cannot imagine my frustration of wanting to throw the phone against the wall when it's on 100% brightness all the time. I might end up trading the phone and going back to Samsung if I can't find a fix.",

I'll await responses because I could be wrong.",

    "selftext": "So I'm new here in the forum, honestly I might not even be here to see if anyone replies to this or not, just wanted to tell some people who are struggling with this bug like me what I found out.  \n\n So, since last month my notifications were working just fine on my phone without a  problem, slowly but surely I started noticing my notifications would go from popping up on the pull down bar/lock screen to only popping up when I click on an app.\n\n I tried the DOZE stopper trick, tried to disable all the battery/connection optimisations and even cleared all the storage and cache on every single app.\n\n On the verge of just factory resetting my phone I tried a mix match of settings to try and pinpoint which setting was causing this issue. Come to find out it was none of these (in my case). I finally decided to just disable 5gUW, turned on wifi, turned off doze stopper, and reenabled all the optimisation settings just for the hell of it and wouldn't you know it, I got all my notifications without a hitch. No delay, and every notification told me what exactly it was notifying me of. \n\nWhen I was on IOS I never had this issue, and this is a really big bummer for me cause I switched to pixel because I wanted to try out android since it's been so long and the pixel felt like the most iphone feeling android device so it made switching easier. Sadly tho, I'm more of a first impressions kind of guy so I'm probably going back to IOS after dealing with this headache for almost 2 months. Now I only use 5gUW if I can't get wifi signal anywhere which blows cause now a feature I pay for is severely hindered.",

    "selftext": "Context: I live in Germany and Google support has offered me the option to send me a replacement device for my month old Pixel 9 due to potential OLED image retention/burn-in issues (anyone else with this issue?)\n\nWas wondering if anyone has experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany, because I have a few questions:\n\n1. Do they reject your RMA claims even for the slightest cosmetic damage? (My phone has a single minor hairline scratch on the screen and based on the other stories about RMA in the EU, I'm worried I'm going to have to go without a phone for 2 weeks only for my claim to get rejected and I cannot afford to go without a phone for so long)\n\n\n2. Does it actually take 5-10 business days as Google says, or is it longer? Does the phone get shipped to Poland?\n\n\n3. Do they always only send refurbished replacements or do they send new ones sometimes too? (One support agent told me the device will be brand new, the other one wasn't so clear, but I don't think I can rely on their word because based on other stories in this sub, there seems to be no consistency b/w their support agents and what their actual RMA/repair partner in Europe does, let alone among their own support agents itself)\n\n\nI was also told by Google support that I could get my phone repaired at Comspot (Google's authorized repair partner in Germany). They offer walk-in same-day repairs. My only gripe with this is repairing the phone instead of replacing it may void the water resistance rating, which is a real shame for a phone that's only a month old.\n\n\nWhat do y'all think? Should I risk RMA-ing it, or wait it out, see how the burn-in situation goes and based on that just go to the repair center (Comspot)?",

Around May I started thinking about replacing it for an upcoming holiday.\n\nSeptember arrives and the battery goes from mediocre to lasting 2 hours max.\n\nThankfully due to this sub I found out it's a known problem so got £300 store credit. Birthday thing was coming round so I was looking forward to double discount but alas not. Anyway I get a Pixel 9 for a decent price.\n\nSetup and transfer from the old one suvks. With Apple it takes 30 mins and just works. With Google it installedy apps but that's about it.\n\nAnyway a few weeks later some observations:\n\n1. Battery is v good. A day in Disney and it's still at 50%. You need to use the park app a lot. \n\n2. Biometrics are awesome. Soooo much faster and reliable.\n\n3. Camera is great. I want an easy point and shoot with good quality results. This is it. Portrait mode rocks.\n\nHope that helps someone! Peace.",

Eventually, restarting no longer worked. My phone was approved for RMA but my son got sick - like *sick* sick - around this time and it completely fell off my radar. Obviously, enough time has passed that it's no longer under warranty and that's my fault. \n\nSo now I have a P8P in pristine condition...other than the Wifi and Bluetooth not working. I would really like to try to get it fixed somehow because it's a very expensive paperweight.\n\nAny thoughts? Suggestions? I would appreciate it very much. ",

Generally speaking, I haven't had many issues and when I do a simple restart usually resolves them.\n\nEnter the Pixel 10 and Watch 4...\n\n* Adaptive Brightness on my Pixel 10 stopped working twice now.  **Google AI's solution worked** and required digging into the settings and clearing a specific Cache to \"reset\" it.\n   * Note:  I never do a \"copy\" when setting up a new phone, I re-configure it from scratch and manually install everything over time.  Usually to try and prevent issues like this and keep my new phone \"clean\" where possible\n* Pixel Watch -> Initially, the steps counter was \"real-time\" and would update every 2-5 steps on average.   Lately I can stare at my watch for 15-30 seconds while walking around and not see it update... then all the sudden it'll add a few 100 steps.   \n   * Note, I restarted the watch and it seems to mostly be working now?\n   * I'm not sure what caused this, possibly turning off my phone?  Leaving my watch to function 100% independently and then when my phone was back in proximity it glitched out?\n* I've had frequent issues where attempting to unlock my device, it acts like it's unlocked but won't load any app icons and shows a blank background image.  I press the lock button and try again and it works. \n   * This isn't unique to a Pixel 10 experience, most phones every so often do this but seems far more common on my pixel 10?",

    "title": "A Post About Disappointment – My First Flagship Phone (Pixel 10 Pro)",
    "selftext": "This is not a hate post. It’s something way more sad in my opinion. It’s a **disappointment post**. But let me start from the beginning.\n\nI've never had a **flagship phone**, mostly because they were simply too expensive to afford. But I've always been a phone geek, checking new models, new features, and watching countless reviews and comparisons on YouTube. In my life, I've had many phones from different brands, but as I said, never a flagship. And the phone I always craved the most, the one that always got my attention, was the **Google Pixel**.\n\nThe year 2025 came, and I decided this was the moment. Two months after my 33rd birthday, I bought the **Pixel 10 Pro** on the day it premiered. I can’t describe the emotions and dopamine rush I got in that moment. There, in a few days, I was going to own the newest flagship, the pinnacle of technology. Fast forward one month, and that's why I'm writing this post.\n\nI've used the Pixel for over a month, and on a daily basis, I can’t say anything bad about the phone. It looks fantastic, the build quality feels good, and I like the camera and overall performance in daily usage (I'm not a benchmark guy, nor do I do a lot of mobile gaming). However, there are some things that truly made me disappointed after so many years of craving a Google flagship phone.\n\nTo not make this already long post any longer, I’m going to list the things that, in my opinion, are **unacceptable**:\n\n**1.** I know this is a new standard, but I don’t like it, and I’m going to say it loud. Buying a phone for 1370 EUR / $1590 (the 512GB version, price from my country) where you don’t even get a **charger** really feels like a rip-off (i know all brands does it).\n\n**2.** After a month of using it, I discovered there are some **noises coming from the Pixel**. My first thought: \"Oh my god, it's broken.\" I was devastated. You should have seen my face when I discovered the whole **\"rattle gate\"** issue. I mean, your phone sounding like something is broken inside whenever you move it faster gives a terrible experience. Even though it doesn't affect performance, this is not what I was expecting from a flagship for that much money. Big disappointment. Guess you can get used to it though.\n\n**3.** In my one+ month of using the Pixel 10 Pro, I had about **3 separate occasions in which I was unable to make a call**. Just like that. I don't have 2G connection blocked or anything like that. I wanted to call someone, but it never actually started dialing. The problem disappeared only after a **phone reset**.\n\nIn my two-year experience with a $200 Redmi, I never once had such a case. Do I need to tell you how disappointing this is? It's actually a big problem. What if the call I'll be making is very important, or time is crucial? \"Oh sorry, this time you can't call, reset your phone.\" This actually gives me anxiety each time I'm calling now because i don't know if i'll be able to. After investigating a bit, I encountered a lot of posts and articles about problems with the modem/GSM module (sorry if thats not it, not really a technical guy) in Pixel phones. So, it's not something new either. Calling is a basic feature of phones, and now the Pixel is failing in this as well?\n\n**4.** Last but not least, I became a Google Pixel fan mostly because of their **\"pure Android experience\"**—the whole \"you can customize what you want,\" etc. But it turns out, you can't even customize the main screen! The Google search bar is **unremovable**, as is the date/calendar add-on. They *have* to be there. Quite a small choice for a \"customize everything phone.\" Same goes for function buttons, you can't swap the order. I mean c'mon google.\n\nWith the date add-on(or widget - not really sure how to call it), I'm also actually getting a **bug** where sometimes it disappears, but when I click the place on the screen where it's supposed to be, the calendar opens. After restarting the phone, I see the widget again. So, that’s another weird thing.\n\nI don't want this to be another hate post. Before buying this phone I was the biggest Pixel fanboy ever. I really do like this phone despite all the issues. This is just the perspective of someone who got his first flagship in 2025, from a company he always thought was the best in the business. And I’m just **disappointed**.",

I'm finally back to Pixel with a 10 Fold. \n\nI'm a traditional keyboard user, ie I type, no gliding. Also, I use gestures for navigation (swipe left instead of the back button).\n\nNow to the problem: in my previous Pixel experience (as well as with One UI), when I have Gboard open and want to close it, I simply swipe from left in any part of the screen. With Android 16, however, the swipe left does not close Gboard if done over Gboard. It doesn't work with the \"one hand\" keyboard view either.\n\nTo close the keyboard I need to swipe left in a place above the keyboard or use the down arrow. This is extremely annoying, since I have to overstretch my thumb to reach above the keyboard what ends up moving the phone and requiring my right hand assistance.\n\nI have triple-checked the settings but could not find out how to solve this one.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

To test if it was the phone or the charger, I tried using the charger from my Moto Edge 60 Pro and surprisingly, it charges fine with that.\n\nSo I ordered a new 45W Ambrane charger along with an Ambrane 60W cable, but the Pixel 8 doesn't charge with that at all. No charging icon, nothing.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue? Is the Pixel 8 picky about chargers or cables? Should I just get another Google charger, or could it be something wrong with my phone's charging port?\n\nAny insights would be appreciated!\n\nEdit - The Moto Edge 60 Pro supports up to 90 W wired charging using its proprietary \"TurboPower\" system.",

Only 90 apps installed. And for some reason everything on Google files app takes forever. Even deleting small PDF files.\nClearing the bin takes minutes every time.\n\nI tried booting to safe mode and it's faster, but not nearly as hers.\n\nI have this with all my pixel phones in the past (1 to 6 and then 9 pro) and I always thought it was a slow efs 2.0 storage. But not on the 9 pro with 256 I know it's 3.1 and should be faster. But had never compared to a direct one from another person before.\nCould it be some glitch because I always come from a the cloud backup when moving to a new phone.\nI don't think it's hardware since I had the same issue with all my other pixel phones, i just thought it was normal.\n\nPs. Everything else on the phone is super smooth. Never had problems with lags or hiccups in any apps. even when freeing up space through Google photos, it's very fast ",

After having the 17 pro since release day, I could no longer put up with the stuttering UI and lesser photography compared to others I have had. Switching to the 10 pro I immediately could tell the software and UI is a lot smoother. Like a finished software compared to Apple ongoing bug fixes. I could also tell the photography is way ahead of Apple in daylight and poor lighting. Of course nothing beats the 17 pros videography. But overall I feel the Pixels are coming up quick on Apple and I feel like my 1,000 dollars is better spent for n the Pixel this year which is surprising due to me being Apple since the X. Also the liquid glass is not my cup of tea personally, it feels like too many people developed it and too many ideas mashed together to make a software fruit salad. ",

I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation. Even standard stabilisation copes perfectly well with normal walking.\n\n  \n2) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 30fps + HDR +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because of the benefits of the Video Optimization mentioned above (clearer image).\n\n3) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 60fps + HDR not available +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because the additional 30 fps do not provide any additional benefit, except that the size of the video becomes larger.\n\n  \n",

I'm now looking more at the 10 Pro or Pro XL but there is some negativity about the Tensor chip and GPU.  \n\nAny 10 Pro / Pro XL / Pro Fold owners want to share their experiences, positive or negative?

The camera is a great improvement too, video are better this time.  I always envied iPhone users when they were taking videos, not anymore now.\n\nThe added pixel snap is great too.  Although it gets a bit hot when using it for charging.  \n\nHaving owned the P2, P4XL, P6 Pro and P8 Pro, it's Google's best phone to date in my opinion.  \n\nI'm tired of always having the faster processor out there, the phone works great and feels snappy.  The P8 pro still feel great too by the way.  I'm really glad google doesn't follow Apple's moto of getting the fastest chip out there, it's just not needed.  The experience on the pixel is great and that's what matters.\n\n  \nThe only negative with google is their naming convention :)\n\nFeel free to ask questions.  \n\n",

Come to find out it was none of these (in my case). I finally decided to just disable 5gUW, turned on wifi, turned off doze stopper, and reenabled all the optimisation settings just for the hell of it and wouldn't you know it, I got all my notifications without a hitch. No delay, and every notification told me what exactly it was notifying me of. \n\nWhen I was on IOS I never had this issue, and this is a really big bummer for me cause I switched to pixel because I wanted to try out android since it's been so long and the pixel felt like the most iphone feeling android device so it made switching easier. Sadly tho, I'm more of a first impressions kind of guy so I'm probably going back to IOS after dealing with this headache for almost 2 months. Now I only use 5gUW if I can't get wifi signal anywhere which blows cause now a feature I pay for is severely hindered.",

Adjusting the brightness scale will only change the hue where \"dimmest\" setting is teal and \"brightess\" setting is red and the middle is neutral. u/Raychii took a video of the exact issue. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1k8s7qh/intermittent_screen_discolouration_on_pixel_9_pro/mp8pghn/ When this happens, the always on display will not work either. The full brightness in a dark room burns my eyes when I try to use my phone.\n\nI tolerated it this long because I used to be able to \"force\" the autobrightness to work by adjusting the brightness scale to the middle two times in a row. It would finally adjust the brightness and the always on display would work.\n\nBut that would stop working again when I put my phone in my pocket and walked around. The brightness would be 100% again with the same issues described above.\n\nLately, some new update disabled that workaround. The phone has a mind of its own when I can adjust the brightness. You cannot imagine my frustration of wanting to throw the phone against the wall when it's on 100% brightness all the time. I might end up trading the phone and going back to Samsung if I can't find a fix.",

    "selftext": "Context: I live in Germany and Google support has offered me the option to send me a replacement device for my month old Pixel 9 due to potential OLED image retention/burn-in issues (anyone else with this issue?)\n\nWas wondering if anyone has experience RMA-ing Pixels in Germany, because I have a few questions:\n\n1. Do they reject your RMA claims even for the slightest cosmetic damage? (My phone has a single minor hairline scratch on the screen and based on the other stories about RMA in the EU, I'm worried I'm going to have to go without a phone for 2 weeks only for my claim to get rejected and I cannot afford to go without a phone for so long)\n\n\n2. Does it actually take 5-10 business days as Google says, or is it longer? Does the phone get shipped to Poland?\n\n\n3. Do they always only send refurbished replacements or do they send new ones sometimes too? (One support agent told me the device will be brand new, the other one wasn't so clear, but I don't think I can rely on their word because based on other stories in this sub, there seems to be no consistency b/w their support agents and what their actual RMA/repair partner in Europe does, let alone among their own support agents itself)\n\n\nI was also told by Google support that I could get my phone repaired at Comspot (Google's authorized repair partner in Germany). They offer walk-in same-day repairs. My only gripe with this is repairing the phone instead of replacing it may void the water resistance rating, which is a real shame for a phone that's only a month old.\n\n\nWhat do y'all think? Should I risk RMA-ing it, or wait it out, see how the burn-in situation goes and based on that just go to the repair center (Comspot)?",

I'm finally back to Pixel with a 10 Fold. \n\nI'm a traditional keyboard user, ie I type, no gliding. Also, I use gestures for navigation (swipe left instead of the back button).\n\nNow to the problem: in my previous Pixel experience (as well as with One UI), when I have Gboard open and want to close it, I simply swipe from left in any part of the screen. With Android 16, however, the swipe left does not close Gboard if done over Gboard. It doesn't work with the \"one hand\" keyboard view either.\n\nTo close the keyboard I need to swipe left in a place above the keyboard or use the down arrow. This is extremely annoying, since I have to overstretch my thumb to reach above the keyboard what ends up moving the phone and requiring my right hand assistance.\n\nI have triple-checked the settings but could not find out how to solve this one.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

The camera is a great improvement too, video are better this time.  I always envied iPhone users when they were taking videos, not anymore now.\n\nThe added pixel snap is great too.  Although it gets a bit hot when using it for charging.  \n\nHaving owned the P2, P4XL, P6 Pro and P8 Pro, it's Google's best phone to date in my opinion.  \n\nI'm tired of always having the faster processor out there, the phone works great and feels snappy.  The P8 pro still feel great too by the way.  I'm really glad google doesn't follow Apple's moto of getting the fastest chip out there, it's just not needed.  The experience on the pixel is great and that's what matters.\n\n  \nThe only negative with google is their naming convention :)\n\nFeel free to ask questions.  \n\n",

Come to find out it was none of these (in my case). I finally decided to just disable 5gUW, turned on wifi, turned off doze stopper, and reenabled all the optimisation settings just for the hell of it and wouldn't you know it, I got all my notifications without a hitch. No delay, and every notification told me what exactly it was notifying me of. \n\nWhen I was on IOS I never had this issue, and this is a really big bummer for me cause I switched to pixel because I wanted to try out android since it's been so long and the pixel felt like the most iphone feeling android device so it made switching easier. Sadly tho, I'm more of a first impressions kind of guy so I'm probably going back to IOS after dealing with this headache for almost 2 months. Now I only use 5gUW if I can't get wifi signal anywhere which blows cause now a feature I pay for is severely hindered.",

Adjusting the brightness scale will only change the hue where \"dimmest\" setting is teal and \"brightess\" setting is red and the middle is neutral. u/Raychii took a video of the exact issue. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1k8s7qh/intermittent_screen_discolouration_on_pixel_9_pro/mp8pghn/ When this happens, the always on display will not work either. The full brightness in a dark room burns my eyes when I try to use my phone.\n\nI tolerated it this long because I used to be able to \"force\" the autobrightness to work by adjusting the brightness scale to the middle two times in a row. It would finally adjust the brightness and the always on display would work.\n\nBut that would stop working again when I put my phone in my pocket and walked around. The brightness would be 100% again with the same issues described above.\n\nLately, some new update disabled that workaround. The phone has a mind of its own when I can adjust the brightness. You cannot imagine my frustration of wanting to throw the phone against the wall when it's on 100% brightness all the time. I might end up trading the phone and going back to Samsung if I can't find a fix.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

(The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra?

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

    "selftext": "I’ve never been a big fan of Samsung electronics. Didn’t have anything against them per se, but I just wasn’t often impressed by them. I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed.

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "Samsung galaxy s25 edge 1 month review - Underrated",
    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been using the **Fold 6** for a while now ! love it overall, though I do have a bit of buyer’s regret here and there. Still, I’m happy I didn’t overspend just to chase the newest trend. 😅\n\nNow I’m looking to pick up a **Galaxy Watch Classic** to go with it. I want something that feels premium, lasts a few years, and doesn’t make me feel like I have to upgrade every time Samsung releases a new one. Basically, something that’s good enough to keep and forget about the hype cycle.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n* **Watch 4 Classic** – budget-friendly, but maybe too dated now?\n* **Watch 6 Classic** – seems like the sweet spot for value and performance.\n* **Watch 8 Classic** – newer, but not sure if the price jump is worth it.\n\nFor anyone rocking a Fold + Watch combo:  \nWhich Classic model do you think hits the best balance between **price, features, and longevity**?  \nI’m aiming for that “buy it once and chill” kind of setup. Appreciate any input 🙏",

If you are having an issue when your Galaxy watch goes into a sleep mode where the always on display and raise to wake are being turned off and not turned back on when you wake up, this is for you. Go into your modes and routines and just toggle those settings off in the sleep mode. I know that this is not ideal if you want it to turn on and off automatically however I don't think that having these things on while sleeping really affects wearing the watch much. ",

Can’t wait to see if it motivates me or just roasts me for my “brisk walking” pace.\n\nBut seriously, can someone explain why some of these new features aren’t available on the other Galaxy Watches?\nSame sensors, same everything — but nope, Samsung said “you can look, but you can’t touch.”\n\nHaving Facer back is great though. I’ve already changed my watch face three times today because apparently commitment isn’t my thing.\n\nAlso, the grouped notifications — chef’s kiss. Finally, my wrist doesn’t look like it’s having a notification panic attack.\n\nOverall, One UI 8 feels like a solid glow-up. Just wish Samsung didn’t sprinkle in that classic “you can’t have this yet” energy.",

The magnetic stand doesn't charge overnight for some reason, and the pad I don't like how finicky alignment can be. I prefer something magnetic if possible but yeah I was wondering what everyone else has. I don't want to get one of those cheap Chinese knockoffs, I've had a bad experience without with my old iPhone, they would burn the cable.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

I noticed a bit of flimsiness and a bit of clang as my arm moves. This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

    "selftext": "I was discovering the features of the One UI 8 on the Galaxy Watch 7, and I expected that, given that they delayed the update for 3 months compared to the rest of the watches that support this feature, it would be supported so that they could wait for the new watches to be sold and then release them to the public, but wow. They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

If you are having an issue when your Galaxy watch goes into a sleep mode where the always on display and raise to wake are being turned off and not turned back on when you wake up, this is for you. Go into your modes and routines and just toggle those settings off in the sleep mode. I know that this is not ideal if you want it to turn on and off automatically however I don't think that having these things on while sleeping really affects wearing the watch much. ",

Can’t wait to see if it motivates me or just roasts me for my “brisk walking” pace.\n\nBut seriously, can someone explain why some of these new features aren’t available on the other Galaxy Watches?\nSame sensors, same everything — but nope, Samsung said “you can look, but you can’t touch.”\n\nHaving Facer back is great though. I’ve already changed my watch face three times today because apparently commitment isn’t my thing.\n\nAlso, the grouped notifications — chef’s kiss. Finally, my wrist doesn’t look like it’s having a notification panic attack.\n\nOverall, One UI 8 feels like a solid glow-up. Just wish Samsung didn’t sprinkle in that classic “you can’t have this yet” energy.",

    "selftext": "I tried using a watch band removal tool to remove the default watch strap from the Dynamic Lug thing, and it worked! It turns out the first-party straps from Samsung are just 22mm watch straps attached to a lug adapter.\n\n------\n\nBackstory: I had been using third-party strap adapter for this watch. I noticed a bit of flimsiness and a bit of clang as my arm moves. This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

Albeit the stress reading was accurate before (ok I only got the watch on Friday) still, since today it's all over the place and as I am lounging at home that doesn't make much sense. I tested it with my old Huawei watch that says I am cool as a cucumber with it, while gw7 on the other arm says I am highly stressed (lol I am not, I should know, I have a masters in psychology lol). Really the only things that would have made this interesting are the vascular load and the anti oxidant index which are not included. All that hype for so little...

Still, I’m happy I didn’t overspend just to chase the newest trend. 😅\n\nNow I’m looking to pick up a **Galaxy Watch Classic** to go with it. I want something that feels premium, lasts a few years, and doesn’t make me feel like I have to upgrade every time Samsung releases a new one. Basically, something that’s good enough to keep and forget about the hype cycle.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n* **Watch 4 Classic** – budget-friendly, but maybe too dated now?\n* **Watch 6 Classic** – seems like the sweet spot for value and performance.\n* **Watch 8 Classic** – newer, but not sure if the price jump is worth it.\n\nFor anyone rocking a Fold + Watch combo:  \nWhich Classic model do you think hits the best balance between **price, features, and longevity**?  \nI’m aiming for that “buy it once and chill” kind of setup.

They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

However, my laptop does not have a 10-bit display and is SDR (8 bits). I updated the AMD and Nvidia graphics card drivers and even downgraded them to previous versions, but it still shows the bit depth as 10 bits.\nI personally suspect that this is a problem with the AMD graphic card driver.

I did like the laptop and it mostly has held up great for me performance wise on games. However, this seems like a crazy amount of money to pay for a nearly 4 year old machine. I don’t want to purchase a new razer at this point, so am looking for alternatives. \n\nOne of the things that matters most to me is look and sound, and the blade was perfect for this. I do game at home, but also need to be able to take my laptop out to cafes and etc to do other productivity tasks without carrying around a huge hunk of gamer metal. Call me shallow, but the “Mac look” of it is something I’d want to preserve in my new laptop. \n\nIs there anything in the 1600 range that would be an upgrade over the 22 blade 14 while maintaining similar aesthetics? \n\nThanks!!

The 288v Ultra 9 really puts in work - CAD, video, picture editing all went very smoothly without major issues, and the 140v integrated graphics are \"good enough\" for most GPU intensive tasks that you could do on a 14 inch - light gaming, blender(ing), and multitasking between those tasks all went well. The integrated \"ai chip\" is useless in my opinion, I don't really use copilot and Google's AI studio does everything better. \n\nCompared to my old pc (Colorful XT gaming pc, 16 gb ram, 3060, i7 h series chip, most tasks actually run significantly better (likely owing to the 32 gbs of ram, and the much better single core performance.) Outside of gaming, the 140v arc graphics is good enough to rival the 3060 in CAD & video editing. The battery life on low power mode is strikingly good, and minimal preference is lost. Very happy with this upgrade! \n\nThe one thing that struck me as particularly annoying was how hot the laptop gets - the laptop gets uncomfortable to use in bed almost instantly. The fans don't seem to kick on until much more computationally intensive tasks, which means even the keys get hot quickly. If you plan on using this laptop in any condition where it has to be on your body, just don't get it. ",

I did two things that solved my problem\n\nThis was written by hand, with love by a human, hope i help someone with this.\n\n1)I limited the thread count to 6 using msconfig.  this means 2pcores, 2ecores will be active and 2ecores disabled.\n\npcores have 2 threads each,\n\n2)I used Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) to limit the package TDP to 15 on \"turbo boost power max\" and \"turbo boost short power max\" to 18w\n\nNow The tdp limit now spreading in 2p cores and 2 ecores, instead of original 2pcores 4ecores.  \nThis gives the P-cores more \"room\" before hitting the thermal throttle, two cores are disabled, not generating heat. This allows the remaining P-cores to operate at their full capacity, and being capable of really using turbo boost\n\nThe TDP is now spreaded across fewer active cores, meaning each core can achieve a higher ndividual power draw \"than when all cores were active. making reaching 4.4 ghz when needed possible, was not possible earlier\n\nWhile this obviously involves the limitation of having two cores disabled, the machine now feels much more responsive, benefiting significantly from improved single-core performance. controlled temps and singlecore CRAAAAZY scores on benchmarks\n\nsinglecore benchmarks were giving not so far results compared my ryzen 7600, on single core,testing bs with 2 p cores + 1 e core xDDDD, not reliable at all at that point but funny,  what a beast the i3 1215u",

Also curious which brands have better PSU/VRM quality and QC.\nShortlist: Lenovo Legion/LOQ, ASUS TUF/ROG, HP Omen, Acer Nitro/Helios, Dell G-series, MSI.\nWhich specific models/configs would you buy or avoid under $1,400, and why?\n",

Pretty much 6-8 months of use, the Lenovo laptop's miniLED panel develops these pink/purple tinted stripes and patches all over (very visible when light colors are displayed). This has happened twice now. Last year they gave me an extra year of warranty, and they literally took 4 repairs to get the monitor swapped right, 1 month of no laptop to use, and on the 3rd repair I was literally sent back a laptop from CSAT Solutions (Houston, TX) without any SSD inside and they tried to lie about it. This time the warranty repair went smoothly, however they are now only offering a 90 day warranty extension on the laptop that is most likely going to fail again in the same way 6-8 months down the line. I don't think I will consider another Lenovo laptop. The service so far has just been bad.\n\nModel: 2023 Lenovo Slim Pro 9i 16IRP8 | Intel 9i-13905H/RAM 32GB/Nvidia 4050/1TB",

Warranty just expired (perfect timing, right? 😭).\n\nTook it to a tech in Italy who cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol. He said he doesn't have ultrasonic equipment and even if he temporarily fixed it, the damage would probably come back. Recommended selling for parts.\n\n**I'm a student and this was my main laptop** for everything. Now I need to sell it fast to help buy a replacement for school.\n\n**What definitely works:**\n\n* Display (perfect, like new) 165hz\n* Battery (low cycles, good health)\n* Keyboard (excellent condition)\n* Charger + original bag like new\n\n**What's dead:**\n\n* Motherboard (won't boot)\n* One RAM slot\n* One fan\n* 1-RAM stick\n* Warranty (expired)\n\n**What's unknown:**\n\n* RTX 4060 (looks clean after cleaning, untested)\n* i7 CPU (same - looks okay, can't test)\n* anything else\n\n**I'm thinking €250** for everything (laptop, charger, bag).

If indifferent, put N/A.** at least 13 inches\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** I would like to run programming and software development apps, as well as capcut\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** I will be running linux as my main operating system. I will be running pycharm on it. Simultaenously, I will be running larkplayer, which is a music app, on an android virtualisation. simultaneouslty, i will be running onenote on a windows virtaulisaion. The laptop must be able to handle at minimum the windows virtualisation and pycharm, but preferably also the android virtualisation\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** I would like 32 gigs of RAM, due to my muiltitasking requirements, and I know that 16gigs isnt going to be enough. As i mentioned earlier, it must have a touch screen. That is the most imporatn factor of all, and is the entire reason for this purchase. I dont particularly care about speaker quality, although the mic and webcam must be good enough that im recognisable (720p for example is fine). Any other features, like being AI certified, are not that important.\n\nI am currently looking at the Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 gen 10 laptop (new), which has a ryzen AI 7 350, a 14 inch 120Hz OLED display, and 32 gigs of RAM, with 1TB of storage. It also has the option to not have an OS, which is useful for me, as I am going to load on linux anyway. Therfore, any suggestions must be a decent amounbt cheaper than £909 for me to consider it, as that is my current best price. [https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83JRCTO1WWGB2](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83JRCTO1WWGB2)\n\nIt costs £909, which is at the very top of my budget (I would prefer something £600-700, and I am fully open to refurbished, due to price savings).\n\nThanks in advcance for any help :)",

I’ve always used the charger that came with it. It used to work perfectly, but about three months ago, it stopped charging after I plugged in the charger. It was strange. I thought maybe my charger was going bad, but then the battery completely drained out, so it didn’t detect the charger at all.\n\nThe next day, Since the Latitude 5300 has a USB power delivery option, I used my iPad charger to charge it. It doesn’t charge when it’s powered on, but it does when it’s powered off (probably because of there ipad chargers W output). it charged with the charger for some time and once it was back to life, I connected the original charger, and it started charging again. \n\nFast forward a couple of months, I started getting the same issue again recently. The original charger doesn’t detect the Latitude 5300. It’s a bit of a hit or miss sometimes; it might be detected one day and not the next. But for the past two days, it hasn’t been charging at all with its original charger.\n\nI asked someone I was browsing for the solution, and they told me that the BIOS needs to be updated. I did that as well, but it still doesn’t detect the charger. What could be the problem, and how do I fix it? If the charger was going bad, it shouldn’t work at all. It charges whenever it feels like and doesn’t when it doesn’t.",

Bonus points if you can comment on thermals/throttling during light video edits and battery life. \n\nUnfortunately, Apple MacBook is a no-no from my workplace :( although, upon researching, Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 AMD 14” and Microsoft Surface 13.8” came on top",

    "selftext": "I just bought the LG Gram laptop 17 inch and discovered a cheaper one with almost the same specs. **Question, is the more expensive model worth the extra $400?** Trying to figure out if I should cancel and buy the cheaper model. Here are the specs. I can't figure out why the ...9u1 model is that much more expensive for just an increase in ram and HD space, in addition the higher priced model has a slower processor and slower Intel Arc Gpu.

Having brought old laptops to life with Linux Mint or Ubuntu before, I figured that would fix things. I had to turn off security in the bios and boot from as USB startup, that I created the correct way. But, it was super slow to even load the bios/boot menu. I also noticed the USB ports were flaky. Two on the left side even feel loose. I think this HP is toast.\n\nOk. You're fine if you fast forwarded to here. I want to purchase a laptop that can be dual boot between Windows 11/ Edubuntu or EndlessOS. That means a big enough SSD for both. I don't want any driver headaches or nonsense, either. So, something fairly standard in parts. It can be used / refurbished.\n\n# \n\n**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase.

If indifferent, put N/A.** N/A\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming?

Otherwise N/A sort of.\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** It must survive a hyper 7 year old. I do not want a touch screen.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** It must have a headphone/line out for audio. Most do anyway. We have a family spotify account she'll be using. Prefer 11/12th gen or newer if Intel. Just dont want it dragging or becoming obsolete right away. 16GB of RAM, minimum!\n\nThank you!

    "selftext": "15\" HP laptop model: BS234wm has broken hinges and trying using super glue and hot glue gun to try and help with some re-inforcement it it worked, but I didn't feel comfortable giving it back because it would just be a short matter of time before it broke again. So Im in the process of cleaning all the glue adhesive from the laptop and restarting.\n\nI have some JB weld Im going to try and use, but wanted to get advice from the community on how to strengthen up this hinge and re-inforce it so it won't happen again. Trying to avoid doing the \"screw through the plastic\" trick, but funcionality is more important than how it looks. I've repaired many laptop hinges over the years; but none of them were this bad of shape. I was thinking of trying to take some thin metal from an old junk laptop that was used for hinges back when they made laptops indestructible lol ( I have a giant box in my shed full old laptops and stuff. btw I also have all sorts of computer repair tools including soldering iron, microscope, hot air station etc.\n\nAny suggestions, tip, or tricks to make this job easier and fixed correctly will be much appreciated. Thanks everyone in advance",

I did like the laptop and it mostly has held up great for me performance wise on games. However, this seems like a crazy amount of money to pay for a nearly 4 year old machine. I don’t want to purchase a new razer at this point, so am looking for alternatives. \n\nOne of the things that matters most to me is look and sound, and the blade was perfect for this. I do game at home, but also need to be able to take my laptop out to cafes and etc to do other productivity tasks without carrying around a huge hunk of gamer metal. Call me shallow, but the “Mac look” of it is something I’d want to preserve in my new laptop. \n\nIs there anything in the 1600 range that would be an upgrade over the 22 blade 14 while maintaining similar aesthetics? \n\nThanks!!

Pretty much 6-8 months of use, the Lenovo laptop's miniLED panel develops these pink/purple tinted stripes and patches all over (very visible when light colors are displayed). This has happened twice now. Last year they gave me an extra year of warranty, and they literally took 4 repairs to get the monitor swapped right, 1 month of no laptop to use, and on the 3rd repair I was literally sent back a laptop from CSAT Solutions (Houston, TX) without any SSD inside and they tried to lie about it. This time the warranty repair went smoothly, however they are now only offering a 90 day warranty extension on the laptop that is most likely going to fail again in the same way 6-8 months down the line. I don't think I will consider another Lenovo laptop. The service so far has just been bad.\n\nModel: 2023 Lenovo Slim Pro 9i 16IRP8 | Intel 9i-13905H/RAM 32GB/Nvidia 4050/1TB",

    "selftext": "Just received my Dell 14 Plus a couple of hours ago. The 288v Ultra 9 really puts in work - CAD, video, picture editing all went very smoothly without major issues, and the 140v integrated graphics are \"good enough\" for most GPU intensive tasks that you could do on a 14 inch - light gaming, blender(ing), and multitasking between those tasks all went well. The integrated \"ai chip\" is useless in my opinion, I don't really use copilot and Google's AI studio does everything better. \n\nCompared to my old pc (Colorful XT gaming pc, 16 gb ram, 3060, i7 h series chip, most tasks actually run significantly better (likely owing to the 32 gbs of ram, and the much better single core performance.) Outside of gaming, the 140v arc graphics is good enough to rival the 3060 in CAD & video editing. The battery life on low power mode is strikingly good, and minimal preference is lost. Very happy with this upgrade! \n\nThe one thing that struck me as particularly annoying was how hot the laptop gets - the laptop gets uncomfortable to use in bed almost instantly. The fans don't seem to kick on until much more computationally intensive tasks, which means even the keys get hot quickly. If you plan on using this laptop in any condition where it has to be on your body, just don't get it. ",

I did two things that solved my problem\n\nThis was written by hand, with love by a human, hope i help someone with this.\n\n1)I limited the thread count to 6 using msconfig.  this means 2pcores, 2ecores will be active and 2ecores disabled.\n\npcores have 2 threads each,\n\n2)I used Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) to limit the package TDP to 15 on \"turbo boost power max\" and \"turbo boost short power max\" to 18w\n\nNow The tdp limit now spreading in 2p cores and 2 ecores, instead of original 2pcores 4ecores.  \nThis gives the P-cores more \"room\" before hitting the thermal throttle, two cores are disabled, not generating heat. This allows the remaining P-cores to operate at their full capacity, and being capable of really using turbo boost\n\nThe TDP is now spreaded across fewer active cores, meaning each core can achieve a higher ndividual power draw \"than when all cores were active. making reaching 4.4 ghz when needed possible, was not possible earlier\n\nWhile this obviously involves the limitation of having two cores disabled, the machine now feels much more responsive, benefiting significantly from improved single-core performance. controlled temps and singlecore CRAAAAZY scores on benchmarks\n\nsinglecore benchmarks were giving not so far results compared my ryzen 7600, on single core,testing bs with 2 p cores + 1 e core xDDDD, not reliable at all at that point but funny,  what a beast the i3 1215u",

So Im in the process of cleaning all the glue adhesive from the laptop and restarting.\n\nI have some JB weld Im going to try and use, but wanted to get advice from the community on how to strengthen up this hinge and re-inforce it so it won't happen again. Trying to avoid doing the \"screw through the plastic\" trick, but funcionality is more important than how it looks. I've repaired many laptop hinges over the years; but none of them were this bad of shape. I was thinking of trying to take some thin metal from an old junk laptop that was used for hinges back when they made laptops indestructible lol ( I have a giant box in my shed full old laptops and stuff. btw I also have all sorts of computer repair tools including soldering iron, microscope, hot air station etc.\n\nAny suggestions, tip, or tricks to make this job easier and fixed correctly will be much appreciated.

I don’t want to purchase a new razer at this point, so am looking for alternatives. \n\nOne of the things that matters most to me is look and sound, and the blade was perfect for this. I do game at home, but also need to be able to take my laptop out to cafes and etc to do other productivity tasks without carrying around a huge hunk of gamer metal. Call me shallow, but the “Mac look” of it is something I’d want to preserve in my new laptop. \n\nIs there anything in the 1600 range that would be an upgrade over the 22 blade 14 while maintaining similar aesthetics? \n\nThanks!!

But I'd like to be prepared in case I ever need to and I want a workstation that can last me a good while.\n\nI live near a microcenter so I can get a 9950x3d and a MSI PRO X870E-P WIFI ATX AM5 for 779.99. As far as I'm aware the MSRP for 9950x3d is 629.99 so I'm not sure if $150 for X870E is good, if the deal itself in general is good? Either way I'm willing to spend on a 9950x3d as long as its within budget (which it is currently). But if anyone can give an input on this that'd be great! I've looked at benchmarks and this seems like the best in terms of productivity, just for some reason I can't seem to find many benchmarks on Maya.\n\nI've also decided to pair it with a 5070ti so I'm wondering if that's a good pairing? It seems like the best bang for buck out of the 50 series.\n\nAnd if those parts are good I just want to be sure all the other parts are compatible. I've done some things like checking the ram clearance of the cpu cooler, but as I've said this is my first time building so generally I have no idea what to look for in terms of whether the parts fit. Any things I should take note of?",

I have a 5090 suprim liquid and I’m not sure which to pair it with, to my understanding, the 9800x3d is the best cpu for gaming. I know the i9 would be best for pretty much everything including workloads and not much of a difference between both CPU’s when playing at higher resolutions. But just a curious question to which one actually performs better at 4K even if the average is 1 fps higher. Also to mention this rig will be 99% for gaming. I just keep seeing benchmarks between the two for 1080p and not 4K. And I know the am5 platform is gunna stick for a while longer and intel keeps changing platforms but this is strictly about performance. ",

    "selftext": "###Troubleshooting Help:\n\n**What is your parts list? [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**\n\nCPU: Intel i7-12700k\n\nGPU: PNY RTX 5080 \n\nMotherboard: MSI Z690-A Pro (no Wi-Fi)\n\nNetwork Adapter: Intel(R) Ethernet Controller (3) I225-V\n\n\nI built this computer in 2022.\n\n\n**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**\n\n\nAs the title says, I'm experiencing slow download speeds on my desktop PC which I built myself, compared to my laptop, phone, PS5, and any other device connected to my network. My internet plan is a fiber connection capable of 1000mbps speeds. My laptop, phone, PS5 downloads stuff at around 400-500mbps. However, when I run a speed test on my desktop, I cap out at around 80mbps, and Steam downloads games at only 30-40mbps.\n\n\n**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**\n\n\n1. Updated my network adapter drivers. As mentioned above, my motherboard's network adapter is Intel's I225-V. I tried disabling the adapter, uninstalling it, redownloading the latest drivers from Intel's website, restarting my PC, and installing the downloaded drivers. Nothing changed.\n\n2. Used a USB 3.0 ethernet adapter capable of 1000mbps download speeds. No change.\n\n3. Swapped out the ethernet cable. The cable isn't the issue; I've tried connecting it to my laptop, and I get the usual high speeds (400mbps+) I mentioned before.\n\n4. Updated my BIOS. Didn't change anything.\n\nAt this point, I think it's either a software issue (some program throttling my internet speed on my desktop), or a more serious hardware issue beyond my ethernet adapter (since the slow download speeds remain even when using the USB ethernet adapter). \n\n\n**Provide any additional details you wish below.**\n\n\nIt's important to note that I upgraded my internet plan a year ago. Before that, I was on an internet plan that maxed out at 250mbps (but of course I didn't exactly reach that speed). I figured that my speeds were always normal, until I upgraded my network plan and tried using the internet on other devices. \n\nThanks for the help. I wasn't sure if this was the right subreddit to post this in, but I'm getting kind of desperate--I just want to use the internet speed I pay for on my PC!",

    "selftext": "I had just finished rehousing my PC into larger case (a Fractal Meshify 2 XL) and just closed the side panel when it happened. Fortunately it happened outside the case, unfortunately it was not plunged in so there was no ground for the charge to dissipate into. The PC boots ok but I am still feeling a little spooked. I am hoping that because the charge had the whole case and PC to dissipate into it did not hit any sensitive components too hard. If it made it to the motherboard it would have likely been through the grounding standoffs but I don't know if that is good or bad. If anyone with more electrical knowledge can chime in I would appreciate it.\n\n\n\nThe irony here is that the whole reason I redid my pc is because I had bought a smaller case than I wanted in order to avoid a having a glass panel but ended up caving later. Guess where the static charge came from? from peeling the the protective plastic off the glass panel I did not want in the first place. Watch out when out peeling plastic protective film as it can cause you to build a static charge. I normally wear an ESD band but had taken it off because I was no longer working with internal components.\n\n\n\nAs a couple bonus tips to anyone reading or coming from Google later:\n\nYou can fit a Arctic Freezer III 420 with push pull fans (37mm rad + 2* 27mm fans) just fine up top in a Fractal Meshify 2 XL.\n\nThe Arctic Freezer III AM5 mounting system sucks and is a pain to install. I found that loosening the left bracket, starting the threading on both AIO screws, and only then tightening everything down is much easier than doing it the \"correct\" way. The problem is the the AIO screws are under tension and are prone to only letting you get one screw stated before flexing and making it impossible to thread the other screw. They don't even give you any locating pins to help hold the cold plate in aliment while you try to screw it in.",

I started by checking out the Corsair RM850E at a good price, but I read right here that it’s a rather noisy model, and I don’t know how annoying that might be — my old PSU is a Corsair Plus White from many years ago and honestly, it's noisy under heavy load. But I’m not sure if this model would have the same issue or if it would be noisy all the time.\n\nBecause of that, I saw the MSI MAG A850GL at a very good price (€98), but I know absolutely nothing about that PSU. Then I’ve also looked at the Corsair RM850X for €145, which I understand is Corsair’s best model. I know that the PSU is one of the most important components of a PC and where it’s worth spending money, but I’d like to clear up my doubts about these three PSUs.\n\nMy new components (except for the 3 hard drives) are:\n\nMB: ASUS Rog Strix B650E-F GAMING WIFI\nCPU: Ryzen 7 7700X 4.5GHz\nRAM: Kingston Fury BEAST 32GB (2x16) 6000MT/s CL30\nSSD: Kingston 120GB\nSSD: Kingston 1TB\nHDD: SeaGate 1TB\nCooler: Hiditec C20PRO\nGPU: Gigabyte RTX 5070 WINDFORCE 12GB GDDR7\n\nLastly, I want to thank anyone who helps me decide on a PSU.",

I bought a prebuilt PC years ago with little actual PC knowledge at the time and since, I've upgraded almost the entire PC since which is why I'm in this subreddit and not the prebuild one, cause I may have to rebuild it.\n\nMost recently, the CPU. I put in a Ryzen 9 5900XT onto my existing AS Rock B450M/ac which was supposed to be compatible. However, any time I boot up any game, the PC dies. Doesn't even blue screen, just straight up powers down instantly. I've read and heard so many mixed reviews about both that CPU and various B550 motherboards and some X570's and was wondering if there was a recommendation on a motherboard that can ACTUALLY work with that processor and my other components.\n\nMy current build is this https://pcpartpicker.com/list/JHBX4p unless I have to do a complete new build which I'd rather avoid. The board I've been thinking about getting is the Gigabyte Eagle but I don't know what to trust if this B450 I have doesn't work.",

I need to plan it out in advance though in case parts shipping takes a while.\n\nI want to potentially revive this as my workstation. My main questions:\n\n* I will most likely need a better CPU if I wanna use this full time - thinking about AM5 - can I reasonably get an AIO in there with good airflow for all the parts? The case has a bit of top ventilation - would a 240 AIO be installable in there? Then there's a front fan for intake.\n* Since I basically have no way to reuse any of the current parts, would it be easier to just toss this case and start over? I kinda want to reuse it for sentimental reasons, but if there's no point then there's no point.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I just built my first PC and everything has gone well so far, but I noticed that the power cables that came with my PSU were sticking out too far for the case I chose. It became noticeable when I booted up my PC for the first time and noticed it was artifacting badly. I resolved it by removing the glass case until my new 90 Degree power supply cables arrive. However, there now appears to be an issue thats causing minor artifacting when I boot up my PC but it resolves itself after a minute or 2. I ask this question because I am afraid I might have damaged any pins or slots when I installed my GPU or when the power cables were pushed against the GPU by the glass. I also noticed that the GPU support bracket the comes with the case was pushing the gpu a little too high, so I loosened it until it was barely touching the GPU. Could this mean something was damaged or is this a nonissue and I should be fine?\n\nThank you\n",

    "selftext": "I'm sure posts like these are a dime a dozen on this sub, so apologies if I'm inadvertently double-posting. Frankly I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the GPU options, and looking for some guidance.\n\nI rebuilt my desktop back in 2022, and at the time couldn't afford a GPU upgrade. Everything else was rebuilt, but I held onto my old card. Well, this GTX 1060 6GB card that I've been rocking since 2016 has served me admirably, but it is time to put it out to pasture. Since I haven't had my head in the game for about 10 years, my initial attempts to find a good, mid-tier replacement card have been overwhelming with options. Options are a good thing! But 7800XT this vs RX 6800 non XT that, vs 5060Ti over there, vs Intel b580 around the corner (what is \"arc\" anyway?) - I just don't know what I'm looking at, let alone what would work for my current specs. Part of the problem is *anything* will be miles better than my current card.\n\nI'm **not** looking to upgrade any other components of the build at this time...though if there is a strong case to be made, let me know. I have never gamed at the bleeding edge of the market - most of my gaming is a combination of strategy, city builder, and simulation games, or games that released a couple years prior once they're on sale - which rarely need high-end specs. But, even that is starting to put a strain on my old pal.\n\nCurrent build:\n\n* EVGA 650 GA PSU\n* AMD Ryzen 5 5600\n* x2 1440p monitors\n* ASUS TUF Gaming B550M-PLUS (if it matters)\n* mATX case\n\nTypical gaming needs: BG3, Cities Skylines 2, No Man's Sky, strategy games like Civ. I play a couple action RPGs like Cyberpunk 2077, RDR2 (amazingly my little 1060 has trucked along through them, though with much lowered settings), but I don't need maxed settings on those. I don't need Raytracing. I don't need an FPS above 60. Frankly I tolerate 30+ FPS all the time, but I'd love for the ability to crank up settings to highish and still get 60. Honestly the biggest trigger for the upgrade has been swapping to 1440p monitors (which I love once I made the jump!). I also recognize that I should be future-proofing this, i.e. aiming higher than current needs so I'm set for a while yet.\n\nSince I have an AMD processor, I'm generally fine swapping over to an AMD card - no specific NVidia allegiance.\n\nBudget: ~~Well, I went into this hoping for sub $300...but I recognize that may not be attainable. I'd love to stick close to that if at all possible, and really want to avoid spending more than $400ish. But there is some flexibility.~~ See edit below.\n\nReally appreciate whatever recommendations you can spare.\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing that my budget was pretty unrealistic. Appreciate the clarity on this! I think I can push to $500 if necessary, especially if the argument is to be able to better future proof my needs.",

I absolutely can’t get my pc to install windows from usb stick. \n\nI have tried win 11, win 10 and even win 11 installed with rufus. \n\nBest results I had with rufus, the installer crashed twice at 36% (no error code), Win 10 doesn’t even boot to first installer window and ”normal” win 11 boot drive doesn’t get past product key check.\n\nI have tried removing second m2 ssd, gpu, second ram stick and I have tried having secure boot on and off. I also updated bios to the newest version. Expo is disabled.\n\nComponents I have are; 9950x3d, 5080, 128gb ddr5, 2x 990 pro and X870 aorus elite. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions how do I get windows installed?",

    "selftext": "Hello, all! I recently found my old desktop from college in a closet when moving my kids into their own rooms, and I thought it might be nifty to upgrade it! It was never super powerful, but it played a lot of what I used to play, albeit on low settings for the most part. It also got really bogged down when I was doing a lot of different things, so what’d I really like to get out of this:\n\n- Upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 without the system chugging or being unresponsive\n- Play Endless Space 2 on High settings. I am a big 4x fan, and this is an all time favorite.\n- Play Endless Legend 2 on low — no idea how realistic this is, but I’d be nice.\n- Modded Minecraft\n- Open Office; I miss spreadsheets, they stink on my phone\n- Discord and virtual D&D tools; I’d like to get back into the hobby!\n- Testing software; I don’t know what else to call this, but my wife and I both have to take certification exams and continuing education courses. We have a laptop we do them in, but it is very slow and unreliable.\n- Maybe Moonlight? I hear I can play PC games on my iPad with it, and I’d love to play Endless Space on my iPad! :D\n\n##### Current Hardware :\n\n- **Motherboard** : [Gigabyte GA-Z68P-DS3](https:/www.newegg.com/gigabyte-ga-z68p-ds3-atx-intel-motherboard-intel-z68-lga-1155/p/N82E16813128520?item=N82E16813128520&_gl=1*1tolf7s*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NjEwNDI5NTMuQ2p3S0NBand1OWZIQmhBV0Vpd0F6R1JDXzFCUXJJa0didzRtM3FBcy1JM0ltQjNBZG9RZFYxS0VqdVNSSEtRMTRWQU5hU256MXM2WVNSb0MwNE1RQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_dc*R0NMLjE3NjEwNDI5NTMuQ2p3S0NBand1OWZIQmhBV0Vpd0F6R1JDXzFCUXJJa0didzRtM3FBcy1JM0ltQjNBZG9RZFYxS0VqdVNSSEtRMTRWQU5hU256MXM2WVNSb0MwNE1RQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTgxODg0ODQzOC4xNzYwOTg0Mjgz*_ga*MTk1NTAyNDQzMC4xNzYwOTg0Mjg0*_ga_TR46GG8HLR*czE3NjEwNzc3MzIkbzgkZzEkdDE3NjEwNzgwMTAkajQ5JGwwJGgxOTExMjY4ODUy)\n- **Processor** : [Intel Core i3-2100 -

Beyond those two:\n\n- As far as I can tell, this chip is super affordable _and_ the best my motherboard can take, I just need to update my BIOS. I’ve also read I can overclock this using my motherboard, but probably will need a better cooling setup? I assume this is the best overall upgrade I can make?\n- I have no idea what kind of cooler I need, but between overclocking and the new video card I assume I need one. The Hyper 212 seems highly recommended? I just can’t seem to find one that says it is for my chipset? Is there something better? \n- For the RAM,  it looks fairly affordable to upgrade to 32 GB 1600. I assume this is what I want to be doing next, since more RAM is never bad?\n- I have my 1TB HDD, but SSDs are highly recommended, but also seem a lot more expensive. I assume the drive I selected here should work well as my install drive with stuff I use a lot, with my old drive as effectively a storage drive? And that should be the last big upgrade I need?\n- I have a WiFi card in one of my other slots and know I have no USB3, but I don’t know that I need it? I’d kind of like an SD card slot, but maybe just a usb 2 adapter is fine? Is there anything else I need?\n\nAnd that’s where I am at! Thanks for any help or insight!\n",

    "selftext": "I was initially waiting for a Black Friday sale or something but after checking some price history graphs, the GPUs and CPUs in my country get considerably more expensive from mid-November all the way to end of January - I have also noticed on these graphs that they are right now basically at an all-time low price (in my country) - so I have decided to pull the trigger on the GPU and CPU now (planning to buy in a day or MAX two days)  \n\nWon't go too much into the details of the planned build but I will provide some context and my current build so you guys get an idea of the circumstances - this current rig is 7-8 years old so it's time is due soon\n\nI **CURRENTLY** HAVE -  \n\n**CPU: i7 8700 @ 3.2GHz**   \n**GPU: GIGABYTE Windforce GTX 1060 6GB GDDR5**  \n**RAM: 32GB DDR4-3200MHZ Dual Channel Corsair Vengeance** \n\nThis rig is **ANCIENT**\n\nI will **NEVER** game above 1080p. I still even have a 60Hz monitor (planning to go 144 at some point, but PC comes first). The only games I intend to play are Path of Exile, Path of Exile 2 & League of Legends.  \n\nLeague of Legends' requirements are a joke and I don't even need a new PC for that.  \n\nEverywhere I've searched on the internet/Reddit I always only see the high-end perspective, gaming at 1440, 2K, 4K whatever\n\n**Path of Exile and Path of Exile 2** have my interest though - on the current PC they still function but I would like better performance AND they are **CPU-intensive** games, with that said -  \n\n**PLANNED** BUILD \n\n**CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 4.7GHz** - I am investing more in the CPU than I will on the GPU (imo) \n\n**GPU:**\n\nI was looking at either NVIDIA's 5070 or AMD's 9070    \nThe **GIGABYTE WINDFORCE 12GB RTX 5070 OC ( & non-OC )** are the *cheapest* ones in my country but even right now I see fairly recent posts on the internet that the issue with thermal paste pads whatever leaking is still a thing.  \n\nNext cheapest is **ASUS/ASUS PRIME 12GB** and they also seem to have a bad image to people when it comes to customer service.  \nThere's also MSI & Palit at similar prices (I only looked at 3-fan variants here)     \nI REALLY don't want to have to deal with RMA-ing a product  \nThe last option is **Sapphire Radeon RX 9070 XT PULSE 16GB** - this would be more expensive than these mentioned above, but *significantly*(\\~$100) cheaper than a 5070 Ti  \n\nNow for added context from my previous context - as I said, I currently have a 1060 6GB, this GPU doesn't have any of this new technology like DLSS, RT or FSR.    \nThe posts from the internet I see always argue about these systems, but in my case, I literally don't have any of these right now. I will never feel the lack of them, because I don't know what it's like to have them.  \n\nSurely my performance can't possibly by impacted by the lack of whatever I will miss out given I will be upgrading all the way from a 1060 on based on what I will choose based on you guys' feedback, right?",

    "selftext": "Hi all, looking to build a Dual GPU setup one for my main Linux OS and then a second GPU passed through to a Windows VM for Solidworks. I do some gaming and pretty happy of the state of gaming on Linux, probably don't plan on using the VM to game. Id ideally like to add a NIC as well to give dedicated network access to any VMs.\n\nIve been currently working off a Ryzen 5600X and single 3060ti and its feeling its limits. \n\nIve been seeing some seemingly decent priced CPU & mobo combos on Ebay that support the needed PCIE lanes. Specifically a 3970X CPU and a TRX40-Pro S motherboard. Is this a good route to go down? Because I think I would be comfortable starting here. \n\nProbably will look for 64-128gb of ram any recs? I see the 3970x maxes out at DDR4 @ 3200 MT/s. is this too limiting? It would be an upgrade for me from 2x8gb DDR4 @ 2667MT/S. Cant say Id notice the speed bump but id appreciate at least 32gb per OS, preferably more for overhead. 16gb has been suffocating the past few months. \n\nFor GPUs I'm looking at a used Rx6700xt for the Linux Host and either reusing my 3060ti for the VM or getting a used RTX a2000 on ebay for its Solidworks performance. Leaning to buying a the a2000 so I can use the 3060ti in my homelab (no more software transcoding for me, hooray!). \n\nIs there a better used AMD card for the host, price/ performance/ age?\n\nI can confidently figure out power supply and storage and case but would appreciate any help/ guidance with anything above!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI would appreciate your assistance upgrading my PC. I bought a friend's gaming computer back in 2017. It still works fine, but it's finally at about the point where I have to upgrade it. It cannot run Windows 11 due to its old motherboard and it struggles with some games (e.g. Diablo III, Baldur's Gate, some HTC Vive games). I'm trying to decide what is the best way to upgrade it while balancing value, performance, and long-term upgradability. I'd like to continue to leverage useful components, but I'm not hard-pressed. I don't have a hard budget, but I'll say somewhat arbitrarily in the vicinity of $1,000 - I'm not sure what's reasonable. I'm in Northern Virginia. \n\nI'm fairly confident that the first thing I need to upgrade is the motherboard, but the knock-on effects of replacing that are throwing me as I'm not experienced with building computers. I feel like replacing the motherboard will also necessitate buying a new processor, cooling unit, and RAM, but that feels like a lot to change out at once.\n\n are my existing system's components:\n\nHere\n\n* Motherboard: [MAXIMUS VII HERO](https://www.asus.com/us/supportonly/maximus_vii_hero/helpdesk_knowledge/)\n* Processor: [Intel Core I7 4770K - 3.5 Ghz - 4 Cores - 8 Threads - 8 Mb Cache - Lga1150 Socket - OEM](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-I7-4770K-Threads/dp/B00E7LPH24/ref=sr_1_1?crid=11DXYSHBL68YK&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yrw6K2FW_Ombt8nHmTyaDqEX2UCsK_hadCyu6X4Q9GByyTEZu4msffCqL3wkWz-Hhzle7BUWhfv0Q2ZKHViQOUvJI4Hb52JDf54DiEmboFY8jN0t5R3z4gTxusPea2uRDKYhDQV0HqsnfFU0jYKJmdnogQzeIVQ00gOTN4UVicGzwVFk_KYmxj5lHnlgrHZu00hC6TTIUp5mcqnb2VtJo2mfXgFk9h2M5Wp8IloZmiTLZuIySCKmiYph77MisEOYFvjUI97yyl966QDEdrh77ebzwYoDApxqyQ8vjjovCAg.X_ndFA3KX8v_vjtZ2RMyt9eIQnZU8sxOLWvfvikIirI&dib_tag=se&keywords=Intel%28R%29+Core%28TM%29+i7-4770K+CPU+%40+3.50GHz%2C&qid=1761091326&s=electronics&sprefix=intel+r+core+tm+i7-4770k+cpu+3.50ghz%2C%2Celectronics%2C115&sr=1-1)\n* RAM: 16 GB [Adata XPG 2x8GB DDR3 1866 SDRAM AX3U1866W8G10-BGV Desktop Ram](https://securis.ws/products/adata-xpg-2x8gb-ax3u1866w8g10-bgv-desktop-ram)\n* Graphics card: [NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 Specs | TechPowerUp GPU Database](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-970.c2620)\n* Hard drives:\n   * [Samsung Electronics 840 EVO-Series 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Single Unit Version Internal Solid State Drive MZ-7TE500BW](https://www.amazon.com/DISCONTINUED-Samsung-2-5-Inch-Internal-MZ-7TE500BW/dp/B00E3W19MO?th=1)\n   * [Toshiba DT01ACA200 2TB 7200 RPM 3.5\" Internal Bare/OEM Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-DT01ACA200-7200-Internal-Drive/dp/B009CPDI62?th=1)\n* Monitor: [ASUS TUF 34 Inch Curved Gaming Monitor - WQHD (3440x1440), 165Hz, 1ms, Extreme Low Motion Blur, FreeSync Premium, Eye Care, Height Adjustable, DisplayHDR 400, DisplayPort, HDMI, USB - VG34VQL1B : Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LCMYT54?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_4&th=1)\n* Power supply: [Corsair HX Series, HX1200, 1200 Watt, Fully Modular Power Supply, 80+ Platinum Certified, Model Number: CP-9020140-NA](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MZ8A8NW?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3&th=1)\n   * The old power supply died back in late 2022, so I replaced it.\n* Case: [NZXT H440 Mid-Tower Case Review - PC Case - Tom’s Hardware | Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nzxt-h440-case-review,3734.html)\n   * Minor inconvenience: one of the top USB 2.0 ports doesn't work anymore.\n* Cooling: Corsair [Hydro Series™ H60 High Performance Liquid CPU Cooler (Refurbished)](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/refurb-cpu-coolers/cw-9060007-ww-rf/cw-9060007-ww-rf?srsltid=AfmBOoqz6IqfXcy4_NowjFBDXYYUw8Ee7LRfkj11GI5Ff0uHUijHHZ4w)\n* Mouse: [Logitech G502 SE Hero 910-005728 Wired Gaming Mouse - Black](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-910-005728-Wired-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B084TDNPTS)\n* Keyboard: [Dacoity Gaming Keyboard, Full Size RGB Backlit Quiet Computer Keyboard, Wrist Rest, Silent Keys, Multimedia Keys, Anti-ghosting, Waterproof Light Up USB Wired Keyboard for PC Mac Xbox Gamer Office](https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Dacoity-Multimedia-Anti-ghosting-Waterproof/dp/B0BQC4GB3T?th=1)\n\nHow would you all recommend I go about upgrading, and to what?

    "selftext": "I had a PC at my parents house that I recently brought back after not using it for a long time. After booting up, I get about 1 minute of time before the CPU overheats and then the whole computer shuts down with no warning. I know the CPU is overheating because when I turn it back on I get a  \"CPU Overheating alert\" before it shuts back off.\n\n  \nIt's an NZXT pre-build that has an AIO. I've done the following to troubleshoot:\n\n* Felt the AIO tubes to make sure fluid is pumping through them (feels fine)\n* Checked that the exhaust fan for the AIO is running\n* Replaced the thermal paste on the CPU - AIO interface\n* Turned the PC on and tilted it in all directions in attempt to clear air bubbles\n* Turned the PC on and pressed the AIO down onto the CPU to ensure good contact\n* Booting to BIOS and watching the CPU Temperature\n\n  \nAfter all of those troubleshooting steps, I see the temperature rise steadily from around 50c to 91c before the computer shuts down even from BIOS. This is the same behavior as before I tried anything.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure what else to do at this point besides replace the CPU, motherboard, or AIO, but wanted to see if there's anything else I should try.

    "selftext": "\n\nHello everyone, hope you are having a great day/night. \n\nMy cousin came over the weekend and I played him the 1st hour of clair obscur expedition 33. He is not a big gamer, but he has liked indie titles like little nightmares and we played a demo from reanimal. He appreciates good atmosphere graphics and stories so I knew he would love coe33 as he hasn't played anything similar to it(even if there is anything haha). \n\nHe is now hooked and he just moved into his first house by himself. He doesn't know anything about computers and as I am the one in the family who kinda knows his stuff.\n\n The problem I have when trying to recommend him something though is that I have a 5080 and I play at 1440p While he has a 4k tv that he wants to game on and no GPU that can go near 4k.\n\n His system is an am4 system with a 2600x and 16gigs of ram. Do you think a 5070 with dlss on performance would cut it for 4k clair obscur? Maybe lowering some settings? Will the CPU be able to keep up? 4k is not too tough on the CPU but as the CPU is a bit old I am thinking it might even have trouble with the engine itself. Maybe even ram should be expanded but that is a pretty easy upgrade.\n\nDo you guys think 12gbs for 4k is too low even for lowered settings? I think that my cousin will be satisfied with the fidelity of dlss 4 performance and if his tv goes above 60hz(he doesn't know, I would have to check when I go over)  he can even try out frame gen. He is mostly a controller player so even some extra latency would go unnoticed. Is the 5070 worth considering? \n\nI don't really like the amd side as not many games have fsr 4 compared to dlss 4 and especially at 4k using dlss on performance is a great performance boost while on a budget while also lowering vram requirements.

    "selftext": "My friend made me a question the other day \"which is better 4060 ti 8gb or 9060 xt 8gb?\" I instantly said neither, 8gb of vram is enough and surely there is something better in the used market for that price. But the more I thought about it the less true that became.\n\nIt is true that newer and non optimized titles need more than 8gb, but is there really anything that is equal or better in that 9060 xt 8gb price range? You can find the powercolor model for 270 in amazon. Excluding games that need more than 8gb, it destroys anything else in price to performance. I cant even find an equivalent in the used market for that price.\n\nIf it later in its life drops to around 250, wouldnt it just be the defacto card, the 16gb version is significantly more expensive at 350 USD.\n\nSo, im asking, is it actually that bad? And what price do you think it needs to be to be good?\n\n  \n  \nSome extra stuff. Im thinking of upgrading at some point in the next year and so it my friend, so we are looking for gpus. We have massive import taxes on items over 200. Anything over 200 has a 20% tax added so a 250 USD card becomes a 300 USD so the lower the better. If you have any recommendations for what cards are good right now, new or used im all ears.",

    "selftext": "\nI’m apologizing in advance if this post has the most horrendous format ever, I’m writing this from my phone.\n\nSo last night my cat had zoomies and body slammed into my PC, thus knocking it over. I caught it mid-air so it didn’t make impact to the ground. \n\nI’m a little knowledgeable but not… phenomenally or remarkably, so when I noticed the Bluetooth on my PC was “not turned on” I immediately unplugged it, opened it up and took a look inside.\n\nVisually, nothing looks wrong other than some mild sagging of my GPU, which I fixed by just tightening it back up and I managed to fix the Bluetooth issue by just pressing on it to make sure it was in place, figured it was fixed because everything seemed to be working fine and went to bed.\n\nWoke up this morning, booted it up to work on some things and my keyboard, mouse and headphones were disconnecting and reconnecting every 10-15 seconds and I just now fixed it by simply just plugging them into different ports (still pending testing, who knows at this point, might still be an issue after posting this)\n\nI’ve never had any USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi issues until the fire nation (my cat) attacked last night.\n\nAs of right now, Bluetooth is back to not working. I guess I’m wondering if I need to go back in and look for physical issues again and if so, what should I be looking for??\n\nI have the ASRock A320M/ac, so the Bluetooth/wifi component is built into the motherboard, hence my hesitation to go in there messing with it without some sort of 3rd party insight.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar issue and can point me in the right direction I’d be appreciative.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI went caveman style and started (gently) pushing anything I could see. Booted it up, everything works fine now. I have no idea which component was causing it but I am gonna wait and see if it happens again. For now, it’s running fine and my cat is indefinitely banned from being within 6 feet of my PC.\nHe has no remorse. He screamed in my face earlier.\n\n",

I just keep seeing benchmarks between the two for 1080p and not 4K.

    "selftext": "I had just finished rehousing my PC into larger case (a Fractal Meshify 2 XL) and just closed the side panel when it happened. Fortunately it happened outside the case, unfortunately it was not plunged in so there was no ground for the charge to dissipate into. The PC boots ok but I am still feeling a little spooked. I am hoping that because the charge had the whole case and PC to dissipate into it did not hit any sensitive components too hard. If it made it to the motherboard it would have likely been through the grounding standoffs but I don't know if that is good or bad. If anyone with more electrical knowledge can chime in I would appreciate it.\n\n\n\nThe irony here is that the whole reason I redid my pc is because I had bought a smaller case than I wanted in order to avoid a having a glass panel but ended up caving later. Guess where the static charge came from? from peeling the the protective plastic off the glass panel I did not want in the first place. Watch out when out peeling plastic protective film as it can cause you to build a static charge. I normally wear an ESD band but had taken it off because I was no longer working with internal components.\n\n\n\nAs a couple bonus tips to anyone reading or coming from Google later:\n\nYou can fit a Arctic Freezer III 420 with push pull fans (37mm rad + 2* 27mm fans) just fine up top in a Fractal Meshify 2 XL.\n\nThe Arctic Freezer III AM5 mounting system sucks and is a pain to install. I found that loosening the left bracket, starting the threading on both AIO screws, and only then tightening everything down is much easier than doing it the \"correct\" way. The problem is the the AIO screws are under tension and are prone to only letting you get one screw stated before flexing and making it impossible to thread the other screw. They don't even give you any locating pins to help hold the cold plate in aliment while you try to screw it in.",

    "selftext": "I'm sure posts like these are a dime a dozen on this sub, so apologies if I'm inadvertently double-posting. Frankly I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the GPU options, and looking for some guidance.\n\nI rebuilt my desktop back in 2022, and at the time couldn't afford a GPU upgrade. Everything else was rebuilt, but I held onto my old card. Well, this GTX 1060 6GB card that I've been rocking since 2016 has served me admirably, but it is time to put it out to pasture. Since I haven't had my head in the game for about 10 years, my initial attempts to find a good, mid-tier replacement card have been overwhelming with options. Options are a good thing! But 7800XT this vs RX 6800 non XT that, vs 5060Ti over there, vs Intel b580 around the corner (what is \"arc\" anyway?) - I just don't know what I'm looking at, let alone what would work for my current specs. Part of the problem is *anything* will be miles better than my current card.\n\nI'm **not** looking to upgrade any other components of the build at this time...though if there is a strong case to be made, let me know. I have never gamed at the bleeding edge of the market - most of my gaming is a combination of strategy, city builder, and simulation games, or games that released a couple years prior once they're on sale - which rarely need high-end specs. But, even that is starting to put a strain on my old pal.\n\nCurrent build:\n\n* EVGA 650 GA PSU\n* AMD Ryzen 5 5600\n* x2 1440p monitors\n* ASUS TUF Gaming B550M-PLUS (if it matters)\n* mATX case\n\nTypical gaming needs: BG3, Cities Skylines 2, No Man's Sky, strategy games like Civ. I play a couple action RPGs like Cyberpunk 2077, RDR2 (amazingly my little 1060 has trucked along through them, though with much lowered settings), but I don't need maxed settings on those. I don't need Raytracing. I don't need an FPS above 60. Frankly I tolerate 30+ FPS all the time, but I'd love for the ability to crank up settings to highish and still get 60. Honestly the biggest trigger for the upgrade has been swapping to 1440p monitors (which I love once I made the jump!). I also recognize that I should be future-proofing this, i.e. aiming higher than current needs so I'm set for a while yet.\n\nSince I have an AMD processor, I'm generally fine swapping over to an AMD card - no specific NVidia allegiance.\n\nBudget: ~~Well, I went into this hoping for sub $300...but I recognize that may not be attainable. I'd love to stick close to that if at all possible, and really want to avoid spending more than $400ish. But there is some flexibility.~~ See edit below.\n\nReally appreciate whatever recommendations you can spare.\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing that my budget was pretty unrealistic. Appreciate the clarity on this! I think I can push to $500 if necessary, especially if the argument is to be able to better future proof my needs.",

I'm running bf6 around 50 to 80 frames per second. Curious if getting a better CPU (Since my CPU on Task manager appears to be at 100%) would squeeze some more FPS and not sit at 100% usage rate. \n\nI know the easier answer is to get a new MOBO and all that jazz. Just curious if I would see a bigger increase in it. \n\nThanks",

    "selftext": "###Troubleshooting Help:\n\n**What is your parts list? [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**\n\nCPU: Intel i7-12700k\n\nGPU: PNY RTX 5080 \n\nMotherboard: MSI Z690-A Pro (no Wi-Fi)\n\nNetwork Adapter: Intel(R) Ethernet Controller (3) I225-V\n\n\nI built this computer in 2022.\n\n\n**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**\n\n\nAs the title says, I'm experiencing slow download speeds on my desktop PC which I built myself, compared to my laptop, phone, PS5, and any other device connected to my network. My internet plan is a fiber connection capable of 1000mbps speeds. My laptop, phone, PS5 downloads stuff at around 400-500mbps. However, when I run a speed test on my desktop, I cap out at around 80mbps, and Steam downloads games at only 30-40mbps.\n\n\n**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**\n\n\n1. Updated my network adapter drivers. As mentioned above, my motherboard's network adapter is Intel's I225-V. I tried disabling the adapter, uninstalling it, redownloading the latest drivers from Intel's website, restarting my PC, and installing the downloaded drivers. Nothing changed.\n\n2. Used a USB 3.0 ethernet adapter capable of 1000mbps download speeds. No change.\n\n3. Swapped out the ethernet cable. The cable isn't the issue; I've tried connecting it to my laptop, and I get the usual high speeds (400mbps+) I mentioned before.\n\n4. Updated my BIOS. Didn't change anything.\n\nAt this point, I think it's either a software issue (some program throttling my internet speed on my desktop), or a more serious hardware issue beyond my ethernet adapter (since the slow download speeds remain even when using the USB ethernet adapter). \n\n\n**Provide any additional details you wish below.**\n\n\nIt's important to note that I upgraded my internet plan a year ago. Before that, I was on an internet plan that maxed out at 250mbps (but of course I didn't exactly reach that speed). I figured that my speeds were always normal, until I upgraded my network plan and tried using the internet on other devices. \n\nThanks for the help. I wasn't sure if this was the right subreddit to post this in, but I'm getting kind of desperate--I just want to use the internet speed I pay for on my PC!",

But the more I thought about it the less true that became.\n\nIt is true that newer and non optimized titles need more than 8gb, but is there really anything that is equal or better in that 9060 xt 8gb price range? You can find the powercolor model for 270 in amazon. Excluding games that need more than 8gb, it destroys anything else in price to performance. I cant even find an equivalent in the used market for that price.\n\nIf it later in its life drops to around 250, wouldnt it just be the defacto card, the 16gb version is significantly more expensive at 350 USD.\n\nSo, im asking, is it actually that bad? And what price do you think it needs to be to be good?\n\n  \n  \nSome extra stuff. Im thinking of upgrading at some point in the next year and so it my friend, so we are looking for gpus. We have massive import taxes on items over 200. Anything over 200 has a 20% tax added so a 250 USD card becomes a 300 USD so the lower the better. If you have any recommendations for what cards are good right now, new or used im all ears.",

I have a 5090 suprim liquid and I’m not sure which to pair it with, to my understanding, the 9800x3d is the best cpu for gaming. I know the i9 would be best for pretty much everything including workloads and not much of a difference between both CPU’s when playing at higher resolutions. But just a curious question to which one actually performs better at 4K even if the average is 1 fps higher. Also to mention this rig will be 99% for gaming. I just keep seeing benchmarks between the two for 1080p and not 4K. And I know the am5 platform is gunna stick for a while longer and intel keeps changing platforms but this is strictly about performance. ",

    "selftext": "\nI’m apologizing in advance if this post has the most horrendous format ever, I’m writing this from my phone.\n\nSo last night my cat had zoomies and body slammed into my PC, thus knocking it over. I caught it mid-air so it didn’t make impact to the ground. \n\nI’m a little knowledgeable but not… phenomenally or remarkably, so when I noticed the Bluetooth on my PC was “not turned on” I immediately unplugged it, opened it up and took a look inside.\n\nVisually, nothing looks wrong other than some mild sagging of my GPU, which I fixed by just tightening it back up and I managed to fix the Bluetooth issue by just pressing on it to make sure it was in place, figured it was fixed because everything seemed to be working fine and went to bed.\n\nWoke up this morning, booted it up to work on some things and my keyboard, mouse and headphones were disconnecting and reconnecting every 10-15 seconds and I just now fixed it by simply just plugging them into different ports (still pending testing, who knows at this point, might still be an issue after posting this)\n\nI’ve never had any USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi issues until the fire nation (my cat) attacked last night.\n\nAs of right now, Bluetooth is back to not working. I guess I’m wondering if I need to go back in and look for physical issues again and if so, what should I be looking for??\n\nI have the ASRock A320M/ac, so the Bluetooth/wifi component is built into the motherboard, hence my hesitation to go in there messing with it without some sort of 3rd party insight.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar issue and can point me in the right direction I’d be appreciative.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI went caveman style and started (gently) pushing anything I could see. Booted it up, everything works fine now. I have no idea which component was causing it but I am gonna wait and see if it happens again. For now, it’s running fine and my cat is indefinitely banned from being within 6 feet of my PC.\nHe has no remorse. He screamed in my face earlier.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I had just finished rehousing my PC into larger case (a Fractal Meshify 2 XL) and just closed the side panel when it happened. Fortunately it happened outside the case, unfortunately it was not plunged in so there was no ground for the charge to dissipate into. The PC boots ok but I am still feeling a little spooked. I am hoping that because the charge had the whole case and PC to dissipate into it did not hit any sensitive components too hard. If it made it to the motherboard it would have likely been through the grounding standoffs but I don't know if that is good or bad. If anyone with more electrical knowledge can chime in I would appreciate it.\n\n\n\nThe irony here is that the whole reason I redid my pc is because I had bought a smaller case than I wanted in order to avoid a having a glass panel but ended up caving later. Guess where the static charge came from? from peeling the the protective plastic off the glass panel I did not want in the first place. Watch out when out peeling plastic protective film as it can cause you to build a static charge. I normally wear an ESD band but had taken it off because I was no longer working with internal components.\n\n\n\nAs a couple bonus tips to anyone reading or coming from Google later:\n\nYou can fit a Arctic Freezer III 420 with push pull fans (37mm rad + 2* 27mm fans) just fine up top in a Fractal Meshify 2 XL.\n\nThe Arctic Freezer III AM5 mounting system sucks and is a pain to install. I found that loosening the left bracket, starting the threading on both AIO screws, and only then tightening everything down is much easier than doing it the \"correct\" way. The problem is the the AIO screws are under tension and are prone to only letting you get one screw stated before flexing and making it impossible to thread the other screw. They don't even give you any locating pins to help hold the cold plate in aliment while you try to screw it in.",

    "selftext": "I'm sure posts like these are a dime a dozen on this sub, so apologies if I'm inadvertently double-posting. Frankly I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the GPU options, and looking for some guidance.\n\nI rebuilt my desktop back in 2022, and at the time couldn't afford a GPU upgrade. Everything else was rebuilt, but I held onto my old card. Well, this GTX 1060 6GB card that I've been rocking since 2016 has served me admirably, but it is time to put it out to pasture. Since I haven't had my head in the game for about 10 years, my initial attempts to find a good, mid-tier replacement card have been overwhelming with options. Options are a good thing! But 7800XT this vs RX 6800 non XT that, vs 5060Ti over there, vs Intel b580 around the corner (what is \"arc\" anyway?) - I just don't know what I'm looking at, let alone what would work for my current specs. Part of the problem is *anything* will be miles better than my current card.\n\nI'm **not** looking to upgrade any other components of the build at this time...though if there is a strong case to be made, let me know. I have never gamed at the bleeding edge of the market - most of my gaming is a combination of strategy, city builder, and simulation games, or games that released a couple years prior once they're on sale - which rarely need high-end specs. But, even that is starting to put a strain on my old pal.\n\nCurrent build:\n\n* EVGA 650 GA PSU\n* AMD Ryzen 5 5600\n* x2 1440p monitors\n* ASUS TUF Gaming B550M-PLUS (if it matters)\n* mATX case\n\nTypical gaming needs: BG3, Cities Skylines 2, No Man's Sky, strategy games like Civ. I play a couple action RPGs like Cyberpunk 2077, RDR2 (amazingly my little 1060 has trucked along through them, though with much lowered settings), but I don't need maxed settings on those. I don't need Raytracing. I don't need an FPS above 60. Frankly I tolerate 30+ FPS all the time, but I'd love for the ability to crank up settings to highish and still get 60. Honestly the biggest trigger for the upgrade has been swapping to 1440p monitors (which I love once I made the jump!). I also recognize that I should be future-proofing this, i.e. aiming higher than current needs so I'm set for a while yet.\n\nSince I have an AMD processor, I'm generally fine swapping over to an AMD card - no specific NVidia allegiance.\n\nBudget: ~~Well, I went into this hoping for sub $300...but I recognize that may not be attainable. I'd love to stick close to that if at all possible, and really want to avoid spending more than $400ish. But there is some flexibility.~~ See edit below.\n\nReally appreciate whatever recommendations you can spare.\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing that my budget was pretty unrealistic. Appreciate the clarity on this! I think I can push to $500 if necessary, especially if the argument is to be able to better future proof my needs.",

Are my temperatures normal with a 360mm AIO, first time user of Arctic and kinda wondering if I should of got another EKWB Nucleus CR360. Anywho, everything is mounted in an EVO RGB case with 10x 120mm fans. \n\nCPU temps in bios 40-41c\n\nCPU idle in Windows 51-53c\n\nCPU under load 65-73c (BF6) \n\nGPU under load 60-65c (BF6)\n\nRunning 4k res avg 120-140fps on medium settings.\n\nSo are these temps normal? Room temp is on Avg 23c but after a bit of gaming even with a fan on tends to get hotter so assuming this contributes to CPU/GPU temps under load increasing\n",

    "selftext": "Hi! This is my first pc build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VRqFRV\n\nI work with 3D software such as Maya, Blender, Houdini. Also some editing but not at the professional level yet. But I'd like to be prepared in case I ever need to and I want a workstation that can last me a good while.\n\nI live near a microcenter so I can get a 9950x3d and a MSI PRO X870E-P WIFI ATX AM5 for 779.99. As far as I'm aware the MSRP for 9950x3d is 629.99 so I'm not sure if $150 for X870E is good, if the deal itself in general is good? Either way I'm willing to spend on a 9950x3d as long as its within budget (which it is currently). But if anyone can give an input on this that'd be great! I've looked at benchmarks and this seems like the best in terms of productivity, just for some reason I can't seem to find many benchmarks on Maya.\n\nI've also decided to pair it with a 5070ti so I'm wondering if that's a good pairing? It seems like the best bang for buck out of the 50 series.\n\nAnd if those parts are good I just want to be sure all the other parts are compatible. I've done some things like checking the ram clearance of the cpu cooler, but as I've said this is my first time building so generally I have no idea what to look for in terms of whether the parts fit. Any things I should take note of?",

I just find them so appealing, I enjoy playing them causally/f2p and just building what the game sorta rolls me over time. \n\nBut lately I’ve really been having an urge to find and play one, really sink my teeth into something for a while. And I found marvel future fight, a game I played what feels like a decade ago but never stuck with it. But these last few months I’ll log in and do my little daily whatever and there’s so many random heroes and I’m just having a blast with it. \n\nBut when I search for something newer, maybe better, just anything… I can’t seem to find anything that is super p2w or just bad and scammy. I don’t even mind p2w mechanics, again, I play so causally I couldn’t care about pvp and arena ranks for the most part. \n\nFinally realized I’m dumb and I should ask the actually mother ship itself. \n\nYou guys got anything like this I could check out?",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

It’s pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound’s coming from. I don’t see any technical reason why we can’t have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "In this chat, Gooseman opens up about the challenges of starting from zero, which he's had to do more than once in his career. I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

    "selftext": "Just wondering thoughts of you guys on this. Why would anyone buy something like Doom The Dark Ages which in Europe costs 80 € btw (thats 93 $). When you can rent game by getting 1 month of pc game pass (15 € after price hike which is still reasonable). The game has about 12 hours of content from what I've seen.\n\n  \nAnd down the line if you wanna replay it you can probably buy it for much lower price on sale anyway. Just don't get paying 80 € for game. \n\nFYI: for some reason some companies are pricing games at 70 $/80 €, while others are doing 70 $/70 €. ",

We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

    "selftext": "**Hey, r/pcgaming!**\n\n**I’m Louis Denizet, game director at** [Hibernian Workshop](https://hibernian-workshop.com/)**, the indie studio behind the roguelite** [Astral Ascent](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280930/Astral_Ascent/) **— and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have!**\n\nI started the studio years ago after meeting Alexandre Magnat online — we were both self-taught and completely obsessed with pixel art, especially the kind you see in anime across different eras and styles. \n\nWhat followed after a few years since this match was Astral Ascent, a colorful, fast-paced roguelite in the vein of Dead Cells with a focus on fluid combat, replayability (with 5 unique characters to choose from), and wrapped up in a pixel art style that’s by now become a signature of our work. \n\nIt wasn’t our first game, but it’s the one where we finally found our footing. A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I’d describe the thematic heart of AA and we’ve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It’s also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we’re still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe’ve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We’ve learned a lot from our past games — Astral Ascent most of all — and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project… which, truth be told, probably won’t be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that’s the short of it about us.\n\nIt’s been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that’s to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We’re excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

I’ve always been a big fan, from early pokemon days, played summoners war for years when it first came out, games like that. I just find them so appealing, I enjoy playing them causally/f2p and just building what the game sorta rolls me over time. \n\nBut lately I’ve really been having an urge to find and play one, really sink my teeth into something for a while. And I found marvel future fight, a game I played what feels like a decade ago but never stuck with it. But these last few months I’ll log in and do my little daily whatever and there’s so many random heroes and I’m just having a blast with it. \n\nBut when I search for something newer, maybe better, just anything… I can’t seem to find anything that is super p2w or just bad and scammy. I don’t even mind p2w mechanics, again, I play so causally I couldn’t care about pvp and arena ranks for the most part. \n\nFinally realized I’m dumb and I should ask the actually mother ship itself. \n\nYou guys got anything like this I could check out?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

I’ve always been a big fan, from early pokemon days, played summoners war for years when it first came out, games like that. I just find them so appealing, I enjoy playing them causally/f2p and just building what the game sorta rolls me over time. \n\nBut lately I’ve really been having an urge to find and play one, really sink my teeth into something for a while. And I found marvel future fight, a game I played what feels like a decade ago but never stuck with it. But these last few months I’ll log in and do my little daily whatever and there’s so many random heroes and I’m just having a blast with it. \n\nBut when I search for something newer, maybe better, just anything… I can’t seem to find anything that is super p2w or just bad and scammy. I don’t even mind p2w mechanics, again, I play so causally I couldn’t care about pvp and arena ranks for the most part. \n\nFinally realized I’m dumb and I should ask the actually mother ship itself. \n\nYou guys got anything like this I could check out?",

While it’s black, I hear the classic Windows “device disconnected” sound, and when the image comes back, the screen is noticeably dimmer.\n\nTo fix it temporarily, I press Ctrl + Shift + Win + B to reset the graphics driver, and it returns to normal.\n\nThis used to happen very occasionally, but starting yesterday it’s now happening every 10 minutes.\n\nOut of curiosity, I let the screen stay dim (without resetting the driver), and played 3 full matches like that — interestingly, the issue didn't happen again during that time. So it feels like the “flicker” only occurs when the system is trying to restore the image to its original brightness or state.\n\nSpecs:\n\nGPU: RX580\n\nMonitor: Acer VG271S (connected via DisplayPort)\n\nWhat I’ve tried (no success):\n\nClean reinstallation of GPU drivers using DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller)\n\nPhysically cleaned the GPU (removed and dusted it)\n\nTried a DisplayPort cable with pin 20 removed\n\nChanged Windows power plan settings\n\nAdjusted all monitor settings (Acer VG271S)\n\nUsed CRU (Custom Resolution Utility) to modify resolution settings\n\nEnabled/disabled FreeSync\n\nLowered refresh rate (Hz)\n\nAt first, I thought this was a monitor issue, but it only happens when using the PC, so I believe it's something related to the GPU, driver, or maybe a power/detection issue.\n\nIf anyone has experienced this or has any suggestions, I'd really appreciate the help!

I didn't see any delivery on my house's cameras and didn't see anything the following days either despite saying it's been delivered already...\n\nI looked around my neighborhood the day after and waited to see if it was \"pre-scanned as delivered\" like their site said and still nothing... \n\n  \nI went through the claim process, and the day after they asked for a police report which I found a little strange since I had footage showing that there were no deliveries through the day, but I ended up filing one anyways and filling out a form to get my own copy within a few business days (it was the weekend however).\n\nFast forward to today where I got my report pretty quickly HOWEVER the claim was denied and closed due to inactivity. After a couple calls to their customer service I was able to get the report to them only for them to claim that my report isn't an official police report??\n\nAfter a THIRD call to customer service, they say that it looks legitimate and that they'll give it to claims only to send another email to me stating that they can't proceed with it because my report doesn't have a signature of the officer who FILED the report, despite having the name and signature of the officer who processed my request...\n\n  \nI'm honestly just planning to file for a charge back at this point, but is Newegg just bad now or am I incredibly unlucky?? I've been dealing with this back and forth for about a week now and the claim hasn't even begun to get processed because of these weird requirements they need from my report",

    "selftext": "(Pictures attached below) Bought the MSI G274QPX less than 2 years ago, probably about 1 year and 6 months, and it had some weird stuff happen to it some times (Like the lower side of the screen looks torn and all you could see is static but after turning it on and off, it goes away. This also happens when you boot up the PC while it's loading, then you get to the log in screen and it's just gone like it never happened), to name a few. Yes, I do use the PC for work, Zoom meetings, playing games like Call of Duty Warzone, watching movies, YouTube etc. and I believe it's still moderate use case, borderline heavy, probably averaging 10 hrs a day.\n\nDidn't pay attention to it then since it resolved itself, and that shouldn't really be an issue, since my older Xiaomi Mi Surface 34\", about 5 or 6 years old at this point, has had no issues aside from actual screen tearing from playing games. I predominantly do the gaming on the MSI monitor for higher frames and not much of the workload etc. (which can still be pretty high demand since I have a lot of Google Chrome tabs open.\n\nNow, my MSI monitor is having these intermittent lines pop up throughout the length of the whole monitor and it becomes very distracting when working, especially when watching stuff on the other monitor since you get to focus on the lines instead of the movie/anime or whatever it is.\n\nI've already tried turning the monitor on and off, turning the whole PC off, restarting, checking for AMD software updates (previously had a 3060Ti here not sure if this can cause an issue since even after uninstalling there seems to be some leftover Nvidia software on the PC), swapped DP cables, swapped where it's inserted in the GPU slots, I also tried it on HDMI (Issue is much worse there), tried connecting it to my Mac too still showing the issue.\n\nAlso, putting pressure on the bezel, makes the behavior of the intermittent lines more erratic no matter where I put pressure on it. Currently trying to see if it's still under warranty, store still hasn't gotten back to me.\n\nAny thoughts on what else I can do aside from taking it to a reputable store to have it repaired / buying a new one?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1fao6xsnakwf1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c0fa20f48eb8b6dd07ded9e99b6698a7f532dba\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wumhvsnakwf1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b42a9687b1a48b53a79c70e0a6ebfe89becf5f7\n\n",

When I initially installed CoD, it was like 29gb or something.  I'm hoping that's an extra 100gb of data that was somehow missing from the initial install and was causing the game to crash. I'm typing this all out as I wait for that install to finish. Anyway, let me know what you guys think. Thank you!\n\n  \nEdit: Whatever was in that random 129gb install fixed it. Why all required files wouldn't install when I downloaded the game the first time, is beyond me.",

    "title": "My theory about what MS actually plans to do with gaming",
    "selftext": "It seems MS got the message they should have gotten years ago with the threat of SteamOS, given how their plans for the future have been ever changing these last years. Given that many people believe their expensive console - multiple stores - hybrid console/PC strategy makes no sense, here I am giving you my 2 cents. \n\nWindows have been known to be sluggish/resource hungry and that is mainly part of the way they are built - which is for being an everything OS that runs from demanding brand-new programs to running a 90s .exe on a hospital in some Balkan country (insert infuriating data collection as well here). No matter what they do, Windows will always be \"slower\" for specific task - in this case gaming - because it caters to many many different use case scenarios. Consoles are made to \"just\" play games (now how well they do that is another convo), so their OS's and programs are being made specifically for that.  Add the fact that they have  a specific HW combo they need to run on and u get much easier lower-level access in your approach on building for them. That's one of the main reasons why these devices do recompiling as well. \n\nThe last couple of years SteamOS arrived and showed that the modularity of Linux, allows Valve to approach their OS as they would do in a console -> far less bloat -> easier lower-level access -> significant perf gains across a multitude of games. The perf diffs are honestly embarrassing for MS, millions of people are using PCs for gaming, and these PCs run Windows. If SteamOS, Bazzite (or any other OS) arise as a truly logical and feasible alternative, then Windows is as good as dead in the long run.\n\nThat is why I believe they are finally starting to take action about this. If Windows lose PC OS market share, then all of their adjacent product sales (and do take into consideration all the data they collect and then sell) will plummet. \n\nSo, here is what I believe they are trying to do, based on what we know (leaks as well): With the next Windows installment - call it Windows 12 or whatever else they will call it - they will \"modulize\" the OS core. The result will be a hybrid core that support both Legacy and standard APIs (Win32 for example) AND a new game core with low-level APIs/toolsets , like the Xbox does. With that, they will be able to improve the gaming part of the OS while not messing with the compatibility of the OS. Game devs will have the option to chose between what they know how to work with (Win32 + DX11/12) or these new toolsets that will be much more performant. The result will be an Xbox interface that truly runs just the part of the OS needed for gaming and a \"seamless\" transition between this gaming environment and full Windows (plus XPA will be standardized, given that every game built will be a PC one). Also, the fact that they are making a line of APUs for next gen of different perf tiers, but with the chiplet design, leads me to believe that they are trying to change the way drivers work as well -> precompiling -> more console-like experience that reduces stuttering.\n\nNow comes the realism part. While this sounds awesome about the future of PC gaming, MS is still, well, MS and they WILL find a way to f this up. From making these toolsets a hustle to use (just like the current Xbox ones), to fumbling this initiative in the most stupid way possible. Let's hope this time they don't...\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "i have my pc setup with dual monitors and use one of them for my switch occasionally. i wanted to be able to hear my switch and pc audio in the same time, so i connected a 3.5mm audio cable between the monitor and pc mic in. i have the pc listen to the device to get the switch audio through. that’s good with no issues, but i noticed my hyperx cloud ii wireless headset now has an electronic buzzing noise when they’re on. i just unplugged the audio cable and it immediately stopped, so im guessing there’s some interference there. the buzzing is there even when my switch is off. only unplugging the cable works. \n\ni was wondering if there was a simple solution to keep my switch audio connected to my pc but stop the buzzing in my headset\n\ni did already try plugging my headset usb into different ports on the back and front with no luck.

There's an option in Game Bar's settings for whether it responds to the button, but it appears to do nothing if Full Screen Experience is enabled.\n\n\\* Steam BPM sometimes appears in a thumbnail-sized window, with no apparent fix other than to restart\n\n\\* Steam BPM sometimes takes up only part of my 4K screen, as if it's sized to 1080p or 1440p (I'm not sure which) within the 4K grid. \n\n\\* It's too easy to wind up on a Windows dialog or other screen that isn't responsive to controller input. This includes some of the widgets available for Game Bar. \n\nAnyone running into some or all of these?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’ve got a new PC build and am dealing with a super strange issue.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* GPU: **ASRock RX 9060 XT Challenger 16 GB** (dual-fan)\n* CPU: **Ryzen 9600X**\n* RAM: 32 GB \\*\\*XPG Lancer DDR5-6000\n* Case: **Thermaltake S200** tg  white(compact mid-tower)\n* Cooler: **Thermaltake** astria 200\n* PSU: **XPG Core Reactor 850W Gold**\n* **motherboard: B650 gigabyte gaming series x ax v1.5 (bios up to date)**\n\n**The issue:**  \nWhile playing **Cyberpunk 2077** at max settings, my GPU fans make a **drilling/rubbing-air noise** once they ramp past \\~50-70% (around \\~1500- 2300RPM).  \nBUT:\n\n* The noise does **not** occur in any other game (including heavy ones).\n* The noise also does **not** appear in synthetic benchmarks or stress tests.\n* When I reset everything to default (no custom fan curve, no undervolt) the noise *immediately* disappeared.\n* Under heavy load (two games open at once: Spider‑Man 2 + Monster Hunter Wilds), temps are great (GPU \\~60-66 °C, hotspot \\~86 °C) and fans stay under \\~40%/\\~1300 RPM — no noise.\n* The noise can only be reproduce again if i manually set a custom fan curve that goes beyond 2000 rpm (70%). \n\n**What I tried:**\n\n* Removed leftover plastic film on the GPU cooler.\n* Opened the case (while powered off) and cleaned dust with a microfiber cloth. ( all components are new, i bought it a week ago)\n* Reseated the PSU power cable (after hearing a small “tick/spark” when it wasn’t fully inserted).\n* Switched GPU/PSU/RAM to defaults (no custom curves/no undervolt/ no underclock).\n* Tested other fans (case, PSU) to isolate the noise to the GPU fan area.\n\n**Current verdict:**\n\n* No sign of instability or damage — system is stable.\n* My suspicion: Not a bearing issue (since no mechanical noise at low RPM), but probably a **design or acoustic resonance issue** (fan vs case vs airflow) triggered specifically by Cyberpunk’s load.\n* The store/tech says: unless there’s a **mechanical defect** (fan grinding, wobble) reproducible under standard conditions (no undervolt/underlock nor custom fan curve), they cannot  RMA ( I live in south america) — synthetic tests run fine and other games are quiet.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* Should I just keep using it and monitor?\n* If the fans work perfectly under 40% RPM and temps are fine, is this just a weird design quirk rather than a fault? mabye an airflow issue as the chassis is small?\n* Could long-term use in that noise zone (40-70% RPM) *eventually* harm the fan or GPU cooling, or is it safe since it never actually hits high RPM / high temps?\n\n\\* Thank you in advance. \n\n**TL;DR:**  \nNew RX 9060 XT build—fan noise “drilling” only in Cyberpunk when fans ramp high; resets to default ( no oc/underlock / custom fan curve) eliminate noise; everything else fine.",

    "selftext": "I had my MSI 5090 Suprim Liquid for five months without any issues until yesterday. Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA’s foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI’m totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card… \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I’m usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can’t believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately. I’m aware this is an MSI product, but Nvidia insist that every manufacturer uses this horrible connector.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI have reached out to MSI for a warranty claim, but they told me I need to get in touch with my local vendor Scan.\nScan initially accepted the request but wanted me to pay for shipping and insurance of that 8lb box on my own dime, as it is a \"damaged goods return\". And insuring such an expensive box turns out to be quite pricey.\n\nThis morning they suddenly changed their stance and a pre-paid courir will pick it up tomorrow.\nThis is likely due to this post, which I have mentioned in my correspondence with customer support. \n\nI can't thank you enough for all the upvotes and I'll keep you posted on this.\n\n \nRE choice of cable: Many of you have pointed out not to use the included MSI cable and instead the 12v6x2 from my Corsair PSU, which most PSUs won't even provide. When I built the PC I've watched this video https://youtu.be/6FJ_KSizDwM?si=MTw-3uioJ0wdiR_M&t=486 which strongly recommends not to use the Corsair PSU cable because of the bad quality and instead use the MSI cable which was praised for it's quality.\n\nDo with this information what you want, but it seems the current consensus is to use the PSU cable.",

It’s weirdly emotional seeing it all together after building it piece by piece. I’ve been testing everything nonstop gaming, editing, stress tests and on the side.

    "title": "My theory about what MS actually plans to do with gaming",
    "selftext": "It seems MS got the message they should have gotten years ago with the threat of SteamOS, given how their plans for the future have been ever changing these last years. Given that many people believe their expensive console - multiple stores - hybrid console/PC strategy makes no sense, here I am giving you my 2 cents. \n\nWindows have been known to be sluggish/resource hungry and that is mainly part of the way they are built - which is for being an everything OS that runs from demanding brand-new programs to running a 90s .exe on a hospital in some Balkan country (insert infuriating data collection as well here). No matter what they do, Windows will always be \"slower\" for specific task - in this case gaming - because it caters to many many different use case scenarios. Consoles are made to \"just\" play games (now how well they do that is another convo), so their OS's and programs are being made specifically for that.  Add the fact that they have  a specific HW combo they need to run on and u get much easier lower-level access in your approach on building for them. That's one of the main reasons why these devices do recompiling as well. \n\nThe last couple of years SteamOS arrived and showed that the modularity of Linux, allows Valve to approach their OS as they would do in a console -> far less bloat -> easier lower-level access -> significant perf gains across a multitude of games. The perf diffs are honestly embarrassing for MS, millions of people are using PCs for gaming, and these PCs run Windows. If SteamOS, Bazzite (or any other OS) arise as a truly logical and feasible alternative, then Windows is as good as dead in the long run.\n\nThat is why I believe they are finally starting to take action about this. If Windows lose PC OS market share, then all of their adjacent product sales (and do take into consideration all the data they collect and then sell) will plummet. \n\nSo, here is what I believe they are trying to do, based on what we know (leaks as well): With the next Windows installment - call it Windows 12 or whatever else they will call it - they will \"modulize\" the OS core. The result will be a hybrid core that support both Legacy and standard APIs (Win32 for example) AND a new game core with low-level APIs/toolsets , like the Xbox does. With that, they will be able to improve the gaming part of the OS while not messing with the compatibility of the OS. Game devs will have the option to chose between what they know how to work with (Win32 + DX11/12) or these new toolsets that will be much more performant. The result will be an Xbox interface that truly runs just the part of the OS needed for gaming and a \"seamless\" transition between this gaming environment and full Windows (plus XPA will be standardized, given that every game built will be a PC one). Also, the fact that they are making a line of APUs for next gen of different perf tiers, but with the chiplet design, leads me to believe that they are trying to change the way drivers work as well -> precompiling -> more console-like experience that reduces stuttering.\n\nNow comes the realism part. While this sounds awesome about the future of PC gaming, MS is still, well, MS and they WILL find a way to f this up. From making these toolsets a hustle to use (just like the current Xbox ones), to fumbling this initiative in the most stupid way possible. Let's hope this time they don't...\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Another 5090 down in flames",
    "selftext": "I had my MSI 5090 Suprim Liquid for five months without any issues until yesterday. Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA’s foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI’m totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card… \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I’m usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can’t believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately. I’m aware this is an MSI product, but Nvidia insist that every manufacturer uses this horrible connector.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI have reached out to MSI for a warranty claim, but they told me I need to get in touch with my local vendor Scan.\nScan initially accepted the request but wanted me to pay for shipping and insurance of that 8lb box on my own dime, as it is a \"damaged goods return\". And insuring such an expensive box turns out to be quite pricey.\n\nThis morning they suddenly changed their stance and a pre-paid courir will pick it up tomorrow.\nThis is likely due to this post, which I have mentioned in my correspondence with customer support. \n\nI can't thank you enough for all the upvotes and I'll keep you posted on this.\n\n \nRE choice of cable: Many of you have pointed out not to use the included MSI cable and instead the 12v6x2 from my Corsair PSU, which most PSUs won't even provide. When I built the PC I've watched this video https://youtu.be/6FJ_KSizDwM?si=MTw-3uioJ0wdiR_M&t=486 which strongly recommends not to use the Corsair PSU cable because of the bad quality and instead use the MSI cable which was praised for it's quality.\n\nDo with this information what you want, but it seems the current consensus is to use the PSU cable.",

Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

I was able to make the MagSafe mount for $8 and the monitor riser I made myself by using the same dimensions from various manufacturers. \n\nRocking a 34” LG ultra-wide and man I love it. Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "A quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

    "selftext": "I recently picked up this Hummingbird68 for $49+shipping (30ish bucks to the USA, if I recall) as a way to mess around with an HE Keeb: [https://clickclack.io/products/click-clack-x-kochi-hummingbird68-magnetic-switch-mechanical-keyboard-kit](https://clickclack.io/products/click-clack-x-kochi-hummingbird68-magnetic-switch-mechanical-keyboard-kit)\n\nStock the quality is shocking for the price, the case is well made, feels decent, sounds okay if a bit loud for my tastes, keycaps are solid, ect. The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

    "selftext": "Sidegraded from a K5 Max with reds to a K5 V2 with Banana\n\nKeeping this super short, and for the full size keeb lovers:\n\nCons: \n\nLoses 2.4 dongle capability vs Max (could be a pro for some, like me. I removed the battery since i Wire in and don't want a spicy pillow)\n\nABS keycaps. Bad texture on fingernails (akin to nails on chalkboard feeling but smoother). Swapped to PBT 'hacker' keyset from keychron. Much better.\n\nSwitching keys loses shine-thru (expected, just unfortunate)\n\nPros:\n\nVery thocky banana. The insulation in the K5 V2 rivals the K5 Max. I'd love to try low profile silent or milk POM red.\n\nThe new banana switch is also MUCH more tactile than my old optical mint on the og K5 Optical  \n\nChassis is same as K5 Max to the point internals or bottom plate are interchangeable\n\nStronk backlighting.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

Here's the link for F108 Pro (you can search for the others on their site):\n\n[https://aulakeyboard.com/product/aula-f108-pro/](https://aulakeyboard.com/product/aula-f108-pro/)\n\nThere's Keychron Q6, but I hate the knob position:\n\n[https://keychron.net.br/pt/products/keychron-q6-qmk-tecladomecanicopersonalizado?srsltid=AfmBOoqCbCbC18iLNDkQEUTDxdqPd9j0wFKEN5vK5Mus2kB85GjmFlEV](https://keychron.net.br/pt/products/keychron-q6-qmk-tecladomecanicopersonalizado?srsltid=AfmBOoqCbCbC18iLNDkQEUTDxdqPd9j0wFKEN5vK5Mus2kB85GjmFlEV)\n\nThen if you're a rich guy you can customize a GMMK Pro (U$ 500+):\n\n[https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk-3-configurator?step=1&language=English+%28US%29&size=100%25&connectivity=Wired&configSwitchTechnology=Standard+Hotswap+%28MX%29&configPcbOrientation=North-facing&configLayout=ANSI&bottomCase=Black&topCase=Black&switches=Fox+Ultralight+MX&keycaps=Classic+Black&os=Windows&badge=Black&rotaryKnob=Jet+Black&cable=Standard+Black&gasketModules=Firm+%28Silicone%29&switchPlate=Silver+Aluminum&defaults.keycaps=Backlit+Black&defaults.bottomCase=Black%2CJet+Black](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk-3-configurator?step=1&language=English+%28US%29&size=100%25&connectivity=Wired&configSwitchTechnology=Standard+Hotswap+%28MX%29&configPcbOrientation=North-facing&configLayout=ANSI&bottomCase=Black&topCase=Black&switches=Fox+Ultralight+MX&keycaps=Classic+Black&os=Windows&badge=Black&rotaryKnob=Jet+Black&cable=Standard+Black&gasketModules=Firm+%28Silicone%29&switchPlate=Silver+Aluminum&defaults.keycaps=Backlit+Black&defaults.bottomCase=Black%2CJet+Black)\n\n**If you don't need hotswap**\n\nThen there's plenty of options. But I really want hotswap. Here's some of them. I won't link all link, just look for them:\n\nDas Keyboard (several)\n\nSpectre Pro\n\nSteelseries Apex\n\nMountain Everest\n\nThermaltake (several)\n\nMajestouch ninja\n\nLeopold (several)\n\nCoolmaster (several)\n\nCherry keyboards (several)\n\nAdesso (several)\n\niONE Scorpius\n\nLogitech K845\n\nMax Keyboard\n\nTurtle Beach (several)\n\nRosewill (several) speacially Neon K90\n\nCougar Attack X3\n\nAJazz AK35i\n\nCorsair (several) ",

It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper.\n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone as some reccomended it to me but GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust AI 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at an odd location. \n\nWhat other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI have posted this to Geek Hack also, but it's been over a week and my post has not been approved. I messaged the moderator of the Geek Hack interest checked forums, and they have not replied yet. So I thought I would make this post here also.\n\nI've got the prototype complete. If you guys have any suggestions of where I should sell this or if anyone would like to partner with me, please let me know.\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**ANSI60**\n\nA 4mm keyboard plate with multiple layout support.\n\n**Supported Layouts**\n\n* Split Backspace\n* Split Right Shift\n* Stepped Caps Lock\n* 7u Spacebar\n\n[Supported Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YHOHfZDZJXJPjWIfWgxHSUXzf9Ksx9y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Aluminum\n* Polycarbonate (PC)\n\n**Compatibility**\n\n* **Mounting styles:** Tray Mount\n* **Form factor:** 60% ANSI\n\n**Supported PCBs**\n\n* Venom HE 60% PCB\n* GH60 and DZ60 variants\n* Wooting 60HE\n\n\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~|\\~\n\n**Introduction / Vision**\n\nIntroducing the **ANSI60** — a 4mm keyboard plate crafted for enthusiasts seeking to push the boundaries of typing acoustics and feel.   \nAt nearly three times the thickness of a standard 1.5mm plate, the ANSI60 transforms vibrational behavior, producing a crisper, more rounded tone with a fuller frequency response across the sound spectrum.\n\nMore than just thicker — the ANSI60 delivers a distinct typing experience unlike standard 1.5mm plates. With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

A few of them are close in tone, but I’ve been staring at them too long to know what actually works anymore.\n\nBefore I commit to a final direction (samples are already ordered), I’d really appreciate input on:\n\n• Which of the 6 colourways you guys think works best and would compliment your boards nicely?\n\n• Any suggestions for alternate colours for either the characters themselves or the gradient?\n\n• Any that feel like instant no-gos?\n\nI know loud designs aren’t for everyone, but feedback and input either way is appreciated.\n\nOnce the samples arrive I’ll post real photos - and if they print terribly, I’ll disappear into a hole forever.\n\nCheers",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "I recently picked up this Hummingbird68 for $49+shipping (30ish bucks to the USA, if I recall) as a way to mess around with an HE Keeb: [https://clickclack.io/products/click-clack-x-kochi-hummingbird68-magnetic-switch-mechanical-keyboard-kit](https://clickclack.io/products/click-clack-x-kochi-hummingbird68-magnetic-switch-mechanical-keyboard-kit)\n\nStock the quality is shocking for the price, the case is well made, feels decent, sounds okay if a bit loud for my tastes, keycaps are solid, ect. The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "A quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

    "selftext": "[https://x.com/Guilty\\_Gamer\\_X/status/1980302295247257922](https://x.com/Guilty_Gamer_X/status/1980302295247257922)  \n\\#keebaweek continues, this is week 5. This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

Is there any reliable monitor (Dell, LG, BenQ) that combines HDMI 2.1 and a functional PD (30W+) that drops below $600 or $650 on sale?\nThanks for the help!\n\nTL;DR: Searching for a 27-32\" 2K/4K flat monitor under $600. It needs both HDMI 2.1 (for gaming) and functional USB-C PD >18W (to charge my iPad Pro). The models I've found either fail on PD (MSI OLED) or have major QC risks (INNOCN).

    "selftext": "So my fault I didn't do my homework and purchased a monitor that has USB-C but not video or PD. I have 2 computers 1) my gaming PC that is hooked directly to the monitor via DP 2) my work laptop that I thought I could hook up directly via USB C for display and PD. Finally, I have a USB hub/switch I use where my mouse/keyboard/web cam is plugged into.\n\nSo my question is, is there anyway I can have a 2 cable solution where the PC is plugged into one input (DP) on the monitor and the work laptop is plugged into another?

FPS\n\n-Preffered refresh rate would be 240 - 280 but 180 should also be fine\n\n-My room dosent get too bright at daytime, so no preference between glossy or coated \n\n-Wouldnt want to spend extra on higher screen size/ultrawide\n\nThe only things im worried about on OLED are brightness, text clarity and VRR flicker (which also effects the mini-led), i've read that QD-OLED usually has better text clarity than WOLED, but its supposed to be improved on with the mo27g28g aswell as brightness.\nUnfamilliar with OLED care features and which one has the better ones.\n\n\nAs for the mini-led, its obviously alot cheaper but also has its fair share of downsides (and upsides) like bad VRR flicker, possibly blacksmearing, lower local dimmingzones than some newer Aoc mini-leds (that arent available in europe i think) and lastly slower response/higher input latency (not a comp. Fps player idk if i should care). Also have heard that they can get quite hot which would be concerning since i usually play for long-ish periods at a time, dont know if thats an OLED problem aswell.\n\nNo knowledge/experience with HDR and HDR ratings, for example the aoc q27g3xmn has a HDR1000 rating vs the mo27g28g with a HDR500 rating, whats the difference? Does it matter alot?\n\n\nWill be building my new pc in the next 1-2 months incase there are any upcoming monitors that come out later this year that i should keep an eye on im open to any suggestions.\n\n\nWould love to hear from people that have one of these models and/or can compare OLED and mini-led from their own experience.\n\nThank you.",

This is a deal breaker for me as I like to recline on my chair and won't always be looking head on.\n\nI will be using the monitor mainly for slow paced simulation games and general productivity, which is why I would genuinely consider the MP275Q even though it's got much lower specs.\n\nPeople with experience with either of these 2 monitors please give me any input.\n\nThank you",

Because the blur on my two 1440p monitors make them pretty much useless I just default to 100% on all three which causes eye strain when I use the main 4K monitor. \n\nSeriously, this has been an issue on windows for decades, and it's still a problem, and the fact that Office applications are the most affected by blur just further proves that Microsoft just can't handle scaling at all (don't get me started on the grandma-level \"recommended\" scaling factors...).   \nI currently run Win11. \n\nIs there any plugin or third party software that could fix the sclaing issues?

It fit what I wanted 2.5 years ago but with me getting more and more competitive in CS I feel like it’s not cutting it anymore, just to wide of viewing angles it claims to have a 1ms response time. \n\nI have seen some stuff from Zowie that’s interesting but $500 for a 1080p 280hz TN panel seems steep. I also don’t trust all the marketing lingo reminds me of Alienware too much, and those are just expensive versions of other products. \n\nAnyone have any recommendations? Not sure if OLEDs are very fast just know they are very expensive. I have a budget around $500-$600USD. ",

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters.

[P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

I know some people might say to go for a 1440p monitor with my specs, but I’m gonna be playing games like Fortnite, FC26, GTA 5, Minecraft, Rocket League. Mostly Fortnite, where I care most about my FPS. Unless I can get around 240fps on 1440p with this setup, then I’m probably gonna go with 1080p. I’ve narrowed it down to these 2 monitors, but can’t pick which is better. Asus one is $130, and KTC is $140. Which is better? Thanks",

It’s technically better on paper, especially for competitive gaming.\n\t•\tLG UltraGear 27GS75Q-B has slightly lower input lag, minimal ghosting, and smoother motion in fast-paced games. It might feel more “fluid” in real-world gameplay.\n\nBoth support HDR10 and adaptive sync (G-SYNC/FreeSync).\n\nI’ve attached a picture of both monitors for reference.

Devo dire che i lampi che vedete dalla gif non li aveva mai fatti, ma dopo un po’ si fermano e rimangono solo le righe. \n\nQuindi mi chiedo, sta peggiorando il monitor oppure è possibile (sperando di no) che si tratti della GPU?\n\nSpero di aver postato nella sezione giusta",

Powered by advanced Mini-LED technology, these monitors deliver vivid, high-contrast visuals, making them especially ideal for HDR content and immersive gaming experiences.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1jd5uocdwf1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37badcde8916b5a54460b9258f6571ba2dcf5c7\n\n**Mini-LED Backlight with 1152 Local Dimming Zones**\n\nAll three models are equipped with 1,152 full-array local dimming zones, deliver peak brightness of up to 1000 nits, and are VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified for a premium HDR experience with stunning clarity and contrast.\n\nCompared with conventional LCD monitors, the Mini-LED backlight technology provides a reduced halo effect, deeper blacks without being grayish, delivering precise light control and more lifelike, vivid visuals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvkqby5tcdwf1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a175ffc0d2ea17ad8c4faeeb8319e6711f5243\n\n**Quantum Dot Film for Superior Visuals**\n\nThe MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Rapid IPS panels, while the MAG 274QPF X30MV adopts a Rapid VA panel. All of them integrate Quantum Dot film to deliver an exceptional visual and gaming experience.\n\n\\- Rapid IPS / Rapid VA ensure ultra-fast response times, minimizing motion blur and delivering smooth gameplay.\n\n\\- Quantum Dot film expands the color gamut, producing richer, more vibrant colors for stunning image quality.\n\nTogether, they offer a perfect blend of speed, clarity, and color accuracy for both gamers and content creators.\n\n\n\n**Revolutionary Dual Mode for Ultimate Flexibility**\n\nBoth MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Dual Mode, supporting:\n\n·        4K@160Hz for ultra-sharp visuals.\n\n·        FHD@320Hz for ultra-smooth gameplay. \n\nTo make switching effortless, gamers can seamlessly move between AAA titles and competitive FPS games using MSI’s 5-way Navi Key, which allows them to toggle between two modes with a single click.\n\nMSI has also made Dual Mode smarter with AI Dual Mode. This feature detects resolution and refresh rate settings and automatically adjusts to the optimized refresh rate when switching. For example, if you set your monitor to 4K@120Hz, the FHD mode will automatically adjust to 240Hz instead of 320Hz, ensuring a balanced experience without extreme discrepancies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss8zsxuycdwf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3d7faf4171a7e6a1c0c02368dfb61ba6a323d5\n\nLearn more about Dual Mode and other AI features, please visit:\n\n[https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience](https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience)\n\n **Specification:**\n\n|Model|MPG 274URDFW E16M|MAG 274UPDF E16M|MAG 274QPF X30MV|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Size|27\"|27\"|27\"|\n|Resolution|UHD|UHD|WQHD|\n|Resfresh Rate|160Hz|160Hz|300Hz|\n|Dual Mode|FHD 320Hz|FHD 320Hz|N/A|\n|Panel|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid VA with Mini-LED|\n|Local Dimming|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|\n|Quantum Dot|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Brightness (nits)|SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |\n|HDR|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|\n|Response Time|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|\n|Connectivity|1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/98W PD, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x USB 2.0 Type-B |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/15W PD |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (WQHD@300Hz)|\n|Gaming Intelligence App|Support|N/A|N/A|\n|Firmware Update|Support|Support|Support|\n\nFor more information please visit the product pages.\n\nMPG 274URDFW E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274UPDF E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274QPF X30MV: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/)\n\n  \nRelease Date:\n\nThey are now available on the market in US.",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

After 4–5 years of use, the battery isn’t as strong, and I’ve had to replace the pads twice. The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

That being said, the design wasn’t my favorite. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack location felt awkward, the rotation limiter that attaches on the side felt like an afterthought, and the driver cap, although unique, looked a little weird. \n\nTaking some not-so-subtle design cues from the Dahlia and Tungsten, this was my attempt to solve all those aesthetic issues. Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

    "selftext": "I'm potentially in the market for my first pair of earbuds and I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could help with. I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "selftext": "So I started this hobby in 2021 with hd599se. In that time I've tried and owned probably 80 headphones everything from he1kse to thieaudio ghost. Start of 2025 I pressed reset on my 14 pair collection. I was wearing maybe 5 pairs monthly and all the others were just collecting dust. So I got rid of them all. \n\nI wanted to rediscover how it felt to enter the hobby once again this time knowing what I like and how I've changed. I also wanted to explore all of these OG brands that have all these prestige having been a chifi guy.\n\nI picked each of these up £50 from eBay. K550 and ad500x. Sitting down EQ, pads and cable mod. It has been so much more fun and satisfying. I feel like I helped make them show their soul. They also sound great. ",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

But when I use that button to open the menu (inventory, skill tree progress, map, ect,) - about 80% of the time, all the buttons go dead and I can’t navigate the menu, or even exit out. So then I have to hit the ‘steam button’, then close, at which point all the buttons in the menu work suddenly and I can navigate navigate the menu.\n\nHaving to do this constantly is super annoying.

    "selftext": "Issue: Battery stuck at 0 and isnt charging at all. Unplugging just shuts down the deck (LCD) immediately so I can’t recalibrate thru letting it die in BIOS.\n\nHad to replace the og battery because it was already in its “spicy” phase. Ordered a Getac one and replaced it. \n\nThings I’ve done: \n1. Upon removing the og battery, I tried running the deck thru the charger. Charger plugged, no battery. Tested some light games Ni No Kuni 2 and some Emulation with Unicorn Overlord. With the charger plugged, it would power down especially when game gets heavy or theres too much going on. This happened around 5-10 times. Then I limited the TDP to 10 and the shut downs stopped. (Again this is with charger plugged ONLY and no battery) \n\n2. When I received the new battery, immediately hooked it up and booted the deck. 37% and CHARGING but the battery had a “h? m?” So i figured I needed to calibrate it. Had it drained fully but then it never came up again. I think I messed up by letting it drain down to 0.\n\n3. Tried removing the battery pin, let it sit a while and reconnect it. \n\n4. Tried leaving it on charge both ON and OFF on separate days and even charged it while pn desktop mode. \n\n5. Followed the battery storage mode instructions and even the “minus volume button + “…” + “Power”. Basically almost all the previous posts in the thread. ;(\n\n6. Tried different chargers, both 65w and lower.  \n-used the og charger eversince. Og Charger can charge other devices without issues soI doubt its the problem. \n\nQuestions: \n1. Idk if 5.90 V (2nd pic) is normal but from what I’ve seen from other screenshots, it seems the voltage is too low? Is this normal? \n\n2. Is there a tool/device that electronic repair shops could tell which has an issue? Like can they check if my type c port is faulty or is it the battery?\n\nCan't reach out to Valve for repair since I'm in SEAsia and the deck (LCD) was bought in 2023.",

    "selftext": "My friend's deck battery health got down to 30 ish percent and his oem charger broke. He bought some offbrand charger in the meantime and eventually the deck just stopped turning on altogether as well as stopped receiving a charge. After a month or 2 of the deck sitting like this we bought it an ifixit oem battery replacement and I had him swap the inflated battery for the new one. I'm unsure if it's his offbrand charger to blame or if it's a mix of the charger and the low battery health but even after the battery swap the deck will not turn on or take a charge. Is there anything you guys know for a fix? we've tried booting into the bios, into the 3 dot menu where you pick older steam os versions, as well as booting into the recovery mode, and tried holding the power button for 30 seconds and we tried letting it just charge for a bit. Still just nothing. I'll include a link to said charger below.\n\n[https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Xtreme-3-Charge-4-Charge-5-Flip-5-Flip-6-Clip-4-JBL-Go-3-Portable-Dustproof-Waterproof-Bluetooth-Speaker-65W-USB-C-Adapter-Charger-Power-Supply-C/2164720571?classType=REGULAR&from=/search](https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Xtreme-3-Charge-4-Charge-5-Flip-5-Flip-6-Clip-4-JBL-Go-3-Portable-Dustproof-Waterproof-Bluetooth-Speaker-65W-USB-C-Adapter-Charger-Power-Supply-C/2164720571?classType=REGULAR&from=/search)",

It won’t open.\n* Nexus and GameBanana installers mention needing the loader and Reloaded but give Windows instructions only.\n\n**Where I’m stuck:**\n\n* How to properly run Reloaded in my SD\n* How to use DSTS mod loader with Reloaded\n* How and where to place mod files so the game launches with mods on Deck.\n\nSo yeah, if anyone knows about / can provide a step-by-step checklist that I can run on the Deck (exact protontricks commands, where to drop files in the prefix, how to set Steam launch options, how to confirm Reloaded is loaded) with screenshots or exact file paths, I would greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale.

I was so happy, but the interface was so slow and 5 minutes later it shut down and returned to no image/haptics and fans on. \n\nSo, does anyone know what could I do?, I live in MX so there is no option for an RMA, and so far I have tried:\n\nBattery storage mode. \n\nManual Battery storage mode (Vol up + three dots + power) \n\nAccessing Bios (because of no image, this doesn't work) \n\nDraining battery to 0 and then charging with official charger (nothing, but now with new battery maybe something might change?\n\nThe only thing that worked was physically disconnecting the battery l, but I'm a bit hesitant to open the deck so soon after just doing so. \n\nAnyone can help? Thank you",

Setup Artemis (Moonlight port) test the connection to make sure that it works. \n\nThen on the other screens make sure you can run Artemis on it (Android set top box or projector will be fine) Doesn't have to be powerful. \n\n\nI've tried it on a Pi but it lagged too much. 😭\n\nRun Artemis put in your Steam Decks IP and it  should appear. \n\nOnce that is running. Connect your Sonos up via Bluetooth. Then change the audio output to your speaker. Its automatically set to Sync Sunshine. \n\nThen go into the settings of the SONOS app, select all the speakers and it should play through all the speakers. ",

    "selftext": "The other day, I decided to get a 512GB microSD card for my Steam Deck, to put a bunch of my smaller games on. That way I'd have more room for larger games on the internal SSD.\n\nI went into Settings > Storage, formatted the microSD card, then used the \"move content\" option on some smaller games, including LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4. The whole point was to make room for some larger games, and since I was using SteamOS' built-in tool to move the games I figured I'd be safe to do this. So at the time, it seemed like a better idea than installing the larger games onto the microSD card.\n\nWhen I decided to play LEGO Harry Potter today, I noticed that the game was fully reset. I got thrown into the initial cutscene again, and instead of being in year 2, I now get the message that I have no save files.\n\nIs there any way to recover the save files, or do I have to start all the way from the beginning again?\n\nUPDATE: I've been trying to troubleshoot based on info I found in a Reddit thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/p64sxcj0ra). In Home/.local/share/Steam/userdata I can't find any directory with the game ID for LEGO Harry Potter (21130?), under Home/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/21130 I only find files that were created or modified today, no older files, so my save data isn't in there either.",

    "selftext": "Kind of a noob question, but I'm curious of the quality of Remote Play over a local network as well as with resolution output.  \n\nFor context, I used to have my PC and TV in the same room and used my 4k tv as a second monitor which I would play games on via Big Picture Mode.  I recently moved and now my TV is in the living room and PC is in the office.  I kind of got used to playing my PC on my couch and find it hard to go back to the computer desk for a lot of games.\n\nI was thinking of moving my PC to my living room but then I would lose the desktop setup for other games (FPS etc)  I saw that the Steam Deck has a dock which connects to HDMI which might be the solution I'm looking for.  While I like the portability of the Deck, I'm wondering if I can just use it as an access point to my PC and connect it to the TV while using controller or mouse and keyboard to game from my living room (basically using it as a replacement for Big Picture Mode). \n\nWould the Steam Deck be worth the price if I mainly use it docked to stream my PC to my TV?  I'm afraid of the latency while playing over a wifi network as well as upscaling the resolution to 1440 or 4k.  I feel like this would be a considerable downgrade from using the TV as a monitor but maybe I'm wrong?  Does anyone else use their Deck this way?\n\nThanks!",

I got it yesterday as part of my job (I'm a developper). While I started setting it up, I had really hard time getting passed the wifi connection. Each time I was trying to connect, it failed and after a single attempt, the driver was seemingly borked as it stopped seeing every networks after that attempt. I needed each time to hard reset the console with the '...' option while rebooting.\n\nUntil I had the idea that my SSID (wifi name) was the culprit. Apparently, the Deck doesn't like at all having apostrophes in the SSID, it seemingly borks the driver, so avoid stuff like \"C'pas d'tes affaires\", which in french means \"It's none of your buisiness\".\n\nApart from that, holy cow, it's insane to play WoW Classic on this device with the Console Port Addon... <3\n\nCheers!",

    "selftext": "I know this sort of thing is talked about a lot. But I cannot wrap my head around a lot of the nuances of this. First, just the setup is confusing. I want to use this straight out of the ES-DE frontend and I'm seeing conflicting info on the narrative, ie. \"Here's how to do it,\" vs. \"Simply use the flatpak/native version, through EmuDeck is shitty.\" I'll do whatever allows for the most optimal, user-friendly and robust selection. \n\nThe first thing I think I want to be armed with is the knowledge of what roms require accompanying files (chd and the like), because from what I've seen for most depositories, it makes it seem like all of these require a heck of a lot of files to run (audio and whatnot) so if there's a simplified version of a tutorial out there to help familiarize with this and understand which games require what and what kinds need to be split, etc. that would be very helpful.\n\nI followed this guide (https://youtu.be/HY7eUwhC9g8?si=cYE-8mGnaANxlotn) up to the point where he uses Steam Rom Manager but realized first off that this must be an older version because mine doesn't look like that and that I don't have all these options, and second that only the \"MAME 2003\" option comes up in the parser and since I don't have any of the other MAME options in the tutorial pop up, I'm kind of at a loss of where to go from here. Also, this guide makes it sound like the only real way to get every game working without a hitch is to go straight through Steam Rom Manager. Is that really true? If so I accept it but that's definitely not appealing. Mostly I need to figure out how to get all the different versions of MAME I apparently need to run everything, and through EmuDeck it doesn't seem like I have the option like the guy who did this tutorial did and that has me scratching my head.\n\nThe following guide (https://youtu.be/bCGvC-p7-Sk?si=K8xlLHwFWSr_EU-k) helped me understand some of what to do after getting it working to configure it but I obviously haven't gotten that far yet and want to know if this will be sufficient enough for configuring it on the deck.\n\nLastly, I'm mainly looking to play 90's era fighters and side scrollers like KI, MK and Street Fighter) compared to the older stuff from the 80's. Are there romsets available for stuff like this? That seems like another complex thing and the tutorial seemed to focus on individual roms so that's another point of confusion for me.\n\n\nI know this is a lot. Thanks for any and all help.",

Super crisp and fluid. But.... it has some stuttering and hiccups. I eventually reduced it to 120 Hz and it seemed more stable.\n\nFor those of you that use the Deck in a dock, as a desktop, what was the sweet spot for you in terms of resolution and refresh rate, for it to behave nicely?\n\nEDIT: not going to try and play at 1440p, guys, just to use it as desktop for browsing, office work, etc.",

I wanted to say thank you to everyone who congratulated me in my previous post, it was very nice. \n\nTo be clear, this game is free, it has no additional costs, no paid DLC, no commercials, nothing. I simply wanted to make this game and now I hope people are willing to play it because there went a lot of work into making it. I rather see 100 players instead of 10 paid players. \n\nI started making this back in 2012, so basically it was more than 10 years in development. But I made it while I was studying and working.

Unplugging just shuts down the deck (LCD) immediately so I can’t recalibrate thru letting it die in BIOS.\n\nHad to replace the og battery because it was already in its “spicy” phase. Ordered a Getac one and replaced it. \n\nThings I’ve done: \n1. Upon removing the og battery, I tried running the deck thru the charger. Charger plugged, no battery. Tested some light games Ni No Kuni 2 and some Emulation with Unicorn Overlord. With the charger plugged, it would power down especially when game gets heavy or theres too much going on. This happened around 5-10 times. Then I limited the TDP to 10 and the shut downs stopped. (Again this is with charger plugged ONLY and no battery) \n\n2. When I received the new battery, immediately hooked it up and booted the deck. 37% and CHARGING but the battery had a “h? m?” So i figured I needed to calibrate it. Had it drained fully but then it never came up again. I think I messed up by letting it drain down to 0.\n\n3. Tried removing the battery pin, let it sit a while and reconnect it. \n\n4. Tried leaving it on charge both ON and OFF on separate days and even charged it while pn desktop mode. \n\n5. Followed the battery storage mode instructions and even the “minus volume button + “…” + “Power”. Basically almost all the previous posts in the thread. ;(\n\n6. Tried different chargers, both 65w and lower.  \n-used the og charger eversince. Og Charger can charge other devices without issues soI doubt its the problem. \n\nQuestions: \n1. Idk if 5.90 V (2nd pic) is normal but from what I’ve seen from other screenshots, it seems the voltage is too low? Is this normal? \n\n2. Is there a tool/device that electronic repair shops could tell which has an issue? Like can they check if my type c port is faulty or is it the battery?\n\nCan't reach out to Valve for repair since I'm in SEAsia and the deck (LCD) was bought in 2023.",

I recently moved and now my TV is in the living room and PC is in the office.  I kind of got used to playing my PC on my couch and find it hard to go back to the computer desk for a lot of games.\n\nI was thinking of moving my PC to my living room but then I would lose the desktop setup for other games (FPS etc)  I saw that the Steam Deck has a dock which connects to HDMI which might be the solution I'm looking for.  While I like the portability of the Deck, I'm wondering if I can just use it as an access point to my PC and connect it to the TV while using controller or mouse and keyboard to game from my living room (basically using it as a replacement for Big Picture Mode). \n\nWould the Steam Deck be worth the price if I mainly use it docked to stream my PC to my TV?  I'm afraid of the latency while playing over a wifi network as well as upscaling the resolution to 1440 or 4k.  I feel like this would be a considerable downgrade from using the TV as a monitor but maybe I'm wrong?  Does anyone else use their Deck this way?\n\nThanks!",

The audio will be in sync for all the displays (tried 5 so far.) \n\nFirst install Decky on your Steam Deck. \nThe link is below. \n\nhttps://decky.xyz/\n\nThen install the Sunshine Plugin. \nYou'll have to go into desktop mode to install Sunshine first before being able to use the Decky Plugin. \n\nWith that done. Setup Artemis (Moonlight port) test the connection to make sure that it works. \n\nThen on the other screens make sure you can run Artemis on it (Android set top box or projector will be fine) Doesn't have to be powerful. \n\n\nI've tried it on a Pi but it lagged too much. 😭\n\nRun Artemis put in your Steam Decks IP and it  should appear. \n\nOnce that is running. Connect your Sonos up via Bluetooth. Then change the audio output to your speaker. Its automatically set to Sync Sunshine. \n\nThen go into the settings of the SONOS app, select all the speakers and it should play through all the speakers. ",

But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale. Added a Ugreen dock and USB-C switch (like the old-days KVM interfaces) for my mouse and keyboard (to be shared between my 8 year old Windows laptop and the new Steam Deck \"desktop\".\n\nI set the external display as primary and set it to 1440p 144 Hz. Super crisp and fluid. But.... it has some stuttering and hiccups. I eventually reduced it to 120 Hz and it seemed more stable.\n\nFor those of you that use the Deck in a dock, as a desktop, what was the sweet spot for you in terms of resolution and refresh rate, for it to behave nicely?\n\nEDIT: not going to try and play at 1440p, guys, just to use it as desktop for browsing, office work, etc.",

Unplugging just shuts down the deck (LCD) immediately so I can’t recalibrate thru letting it die in BIOS.\n\nHad to replace the og battery because it was already in its “spicy” phase. Ordered a Getac one and replaced it. \n\nThings I’ve done: \n1. Upon removing the og battery, I tried running the deck thru the charger. Charger plugged, no battery. Tested some light games Ni No Kuni 2 and some Emulation with Unicorn Overlord. With the charger plugged, it would power down especially when game gets heavy or theres too much going on. This happened around 5-10 times. Then I limited the TDP to 10 and the shut downs stopped. (Again this is with charger plugged ONLY and no battery) \n\n2. When I received the new battery, immediately hooked it up and booted the deck. 37% and CHARGING but the battery had a “h? m?” So i figured I needed to calibrate it. Had it drained fully but then it never came up again. I think I messed up by letting it drain down to 0.\n\n3. Tried removing the battery pin, let it sit a while and reconnect it. \n\n4. Tried leaving it on charge both ON and OFF on separate days and even charged it while pn desktop mode. \n\n5. Followed the battery storage mode instructions and even the “minus volume button + “…” + “Power”. Basically almost all the previous posts in the thread. ;(\n\n6. Tried different chargers, both 65w and lower.  \n-used the og charger eversince. Og Charger can charge other devices without issues soI doubt its the problem. \n\nQuestions: \n1. Idk if 5.90 V (2nd pic) is normal but from what I’ve seen from other screenshots, it seems the voltage is too low? Is this normal? \n\n2. Is there a tool/device that electronic repair shops could tell which has an issue? Like can they check if my type c port is faulty or is it the battery?\n\nCan't reach out to Valve for repair since I'm in SEAsia and the deck (LCD) was bought in 2023.",

    "selftext": "Kind of a noob question, but I'm curious of the quality of Remote Play over a local network as well as with resolution output.  \n\nFor context, I used to have my PC and TV in the same room and used my 4k tv as a second monitor which I would play games on via Big Picture Mode.  I recently moved and now my TV is in the living room and PC is in the office.  I kind of got used to playing my PC on my couch and find it hard to go back to the computer desk for a lot of games.\n\nI was thinking of moving my PC to my living room but then I would lose the desktop setup for other games (FPS etc)  I saw that the Steam Deck has a dock which connects to HDMI which might be the solution I'm looking for.  While I like the portability of the Deck, I'm wondering if I can just use it as an access point to my PC and connect it to the TV while using controller or mouse and keyboard to game from my living room (basically using it as a replacement for Big Picture Mode). \n\nWould the Steam Deck be worth the price if I mainly use it docked to stream my PC to my TV?  I'm afraid of the latency while playing over a wifi network as well as upscaling the resolution to 1440 or 4k.  I feel like this would be a considerable downgrade from using the TV as a monitor but maybe I'm wrong?  Does anyone else use their Deck this way?\n\nThanks!",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home.

Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I read online that I need to consider the total wattage that the dimmer will support (e.g. if  I have two strings connected together I would need a dimmer that can support: 60 bulbs x 7 watts each bulb= total 420 watts) and that it's compatible with the listed 31 voltage, right?

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar?

One such thing is outside lighting, which currently runs on a dusk/dawn schedule controlled by a light switch that is z-wave.\n\nSo, I want to swap that switch for something in the decora form-factor that has an astronomical timer that continuously adjusts the daily schedule for dusk/dawn.  This is how I did it years ago (lived in this house for 18 years) before I had a hub and devices, but I was always annoyed that eventually the internal battery would die and the clock and schedule would get messed up after a power outage.\n\nI'm looking for a similar device that has WiFi capability, only really needed for the purpose of setting the clock from an NTP server after power outage.  Otherwise, I would prefer the device not depend on the cloud for scheduling, etc...\n\nAny suggestions?",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two). I will not buy another Utec and when I searched the group that's what people recommended.  \nWe are looking for a deadbolt replacement lock (no handle / knob needed) that has fingerprint and bluetooth (no wifi).

I'm trying to come up with a way to use a bluetooth (not wifi) thermometer/hygrometer and connect it to a pc (windows). I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

The new house is a chalet built in 1910 reformed in 2021.  The walls are thick and the two story chalet is narrow and deep.  I am planning on using Amazon’s eero 6E Pro mesh network with Zigbee to give good coverage.\n\nI have an Apple TV and want to be able to see who is at the door.  In the past I tried to do this with Amazon Ring doorbell camera and Fire TV.  By the time I could see the door video on the TV I could have gotten up and answered the door, twice… three times!  In short, it was so slow as to be useless.  Hopefully, HomeKit can do better.\n\nI am considering getting Homey or Home Assistant - I don’t know if that would help with speed.  It would be okay if the camera is separate from the doorbell.  I just want it to connect fast enough to be useful.  I am open to anything that solves this problem.  Moving in December so there is time to shop Black Friday sales and even change the mesh devices or other devices.",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

    "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking to add some automation to my home for the very first time. I am looking to start by purchasing a smart lock for my front door. I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Help identifying Danfoss radiator valve types + correct adapters for tado X (Denmark, district heating)",
    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

    "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking to add some automation to my home for the very first time. I am looking to start by purchasing a smart lock for my front door. I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "Christmas post… thinking about it already! I’m looking for a compact smart plug that sits between an outlet and a device. When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue.

I currently have it on a smart outlet thats on/off on a schedule. I would like to find a smart outlet that will dim on/off the lights over the course of anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. I dont really care what the time increment is. I just wanna be able to set it to dim on at x time and dim off at x time. I have cruised youtube and the google and have not found what I'm lookin for yet, i dont think. So i figured id come to the ole reddit and see if what I'm looking for even exists and if anyone has specific products they would suggest. ",

    "title": "Bosch Air 2000i WiFi question",
    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

A switch like that would have to have a very specific \"on\" time. Like, I should be able to tell it how long it takes to extend fully and program that time in seconds.\n\n  \nIs there any product that works well and integrates with the typical smart home hubs that would work?

What I'd like to avoid is another Wi-Fi-based switch with a proprietary app. I am pretty handy, but a plug-and-play switch is really all I'm willing to invest in for this project.",

At times, I even get the message “Unable to load Favourites,” although they were initially visible.\n* No error messages, no logs, no response from Amazon.\n* After switching to a different Alexa account, the same issues reappear after a while.\n\nI suspect a cloud-side issue, since the behavior is identical across multiple devices and persists even after reinstalling the app. Other users have reported similar bugs — some going back weeks.\n\nAnd this is still the “old” Alexa — what’s coming our way with Alexa+?\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n* Has anyone experienced the same?\n* Are there any workarounds (e.g., via the web interface or voice commands)?\n* Has anyone tried bypassing the Alexa app entirely by creating a new, empty Alexa account and using Echo devices just as microphones/speakers for Home Assistant?\n* Has anyone received a meaningful response from Amazon support?",

    "selftext": "Is or has anyone else thought about doing this? Has anyone done it successfully? \n\nI'd like parts of my home to have lights turn on ONLY when there is a person detected. Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hey all. Fishing around for some affordable recommendations.\n\n1. I was using Sengled bulbs in my room and suddenly the app logged me out. I saw that the company shut down or something like that. I have zero interest in any complicated set ups to make it work again so I'm looking to replace them. What are some good budget replacements? Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. ㅤNeed 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS. If there's a better community for me to ask these things, feel free to scold me and send me on my way.",

    "selftext": "I have a Nest thermostat in my apartment building- and have the “Auto-Schedule” feature on.\n\nPer the app description, “Auto-Schedule learns your behavior as you adjust your thermostat and automatically creates a schedule to match your heating and cooling preferences.”\n\nHowever, my Nest does not seem to be adjusting properly. I like to sleep with the temperature around 74-75, but during the day I keep it a few degrees warmer, closer to 77. Every single night I have to change the thermostat manually to be set around 75, and then I have to do the same thing every morning. It has been months and I am starting to get frustrated. Last night the temperature adjusted from 75 to 77 while I was sleeping and I woke up in the middle of the night. That would be the opposite scheduling of what I want, and I’m starting to get incredibly frustrated.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar issues, and how could I correct it?",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

It's a house with its own Boiler and heated through Fernwärme (sorry, not sure the proper English term for this, maybe district heating?).\n\nAnyways, my plan is not touch the boiler itself, but the thermostats in each room, so I can control them automatically through my phone or have automations on Home Assistant.\nAttached is a picture of the current thermostat I have in each room.\n\nWould you have some experience with a similar setup? What could work here?\n\nThanks in advance ",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

It’s all been working fine through Home Assistant and Apple Home, but I’m starting to feel the mess of having multiple bridges and protocols.\n\nSo now I’m trying to go “Matter-only” as much as possible. My next step is replacing the IKEA Zigbee shades. I came across Bringnox blinds that natively support Matter and connect directly to Apple Home without a bridge, which sounds like a good fit for where I’m headed.\n\nHas anyone here gone through a similar migration — especially with shades or blinds? Any tips on what works smoothly under Matter right now?",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking to add some automation to my home for the very first time. I am looking to start by purchasing a smart lock for my front door. I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I'm currently using [https://www.simplehuman.com/products/under-counter-can-pull-out-35l-dual-compartment?variant=30245381111939](https://www.simplehuman.com/products/under-counter-can-pull-out-35l-dual-compartment?variant=30245381111939) which has been fine, but I just started the smart home journey and it's one of the first things I wanted to upgrade since it gets used very often. The added features I'm looking for are\n\n1) Pullout function to open automatically either with sensor or with opening the cabinet (ideally the former)  \n2) Touchless trash can lid  \n3) No drilling into cabinet required preferred\n\nThank you all in advance for any recommendations!

    "selftext": "I have a large system that is a collection random smarthome products. I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

No User.000, no duplicates.\n\nIn net user and PowerShell (Get-LocalUser), there’s just one local account — mine.\n\nRegistry under ProfileList only points to C:\\Users\\User.\n\nNo extra Microsoft accounts in “Email & accounts.”\n\n\nBasically, Windows insists there’s a second me, but refuses to show any proof of its existence.\n\nThings I’ve already tried (with no luck):\n\nnetplwiz auto-login settings\n\nDeleting cached logins in Credential Manager\n\nRemoving Windows Hello & Web Sign-in registry entries\n\nChecking for duplicate SIDs in the registry\n\nResetting LastLoggedOnUser\n\nPurging IdentityCache folders\n\nPerforming minor ritual sacrifices (didn’t help either)\n\n\nNow, as a bonus feature, the sign-in options screen says:\n\n “Some of these settings are managed by your organization.”\n…which is funny, because I am the organization.\n\n\n\nAt this point I’m not sure if Windows created a shadow account, or if my PC just got lonely and decided to make a friend.\n\nI’m not a hardcore tech person, but I can handle regedit, PowerShell, and basic admin stuff, granted with some tutorial help - so if anyone has ideas on how to exorcise my ghost profile, I’d love to hear them.\n\nThanks in advance, and may your Windows updates break fewer things than mine",

    "selftext": "So basically since going to therapy I've come to the theory that my cell phone is part of the reason my social anxiety and my adhd symptoms have gotten so much worse in the last few years, so I suggested my therapist that I test this by buying either a flip phone or a landline and then locking my smart phone away for a month or so to see if that improves things. There's one big problem with this: my job requires me to use a specific app to clock in and out, and I don't really have any other way to do it when I'm at work. I don't really know anything about how technology works/changes but is there possibly some way I could program my phone to lock me out of all of its features EXCEPT for the app I use to clock in/out for work?",

    "selftext": "So recently ive moved, and since ive moved my wifi hasnt been acting the same, at my old place my wifi could stretch across the house through all of the walls (like 6 at most) and still be perfectly fine, no stuttering, no pausing to load videos, less than 60 ping at most times, but since moving, my new router with exactly the same plan cant even reach more than 25 feet down a straight hallway. I ran some wifi tests, and in the same room as the router, within five feet of it, my wifi speed was 705mbps download 585mbps upload, whereas in my gaming room, which is 25 feet at most, down a straight hallway with a singular right angled turn to get into my room, im getting 10mbps download and 21mbps upload. Even with a singular bar of cellular data im getting 90mbps download and 20 mbps upload. It affects every device, and is so bad that if i was watching a youtube video and opened battlefield, helldivers, or other similar games it just stops loading the youtube video. I also cannot be in a call without having at least 3000ms of ping (according to discord)\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? If it helps its an at&t wifi plan, and as far as im aware the walls are exclusively drywall, with the foundation being out of brick.",

    "selftext": "So, my laptop crashed earlier today. I'm not sure why; it happened while it was closed. I closed it and it was fine, brought it upstairs, opened it, and it had crashed. It was a bit of a weird crash, though. It didn't immediately wake up upon opening it. Hitting the power button didn't do anything. I opened and closed it a few times to no avail, and resorted to just holding down the power button for increasingly long periods until the keyboard finally lit up.\n\nIt's been acting weird since then. Once it booted back up, all three USB ports were no longer working. If I plug something into them, the add-on is aware it has been plugged in (USB mouse and keyboard both lit up, external drive started humming) but the laptop itself seemed unaware that anything had been plugged in (mouse and keyboard weren't doing anything, could not access external drive in the file finder). So things plugged into the USB ports are getting power, but that's it.\n\nAnd now the function keys aren't working properly. I'm using a Dell, so F1, F2, and F3 are mute, volume down, and volume up, but they no longer provide volume control. They are only doing their \"function\" jobs. Toggling function lock hasn't done anything.\n\nI'm using a Dell G15 5510 from 2021 that was recently updated to Windows 11. I ran Dell's diagnostics (quick and advanced versions) and they came back saying everything was working fine. Device manager isn't flagging any drivers. Laptop says it's up to date but that an update to Windows 11 version 25H2 is available. I updated the firmware while troubleshooting. It's been rebooted several times at this point. USB ports are still useless and function keys are still unhelpful.",

    "selftext": "So I very naively downloaded a malware disguised as an antivirus, and need help getting rid of the files it has downloaded to my laptop. (The software was TOTAL AV, if that helps) \n\nI gave this ware access to my laptop and then realised my mistake and spent two hours trying to reverse it. \n\nImpact of the malware: taking up my storage, pop up ads telling me to “click here to get rid of the virus totally infecting your computer right now!! Click here!!” when connected to wifi, and my fans going crazy.\n\n First I deleted the app, then I rebooted my laptop into safe mode (and updated it) and did a full offline Microsoft defender scan. Nothing showed up so I hopped on and started deleting all my temp files.\n\nWhen it said that a few couldn’t be deleted because they were currently running, I went over to task manager and tried to shut them down there only to be told “access denied.” I have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of these things. It’s three am and I’m sick of it, I’ve tried to change permissions on the tasks/files to no avail, security tab advanced settings are greyed out, and whenever I try to resolve this (for example, restoring TrustedInstaller as the owner) but every time I try something, it tells me that security change cannot be applied to the problem files because \"Failed to enumerate objects in the container.”\n\n \nI looked this up and tried to solve it but I just can’t seem to. Tl:dr I can’t own the files or tasks, and can’t apply new settings to them without the aforementioned error message. I’m new to tech but I’ve really tried all the troubleshoots I’ve come across in my research to no avail, and really need help. If elaboration is needed on any of the issues I’m facing I will gladly provide \n\n(And an additional question, if I delete windows 11 completely and reinstall, would that solve it? this is a really new laptop that I mostly use for the internet, with basically nothing on it, and if I lost what I have on it I wouldn’t really mind. I would rather it not come to this but I’m desperate, lol.)",

    "selftext": "Hello, \n\nI recently had to take my computer to a repair store because I had updated the BIOS and it reset all my settings and caused me to get locked out of the drive that had Windows installed on it. They were able to repair the computer and ended up installing Windows on the Samsung EVO NVMe 500gb ssd in my motherboard. The issue is that Windows was originally installed on another Samsung EVO 250gb ssd that I had before I got the NVMe drive. They didn't clear the original drive Windows was installed on since I really couldn't remember what was on my other drives and didn't want to lose anything nor pay for them to back it up for me. So my question is if reformatting the 250gb drive, which has the duplicate Windows files on it, will cause any issues? Windows is booting off the NVMe drive but I don't want to cause myself any more issues if I wipe the original drive and break something else. I took everything else that I want to keep off the drive so I am just concerned with deleting the duplicate Windows files. Thanks for the help!",

    "title": "How to Troubleshoot Occasionally Unresponsive Laptop",
    "selftext": "Hi all, my daughter has an HP Elitebook 840 G6 with 32 GB of RAM. It was previously lightly used in an office setting and is in very good condition. It was recently updated to Windows 11 Home and is only used with Microsoft Edge (Google Docs, Colab, and light browsing) and email. There is hardly anything else installed. \n\nIt runs very quiet and Core Temp shows it regularly operating at under 45 degrees. I tried Handbrake on it and it runs it no problem without crashing and just gets a little louder as the fan spins up. Overall it is working great.\n\nHowever twice this week, we have returned to the computer which was previously sleeping to find it unresponsive and with the fan spinning loudly and the bottom of the laptop very warm to the touch. It never responds until we finally hard press the power button and turn it off and back on again. \n\nA check through the event log hasn’t shown anything particularly noticeable. \n\nAny idea how I can further troubleshoot this? Windows is fully updated and the BIOS is on the latest version. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

After requesting the data and getting the email earlier today I started downloading all my photos and videos. \n\nThe issue is about 1/4 of them downloaded as zipped files which have a PNG along with either a JPEG or MP4. (The file names end with main and overlay so I'm thinking this has something to do with photos or videos that have a filter on them) when I try to open any of these a Windows security warning pops up saying \"Windows found that this file is potentially harmful to protect your computer, windows has blocked access to this file\" it will not let me extract or view the files. \n\nThe other part of the issue is with 1/3 of the files. They have no thumbnail and when trying to open them I get another Windows security pop up saying \"These files can't be opened. Your internet security settings prevented one or more files from being opened\" When I go into the properties, the file type is: \"File\" there is an option to unblock the file but even when doing that I don't have any apps to open \"File\" files \n\nSo far I have downloaded about 1,000 photos and videos all together and have 27,000 to go. If anyone can help me figure out why I can't open the JPEG/PNG/MP4 files I described, or tell me what the \"File\" file is I would be very grateful.\n\nFor some further information I am running Windows 11. I am downloading the files to an external hard drive. I am downloading using Google Chrome. I do not have any antivirus, just Windows defender and after looking at all the security settings (windows and chrome) I could not find anything about files downloaded from the internet\n\n",

So now I really need to try and get the data off of this\n\nI found conflicting info on if turning it on again after fully turning it off and disconnecting the power would help. I found one post from someone in a similar situation saying that let the PC detect the drive and boot, and they were then able to fix the issue from there, but another site said doing that could damage the drive further and lead to more data being lost (also saw recommendations to try clearing the CMOS but that also requires turning it on)\n\nSimilarly saw some people saying using an enclosure and trying to read it from another PC would be fine, and others saying it was risky and could even cause issues with the other system\n\nThere's also an additional issue on top of all this because the PC is built by PC Specialist and still within the three year warranty, and I was hoping I can get the data out in a way where I can then get them to fix it? (IDK how much that matters or what they can do in this situation though)\n\nBasically, would the least risky option be a) try turning the PC on again, b) take the M.2 drive out and try to read it using an enclosure on another computer, c) boot from installation media and use sfc /scannow, d) get outside tech help or e) something else I haven't thought of?

Checked BIOS settings – RAID mode confirmed as “On” and boot order correct. 2. Verified RAID array – Status is “Normal,” no degraded disks. 3. Booted from Windows 11 installation media and attempted: • Automatic Startup Repair • Command prompt boot recovery commands (bootrec /fixmbr, /fixboot, /scanos, /rebuildbcd) • chkdsk on the main RAID volume 4. Loaded Intel RST drivers (versions 14.8.16.1063 and 15.2) during repair – RAID volume recognized, but the system still fails to boot. 5. Checked both UEFI and Legacy BIOS modes – same error persists. 6. Attempted rebuilding EFI and BCD manually – no success.\n\nDespite these efforts, the machine continues to show the same “disk read error” immediately after POST.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance. Please let me know if you need any diagnostic logs or screenshots.\n\nRegards, Amer",

The last time I can confirm my headset worked was was during the beta weekend trial back in the summer time. But basically as soon as I launch the game, the audio becomes choppy and then the quality drops and its hissing/buzzing but at very low frequency. \n\nI checked a couple other games and this issue is the same a cross all of them. I need to go into device manager and remove the headset and microphone drivers, unplug and replug in my headset to get it working again. No issues with media playback, this only happens with games. \n\nSpecs\n- Sennheiser PC38x wired headset/mic \n- Amd 5800 cpu\n- Amd 6950xt gpu\n- Msi B450 Tomahawk motherboard\n- Corsair 32gb ram\n- Windows 11 home version 10.0.26200\n\nI checked event viewer to see if there was any reported driver crashes or anything and there was no system events at the time of the audio issues. Really not sure what to do. ",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have been having an issue with my 4090 recently that has stumped me. A few years ago, when I got the GPU, I ran some benchmarks, and my score was about average for my components. Recently, I cleaned out my water cooling loop and dusted off the fans as I noticed the CPU temp getting a little too high during gaming sessions. I wanted to double-check the performance of my GPU and CPU to see if it was back to its original state. To my surprise, my scores dropped quite a bit, and I cannot seem to figure out the cause. It looks like my CPU is down in score as well!\n\nI have checked forums and trobuleshooted for days, but nothing seems to work. I have done the following so far.\n\n1. Cleaned and drained loop (Temperatures seem fine and even better during testing)\n2. Updated Motherboard BIOS\n3. Made sure to select \"Gaming BIOS\" on the GPU\n4. MSI CPU Gaming Boost turned on in BIOS\n5. Resizable Bar turned on\n6. Viturzialtion off and not installed\n7. Single Monitor\n8. 2 sticks of RAM vs 4 sticks (no difference)\n9. Overclocking (you can see the lower recent score has a higher clock speed for both CPU and GPU)\n10. G-Sync off\n11. Afterburner and Rivatuner off\n12. Memory passed Memtest86+\n13. Positive reinforcement\n14. Purchased Etsy Witch Spell\n\nIf anyone can give me some more suggestions, I would really appreciate it!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LMQepO6",

    "selftext": "For context, I have been trying to get BF6 without crashing. I read that for some people, updating their BIOS was the fix, in which case I did. I have a Gigabyte B560 Motherboard, with an I5-11400f and a 3060 TI. I had to turn XMP, Secure Boot, and TMP back on since it reset everything. It worked for two games, and I had to go back messing with settings and such. I decided to turn off my XMP profile to see if that would help, as it had also worked for other people. Well, when I disabled it, I got a message saying that Windows did not boot. So I turned XMP back on, and it has been working fine. I looked through my Event Viewer and found a new error stating \"Fatal Hardware error\". It appears every time I boot the system. So I am wondering if it is a false positive, or if either the RAM or the CPU is causing the issue. The PC has been slow to boot since updating the BIOS, but I don't know what else to do. Do I leave it as is since it is running fine, or do I keep messing with it? I have additional RAM sticks to try, and I also heard clearing CMOS could be a fix, but I figured to ask here before I do anything. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.",

    "title": "Is my only option to factory reset my computer (MacBook pro)?",
    "selftext": "\nSo here is what happened: I recieved an e-commerce newsletter from a furniture website. Annoyed, because I believed I had already unsubscribed a while ago, I quickly scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the unsubscribe button. It took me to a website with just a white background with the text “successfully unsubscribed” and some other smaller info. I then went back to the email to delete it when I noticed the e-mail address. Instead of being the official website URL (for example: furnituredepot@furnituredepot.com) there was an extra letter: furnituredepot@e.furnituredepot.com.  This immediately set off alarms for me. I downloaded AVAST in a hurry to detect and delete any malware. It found nothing. Then I deleted Avast and downloaded bitdefender premium because I read that it was better than the former. I have ran two Bitdefender tests and they both came back with nothing. I also logged out of that email and changed the password to the email on a separate device (although I wonder if this is futile because what if the attacker connected to my wifi network??)\n\nMy question is: I didn’t fill in any information nor did anything visibly download on my computer BUT I am scared that maybe I accidentally downloaded a keylogger on my computer. I have heard that sometimes keyloggers go undetected by malware software. So is my only option to just factory reset my entire laptop? Can bitdefender detect all types of keyloggers? If not bitdefender does anyone else have an idea of what can? I would hope because I would lose files and need to redownload apps, etc. \n\nI also contacted the privacy email of the company to ask if that URL address is theirs. They confirmed with me today that is not their email. I was hoping I was just overreacting because the newsletter looked so real (I know this is so eye-roll worthy to say but it really did, like I hovered over images and they purported to link to the official website).

I've tried to explain that for my number to be added, someone would have needed a 6-digit verification code that Google would have sent to my phone. I never received a code like that, and I definitely never gave one to anyone.\nThey are not accepting this fact and are convinced I'm lying.\nI'm at a total loss. I'm being accused of something I didn't do.\nI have two main questions:\n * How is this technically possible? Could their account have been hacked by a real hacker who, for some bizarre reason, used my phone number? How would that hacker have gotten the verification code from my phone?\n * How can I prove my innocence? I've asked my friend to check their account's security activity (like the \"Details\" link at the bottom of Gmail) which should show the IP address and device that made the change. They are either too freaked out to do it or don't believe me. Is there any way for me to prove it wasn't me?\nWhat do I do now?\nTL;DR: My phone number is on my friend's Google account. I didn't put it there. They are accusing me of hacking them and won't listen to reason. How can I prove I'm innocent?",

No User.000, no duplicates.\n\nIn net user and PowerShell (Get-LocalUser), there’s just one local account — mine.\n\nRegistry under ProfileList only points to C:\\Users\\User.\n\nNo extra Microsoft accounts in “Email & accounts.”\n\n\nBasically, Windows insists there’s a second me, but refuses to show any proof of its existence.\n\nThings I’ve already tried (with no luck):\n\nnetplwiz auto-login settings\n\nDeleting cached logins in Credential Manager\n\nRemoving Windows Hello & Web Sign-in registry entries\n\nChecking for duplicate SIDs in the registry\n\nResetting LastLoggedOnUser\n\nPurging IdentityCache folders\n\nPerforming minor ritual sacrifices (didn’t help either)\n\n\nNow, as a bonus feature, the sign-in options screen says:\n\n “Some of these settings are managed by your organization.”\n…which is funny, because I am the organization.\n\n\n\nAt this point I’m not sure if Windows created a shadow account, or if my PC just got lonely and decided to make a friend.\n\nI’m not a hardcore tech person, but I can handle regedit, PowerShell, and basic admin stuff, granted with some tutorial help - so if anyone has ideas on how to exorcise my ghost profile, I’d love to hear them.\n\nThanks in advance, and may your Windows updates break fewer things than mine",

    "selftext": "Hey yall,\n\nBeen having a problem for a while. Whenever I put my windows pc to sleep and try to wake it up, it's just a black screen, but all the components seem to be running. This happens every time. It also happens occasionally when I restart the pc or have to update it. The pc turns off and on, but back to a black screen. Whenever this happens, I have to force shut it down with the power button and turn it back on. My drivers and windows should be up to date. One thing I can think of is this started happening more when I got this GPU.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas it would be appreciated. Thanks in advanced.\n\nSpecs:  \nCPU: 7900x  \nGPU: 9070XT  \nRAM: 32G DDR5",

    "selftext": "So, my laptop crashed earlier today. I'm not sure why; it happened while it was closed. I closed it and it was fine, brought it upstairs, opened it, and it had crashed. It was a bit of a weird crash, though. It didn't immediately wake up upon opening it. Hitting the power button didn't do anything. I opened and closed it a few times to no avail, and resorted to just holding down the power button for increasingly long periods until the keyboard finally lit up.\n\nIt's been acting weird since then. Once it booted back up, all three USB ports were no longer working. If I plug something into them, the add-on is aware it has been plugged in (USB mouse and keyboard both lit up, external drive started humming) but the laptop itself seemed unaware that anything had been plugged in (mouse and keyboard weren't doing anything, could not access external drive in the file finder). So things plugged into the USB ports are getting power, but that's it.\n\nAnd now the function keys aren't working properly. I'm using a Dell, so F1, F2, and F3 are mute, volume down, and volume up, but they no longer provide volume control. They are only doing their \"function\" jobs. Toggling function lock hasn't done anything.\n\nI'm using a Dell G15 5510 from 2021 that was recently updated to Windows 11. I ran Dell's diagnostics (quick and advanced versions) and they came back saying everything was working fine. Device manager isn't flagging any drivers. Laptop says it's up to date but that an update to Windows 11 version 25H2 is available. I updated the firmware while troubleshooting. It's been rebooted several times at this point. USB ports are still useless and function keys are still unhelpful.",

Click here!!” when connected to wifi, and my fans going crazy.\n\n First I deleted the app, then I rebooted my laptop into safe mode (and updated it) and did a full offline Microsoft defender scan. Nothing showed up so I hopped on and started deleting all my temp files.\n\nWhen it said that a few couldn’t be deleted because they were currently running, I went over to task manager and tried to shut them down there only to be told “access denied.” I have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of these things. It’s three am and I’m sick of it, I’ve tried to change permissions on the tasks/files to no avail, security tab advanced settings are greyed out, and whenever I try to resolve this (for example, restoring TrustedInstaller as the owner) but every time I try something, it tells me that security change cannot be applied to the problem files because \"Failed to enumerate objects in the container.”\n\n \nI looked this up and tried to solve it but I just can’t seem to. Tl:dr I can’t own the files or tasks, and can’t apply new settings to them without the aforementioned error message. I’m new to tech but I’ve really tried all the troubleshoots I’ve come across in my research to no avail, and really need help. If elaboration is needed on any of the issues I’m facing I will gladly provide \n\n(And an additional question, if I delete windows 11 completely and reinstall, would that solve it? this is a really new laptop that I mostly use for the internet, with basically nothing on it, and if I lost what I have on it I wouldn’t really mind. I would rather it not come to this but I’m desperate, lol.)",

    "selftext": "I'm in an absolute nightmare situation and I'm desperate for advice.\nMy friend just contacted me. They discovered that my phone number is listed as a verified phone number on their Google account.\nI have 1000% no idea how it got there. I never accessed their account, I don't know their password, I would never, ever do that.\nNow, they are accusing me of hacking them and trying to steal their account. They are not listening to any of my explanations and are treating me like a criminal. I've tried to explain that for my number to be added, someone would have needed a 6-digit verification code that Google would have sent to my phone. I never received a code like that, and I definitely never gave one to anyone.\nThey are not accepting this fact and are convinced I'm lying.\nI'm at a total loss. I'm being accused of something I didn't do.\nI have two main questions:\n * How is this technically possible? Could their account have been hacked by a real hacker who, for some bizarre reason, used my phone number? How would that hacker have gotten the verification code from my phone?\n * How can I prove my innocence? I've asked my friend to check their account's security activity (like the \"Details\" link at the bottom of Gmail) which should show the IP address and device that made the change. They are either too freaked out to do it or don't believe me. Is there any way for me to prove it wasn't me?\nWhat do I do now?\nTL;DR: My phone number is on my friend's Google account. I didn't put it there. They are accusing me of hacking them and won't listen to reason. How can I prove I'm innocent?",

When I open my BIOS, it says \"UEFI / Legacy\", and it seems the only way to change this option is to enable WHQL support, then restart and load back into BIOS.\n\nThe issue I'm having is that once I enable WHQL support, I can no longer get into BIOS. The computer will load to the login screen, but if i try to access BIOS on startup, or once logged in, the computer simply turns on and does nothing. Lights come on, fans come up, but that's it.\n\nThis may help diagnose, but when it's in that stage, pressing the power button immediately shuts the computer off.",

    "selftext": "Hello I need some help,\n\nSo I made the switch to Windows 11 last night and I'm having issues with Windows Firewall. When I go into the Firewall settings in control panel and try to change any setting, it gives me an error message. The error message says \"Windows Defender Firewall can't change some of your settings. Error code 0x800706d9\". First I tried restarting and it didn't work. Then I installed a repair version. After the repair version finished installing, the firewall seems to work. I was able to go into the Firewall settings and view them. I shut my pc off for the night. Fast forward to tonight, and after I boot up my pc, I get the same notification to turn on Windows Firewall I first got when I updated to Windows 11. Now I can't change the Firewall settings, and it gives me the same error message.\n\n  \nI'm not sure if this is a major issue and if it is, how can I fix it? \n\n  \nI'm on Windows 11 version 25H2\n\n  \n",

Not bad for plastics, reasonably solid, backlight adjustable via software and pleasantly clicky Gateron switches.\n\nUnfortunately, a few months later it started hissing at very high frequencies (which my misophonic ear, although elderly, can pick up) from a specific point on the body, located more or less between the letter \"D\" and the letter \"F\". It drives me crazy. I tried turning off the lighting and the problem isn't due to that.\n\nWhat could it be? Low level capacitors? How could I fix it?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo this started right after a recent Windows 11 update - every time I boot up, the login screen shows two accounts with my exact same name. One of them is automatically selected and asks for a password (which I never used to need), and I have to manually switch to my real account to log in.\n\nThe weird part:\n\nOnce I’m logged in, if I try to “Switch user,” that mysterious second account vanishes completely.\n\nIn C:\\Users, I only have User and Public. No User.000, no duplicates.\n\nIn net user and PowerShell (Get-LocalUser), there’s just one local account — mine.\n\nRegistry under ProfileList only points to C:\\Users\\User.\n\nNo extra Microsoft accounts in “Email & accounts.”\n\n\nBasically, Windows insists there’s a second me, but refuses to show any proof of its existence.\n\nThings I’ve already tried (with no luck):\n\nnetplwiz auto-login settings\n\nDeleting cached logins in Credential Manager\n\nRemoving Windows Hello & Web Sign-in registry entries\n\nChecking for duplicate SIDs in the registry\n\nResetting LastLoggedOnUser\n\nPurging IdentityCache folders\n\nPerforming minor ritual sacrifices (didn’t help either)\n\n\nNow, as a bonus feature, the sign-in options screen says:\n\n “Some of these settings are managed by your organization.”\n…which is funny, because I am the organization.\n\n\n\nAt this point I’m not sure if Windows created a shadow account, or if my PC just got lonely and decided to make a friend.\n\nI’m not a hardcore tech person, but I can handle regedit, PowerShell, and basic admin stuff, granted with some tutorial help - so if anyone has ideas on how to exorcise my ghost profile, I’d love to hear them.\n\nThanks in advance, and may your Windows updates break fewer things than mine",
