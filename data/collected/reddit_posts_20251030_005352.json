Right out of the box, inside the store, it wouldn’t connect to WiFi, it wouldn’t connect to 5G or LTE and it had to be connected via Ethernet. That phone had problems right out of the box and when we asked if we could get another phone that didn’t need to be connected via Ethernet for set up (while my mom had her iPhone 13 Pro out of the box set up beautifully with no extra support needed, they refused). \n\nJust now I got an Apple Pencil. Brand new. Off the Apple Store App. Engraved. And it only HALF works. It can click stuff. That’s it. It will not draw. \n\nOn procreate, the eraser works, smudge and paint don’t. On ArtStudio pro, nothing works. And on the iOS notes app, it draws. It was als\n\nMy really cheap $30 off brand “Apple” pencil works beautiful for everything though. \n\nI’ve reset the iPad, the pencil (forget this device), I’ve swapped out the Apple Pencil tips (official ones, even the bootleg one has an official tip on it) and it doesn’t work. \n\nIt wasn’t closed all the way (the tip) and won’t close all the way. I’m going to take this pencil into the Apple Store and ask for one that’s actually new or a refund if they give me another busted pencil. \n\nI might as well have bought three bootleg pencils and I’d have saved money and wouldn’t have products that actually work. \n",

    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "I'm a doctor and built a responsive breathing app for anxiety and sleep. It's now App of the Day!! (75% off lifetime to celebrate)",
    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

AirPods weren’t as loud at same volume, distorted sounds, no bass, very flat (no dynamic range). This all coincided with AirPod pro 2 firmware updated in September and iOS updates at same time.\n\nI suspected the problem was with my AirPod pro 2 being dirty and not calibrating correctly after the firmware update, so I bought the AirPod pro 3 figuring my 2’s were shot. Mild improvement, sound was better but still sucked compared to my 2’s in August before updates.\n\nMy iphone 17 pro came in today. All of a sudden, both my AirPod pro 2 and 3 both sound pristine, as my 2’s did on my 12 pro just months ago. APPLE DELIVERATELY NERFED MY IPHONE 12 PRO BLUETOOTH WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE.\n\nThey do planned obsolescence , but I buy their products anyway cause when they’re new they’re the best. But seriously?

I may not be able to look at them now but there may be a time in the future where I need them. I would like them to be saved in a format that could be accessed in the future so nothing that will become obsolete. It is vital that this be secure since I know for a fact that my entire family's social security numbers, debit card and bank account info, and passwords are in those messages. \n\nI've searched google and there doesn't seem to be a way to save messages without scrolling all the way back (extremely painful to do, and we're talking hundreds of thousands of messages), or using a sketchy third party program (not secure).

It happens roughly twice a month, and it’s completely unpredictable. One day everything works fine, and the next day my phone just stops ringing — when I check the settings, the ringtone volume slider is set to minimum.\n\nI first noticed this problem on my iPhone 13 Pro Max, and now it’s happening again on my iPhone 17, so it’s clearly not device-specific.\n\nHere’s what I’ve already tried:\n\nTurned off “Change with Buttons” under Sounds & Haptics\nTurned off “Attention Aware Features” \nChecked that no Focus mode or Do Not Disturb is active\nDisabled Bluetooth to rule out volume syncing with external devices\nUpdated to the latest iOS version\n\nNone of this has helped. The ringtone volume still sometimes lowers itself without warning.\n\nThis is a really unreliable and frustrating bug, because I can’t tell when my phone will stop ringing — and I’ve already missed important calls because of it.\n\nHas anyone found a definitive fix or workaround for this issue?\n",

I want to disable it permanently. Even when I switch between Ring Mode and Silent Mode, the sound still happens. How can I turn this off?\n\n2️⃣ **Cover Screen always on**  \nWhy does the Cover Screen (the screen that shows the time before unlocking) never go completely black? Even if I just leave the phone on the table, the clock is still visible. How can I make the screen fully black/off?\n\n3️⃣ **Cover Screen Theme**  \nIt seems like the new iPhone 17 themes are mostly glass-style designs. I don’t like that. Is it possible to change it back to a more basic theme like the ones on older iPhones?  \nFor reference, I upgraded from an iPhone 13 to the iPhone 17 — quite a big jump.\n\n4️⃣ **Any useful features to recommend?**  \nSince I skipped a few generations, are there any special new features on the iPhone 17 that many people might not know about, but are very useful?\n\nThanks a lot in advance for your help!",

I learned that it accepts any password but if the password is wrong it just erases the phone without a warning. I lost a lot of important data and i’ve been trying a lot of ways to find the right password. I looked to the keychain access and found nothing, i looked to the keychain access at my mac and found the same password ive been trying, i tried every password i have ever used and even tried brute force but looks like it would take thousands of years. What can i try now? Dont tell me its gone please, everbody tells me its gone but i want to learn about the solutions no matter how hard it is.",

I defended their choices when people complained about Siri, about the lack of customization, about the walled garden. I used to believe Apple’s simplicity had soul.\n\nBut then came iOS 26 (and macOS 26). And for the first time, I feel completely disconnected from what Apple used to stand for.\n\nI actually went through the effort of erasing my Mac and reinstalling macOS 15 — just to get that old feeling back. The smoothness, the warmth, the balance between design and performance… everything that made Apple, Apple.\n\nAnd now, I catch myself wishing I could do the same for my iPhone — to downgrade from iOS 26 back to iOS 18. But of course, Apple doesn’t make that easy.\n\nIt’s not just the software, either. I don’t understand the obsession with bigger displays. I miss the days when holding an iPhone felt comfortable — human. Now every phone feels like a tablet pretending to be a phone. Why can’t they hear us? Why can’t they listen to the people who loved the 13 mini and the SE?\n\nFor the first time, I’m genuinely thinking of stepping back — maybe buying a refurbished iPhone 13 mini, or even an SE or 8. Something smaller, simpler, quieter. Something that feels like me again.\n\nBecause somewhere between updates and design trends, Apple stopped listening. And maybe it’s time I stopped too.\n",

    "selftext": "I just got an open box iPhone 13 mini (128gb) recently.  It appears to be brand new in box, battery health is 100%, screen and body is mint.  Everything works perfectly about it, except for one problem where it seems to turn off (sometimes) when in my pocket.\n\nI updated the phone to iOS 26 as soon as I got it, so I cannot confirm if this was happening on the older iOS.  I previously updated from a 1st gen SE, which didn't have this problem (in the same pockets.)\n\nBasically, I'll look at my phone, lock it with the side button, put it in my pocket.  Sometimes when I take it out again and try to unlock it, it's off.  I can hold the power button for a second and it will boot up and runs as normal, battery is where it was before.  I checked the logs and there are no \"panics\".  I've tried disabling features like \"tap to wake\", \"raise to wake\", etc. in case it was somehow affecting it, no change.  I also have an official (probably not counterfeit?) leather case, which I've taken off for testing and the problem persists.  I have never had this happen outside of a pocket, even if I try to replicate it (holding it upright, rubbing it against the outside of the pocket.)\n\nThe company I bought it from has offered to exchange the phone already, but I'd rather not go through all the hassle if it's something I can figure out and fix.\n\nI've also searched around on google, and found other people describing the same problem, usually without any follow up or solution, and most replies point to it being a battery problem.  However, if that were the case, why only when in a \"pocket\"?\n\nI've also tried cleaning out the charging port, even though it looked perfectly clean, no change.\n\nOne thing I've also noticed:  when this happens there seems to be a ExcUserFault\\_MobileSafari log event at around the same time, though I wouldn't have been using Safari.    I only see these for \"MobileSafari\" and the reportNotes says \"PC register does not match crashing frame (0x0 vs (some value)).  I'm also not 100% sure these match up with the shut downs, but I'll check for one the next time it happens.\n\nAnd one last thing: I've read that a bad sim card can cause random shutdowns restarts?  I am using a physical sim (same that was in my SE) but I can't see any connection between this type of problem, and the phone being in my pocket.\n\nAny ideas?",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

I’ve had an iPhone 8 since 2018, and of course it’s finally died on me (I think I did well to get this far). I’m now trying to decide which iPhone to get as a replacement, but of course don’t want to spend too much money as I don’t use it to make content or things like that, and loved that I was only paying for data rather than a phone too each month. I already have a sim with data etc, and have found the iPhone 17 in the UK for £24 per month for 36 months, and the iPhone 14 for £15 per month for 36 months (with the 15 and 16 priced appropriately in between). My question is, for someone who wants their phone to last as long as possible, which would you go for? Is there really that much difference between the 14 and 17 for the non-expert such as myself, that would justify paying 60% more per month? I figured the 17 would last longer than the 14, but any advice as to which phone is best (and whether certain features are worth having) would be really appreciated.Thanks guys. ",

Back in my Android days, I used to easily move photos from the Camera folder into different folders based on categories (Family, Friends, Official, Trips etc) just simple select and move. Then, whenever my phone was running out of space, I’d simply connect it to my PC via cable and cut andpaste those folders. My phone stayed clean, and everything was neatly sorted on my PC.\n\n\n\nI’ve been trying to find a simple way to do the same with my iPhone but haven’t had any success. I do have iCloud backup, but I also want an **offline backup that’s PROPERLY sorted**.\n\n\n\nIs there any easy way to do this? It would honestly be a life saver.",

Any case you get (at least semi-transparent ones) start to come apart at the seems very quickly. After 4 cases this has happened each time, sometimes within a day of use and sometimes after a couple months. Google and you will find it’s a common problem. The plastic bordering the camera that has their own logo on it also cracks very quickly. Ten day return window should have been a red flag to me. If you ask for a warranty replacement they will honor it ONCE but will not warranty that replacement case even if it starts to fall apart 3 days later. If you push back on this they’ll send you another replacement but won’t give you a refund, which doesn’t help since it’s a recurring quality problem. Super disappointed since they have cute designs and they’re expensive af. Better off getting a brand like Speck and putting stickers on it. I’ve had $10 Amazon cases last far, far longer. You also have to EMAIL them in order to leave a review on their website, which explains how they have no 1 star reviews on their site. Very misleading. ",

I’m now trying to decide which iPhone to get, but of course don’t want to spend too much money as I don’t use it to make content or things like that. I already have a sim with data etc, and have found the iPhone 17 in the UK for £24 per month for 36 months, and the iPhone 14 for £15 per month for 36 months (with the 15 and 16 priced appropriately in between). My question is, for someone who wants their phone to last as long as possible, which would you go for? Is there really that much difference between the 14 and 17 for the non-expert such as myself, that would justify paying 60% more per month? I figured the 17 would last longer than the 14, but any advice as to which phone is best would be really appreciated. Thanks guys. ",

One day everything works fine, and the next day my phone just stops ringing — when I check the settings, the ringtone volume slider is set to minimum.\n\nI first noticed this problem on my iPhone 13 Pro Max, and now it’s happening again on my iPhone 17, so it’s clearly not device-specific.\n\nHere’s what I’ve already tried:\n\nTurned off “Change with Buttons” under Sounds & Haptics\nTurned off “Attention Aware Features” \nChecked that no Focus mode or Do Not Disturb is active\nDisabled Bluetooth to rule out volume syncing with external devices\nUpdated to the latest iOS version\n\nNone of this has helped. The ringtone volume still sometimes lowers itself without warning.\n\nThis is a really unreliable and frustrating bug, because I can’t tell when my phone will stop ringing — and I’ve already missed important calls because of it.\n\nHas anyone found a definitive fix or workaround for this issue?\n",

I’ve had an iPhone 8 since 2018, and of course it’s finally died on me (I think I did well to get this far). I’m now trying to decide which iPhone to get as a replacement, but of course don’t want to spend too much money as I don’t use it to make content or things like that, and loved that I was only paying for data rather than a phone too each month. I already have a sim with data etc, and have found the iPhone 17 in the UK for £24 per month for 36 months, and the iPhone 14 for £15 per month for 36 months (with the 15 and 16 priced appropriately in between). My question is, for someone who wants their phone to last as long as possible, which would you go for? Is there really that much difference between the 14 and 17 for the non-expert such as myself, that would justify paying 60% more per month? I figured the 17 would last longer than the 14, but any advice as to which phone is best (and whether certain features are worth having) would be really appreciated.Thanks guys. ",

My phone stayed clean, and everything was neatly sorted on my PC.\n\n\n\nI’ve been trying to find a simple way to do the same with my iPhone but haven’t had any success.

Any case you get (at least semi-transparent ones) start to come apart at the seems very quickly. After 4 cases this has happened each time, sometimes within a day of use and sometimes after a couple months. Google and you will find it’s a common problem. The plastic bordering the camera that has their own logo on it also cracks very quickly. Ten day return window should have been a red flag to me. If you ask for a warranty replacement they will honor it ONCE but will not warranty that replacement case even if it starts to fall apart 3 days later. If you push back on this they’ll send you another replacement but won’t give you a refund, which doesn’t help since it’s a recurring quality problem. Super disappointed since they have cute designs and they’re expensive af. Better off getting a brand like Speck and putting stickers on it. I’ve had $10 Amazon cases last far, far longer. You also have to EMAIL them in order to leave a review on their website, which explains how they have no 1 star reviews on their site. Very misleading. ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’m an indie Android developer, and over the past few months I’ve been working on something that brings back the old-school radio experience — but built for the modern Android ecosystem.\n\nThe app lets users:  \n📻 Listen to **50,000+ live radio stations** from around the world (music, news, talk, podcasts).  \n🌎 **Browse by Country, Genre, or Language** — for example, K-Pop from Korea or classic rock from the US.  \n🔎 **Global Search** — find any station by keyword, location, or genre.  \n❤️ **Favorite stations** to build your personal list.  \n😴 **Sleep Timer & Auto Start** — one of my favorite features for night listening.\n\nMy focus was on keeping it lightweight, responsive, and aligned with Android design principles — no clutter, just pure listening.\n\nI’d love to hear from **Android enthusiasts** about what makes a radio or music app *feel native* and enjoyable on Android.\n\n* Do you prefer Material-You dynamic theming?\n* Would background playback controls via notification or lock screen make a difference?\n* Any UI or UX preferences that make you stay longer in such apps?\n\n👉 For those curious, it’s available on the Play Store here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio)\n\nHappy to take feedback, discuss architecture, and chat about how I implemented global streaming efficiently for Android.\n\nThanks for reading — your suggestions can genuinely help me polish this for future updates 🙏",

    "selftext": "you started to see some actions which knowing that google will block sideloading of non certified apps now make sense. \n\nAmazon is killing Fire OS, Fire OS is based in android 9 to 11 but they are replacing it with Vega OS on their streaming devices (which is absolte crap, its basically a OS for remote apps) and some appliances, while at the same time declaring that a new Amazon tablet will be out in 2026 with Androidn 16, meaning that that the main point of contention with Google was blocking sideloading so people could stop using their devices as general media devices instead of amazon media consumption devices.\n\nWe also had Oppo (and other BBK brands) Xiaomi and Samsung saying they would break away from the GMS ecosystem at some times, Samsung is the most advance with their accesories using Tizen instead of Android or Wear OS and having their own samsung pay service separated from Google wallet.\n\nso those details all coming togather brings us to looking it from 2 different points. \n\nAre the brands who make android based devices pressuing google to close their ecosystem and now that google has agreed we are seeing companies like Amazon allowing GMS in to their devices again (even if its just tablets).\n\nOr Google is using 3rd party vendors as an excuse to close their ecosystem, i know google  went from \"dont be evil\" to \"we are evil in person\" but i think this is a culmination of years of pressure from inside and outside google to become more like an iphone and close the system. \n\nwhats your opinion on the matter ?",

Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 → LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B → JN5",

I thought it was coming from the charging port, but it was actually coming from the vent(?) on the bottom left side of the phone. There was no visible smoke or anything sparking or melting from what I can see. To this day it still smells like somethings burnt if I put my nose up to the bottom of it even though it hasn't been on or plugged in since.\n\nMy family insists there's nothing wrong with it, and I should keep using it, but I've refused and they think I'm overreacting because I'm a minor.

    "selftext": "The past few months, my Pixel 8 has randomly flickered green. Sometimes it's only a little greenish tint, sometimes it renders my phone unusable because the screen looks like green static. Through Reddit, I discovered that a gentle squeeze on the bottom of the phone would (sometimes) fix the issue, albeit temporarily. I didn't really want to continue this practice and potentially damage the phone.\n\nTwo nights ago, it was flickering, but wouldn't go back with a gentle squeeze. I put it on its charger and in the morning, it was fine, no more green. However, now there is a neon vertical line off-center to the right side of the screen that extends from the top to the bottom and does not go away. \n\nI contacted customer service yesterday and they told me that, if I could send them the invoice for the phone purchase, we could go over potential options (they told me that based on purchase date, it was out of warranty). I was at work and didn't have this proof of purchase on me, but they said I could send them the invoice at any point in the next 24 hours. I went to the local AT&T store and retrieved the invoice for the phone, then sent it along in the support chat. \n\nAt this point, the person (or bot) I was chatting with had changed names. After sending the receipt, I was informed that my only options were to either mail it to them or take it to a UBreakIFix location that was out-of-state and inconvenient for travel. I asked why they had me retrieve the invoice, and got different answers from multiple reps, including a supervisor. I believe that, ultimately, it was not necessary.\n\nHas anyone else had to jump through hoops to have this issue fixed? \n\nI'm kind of annoyed that the onus of repair is put entirely on the customer when Google is aware of this problem, which was created on their end.

While contacting Google Support with enquiry number [6-4504000039517] I had sent photos of the phone with the Display working perfectly.\n\nAfter Google received the phone, I was informed that I would either have to pay INR 14,542 ($160 ) for a so‑called display issue or have the phone returned unrepaired. This was unreasonable because there was no display defect when I sent the phone, and the screen separation was entirely due to the swollen battery. I have photos of the screen working absolutely fine. \n\nFrom my experience, I am convinced that Google’s authorized repair centers in India are engaging in unethical practices. They are citing fake display issues to charge customers which is a pure Scam.\n\nFirst Google manufactures Substandard Product. I have not seen even cheap Chinese Phones with Sub INR 10k swelling up suddenly within 2 years as with this shit Pixel 7. And now the Service Centre in Noida is trying to Scam me by saying perfectly working Display needs to be changed. \n\nBecause of this I have now lost trust in Google’s repair process. What options do I have now? Has anyone else experienced the same?\n\nScreenshot showing working display while Chatting with Google Support Attached.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been on iOS for \\~15 years. I decided not to get the iPhone 17 Pro Max after feeling there wasn’t much real innovation over the last four years and jumped to a Pixel 10 Pro XL for the AI features. The phone feels legitimately powerful and I like a lot about it.\n\nOne thing is driving me nuts. When I try to swipe horizontally, a slight diagonal thumb swipe often turns into a vertical scroll. On iOS, the system seems to “get” my intent and direction-locks to horizontal. On Android, it feels like the UI commits to vertical too easily unless my swipe is perfectly straight.\n\nWhere I see it most  \n• Walmart cart screen: the horizontal suggestions under the cart love to scroll the page vertically instead of sliding sideways.  \n• Amazon product pages: the horizontal “Sponsored” product carousels often scroll the page vertically on small diagonals.  \n• Messenger apps: media carousels and horizontal chips regularly misinterpret diagonals.\n\nWhat I already tried  \n• Fully updated system and apps  \n• Tuned back-gesture edge sensitivity  \n• Turned on touch-sensitivity / screen-protector mode(Just checked it out although I have no screen protection on)  \n• Temporarily used 3-button nav while testing\n\nQuestions  \n• Do you see the same diagonal-to-vertical behavior on recent Pixels?  \n• Any hidden settings, flags, or launcher/gesture tweaks that improve horizontal direction-locking?  \n• If you moved from iOS, did this bother you at first and then fade as you adjusted your swipe angle?\n\nConstructive ask to Google/Android devs  \nPlease prioritize this. Bias the recognition toward horizontal when the initial movement suggests a sideways swipe, or give us a setting to prefer horizontal direction-lock. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is fantastic overall, but this one behavior makes you miss the “smooth and floating” feel that IOS has.",

    "selftext": "One thing I've found weird was the Pixel 10 Pro's **brightness and shadow sliders are swapped** compared to previous phones. I confirmed this is on Camera 10.0 AND Camera 10.1 (I got the update yesterday).\n\nIt's always been muscle memory for me to adjust the shadows a bit because I don't like the crushed shadows look. Over the past few weeks I've found it frustrating that it seems my images don't adjust the way I want it to and only last week it dawned upon me after looking at the icons more closely that the sliders are swapped compared to my Pixel 9 and older phones and I've been adjusting brightness on my Pixel 10 the first few weeks when I intended to adjust shadows.\n\nYesterday I wondered if it was a Camera 10.1 change and so I updated my Pixel 9 Pro to Camera 10.1 too. **The order stays the same on Camera 10.1 where brightness is on top on the Pixel 9 Pro**. In some further investigation I opened Pro Mode and I wonder if this is the reason--in pro mode, Shadows appears first on the Pixel 10 whereas Brightness appears first on the Pixel 9. Perhaps this order is also linked to why the sliders are swapped on the Pixel 10.\n\n**Clearing data/storage on my Pixel 10 doesn't change anything**\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n* Pixel 9 Pro on Camera 9.9 and 10.1: Brightness Top, Shadows Bottom\n\n* Pixel 10 Pro on Camera 10.0 and 10.1: Brightness Bottom, Shadows Top\n\nScreenshots: https://i.imgur.com/cbKyEhd.png",

I had no problems whatsoever. After updating to Android 16, that's where the problems started. The signal icon automatically appears with an exclamation mark (!) and no signal at all. It's ONLY fixed by restarting, but it only works for 3-5 minutes before it goes back to the same thing. No signal, no data, NOTHING. What did you do to the modem in Android 16, Google? Is this a strategy to get me to switch to a new Pixel and then do the same thing? I've tried everything: factory reset, changing SIM cards, reinstalling the software, and nothing fixes it I've seen it on different forums, and it really is a real problem affecting 4 out of 10 Pixel 8 Pro users. It's truly outrageous that Google hasn't provided a real solution, knowing full well that thousands of Pixel 8 Pro users are experiencing the SAME problem after the update. The worst part is that my warranty expired about 6 months ago, so I'm the one who loses out. I'm sure that if Google doesn't release an update that fixes the modem issue, I'll never buy another Pixel phone again.",

    "title": "I got the OFFICIAL Camera Update (10.1.076.821848723.18). The Verdict: THE STUTTER IS NOT FIXED.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.🤝**",

    "selftext": "So for the past 24 hours I've been trying to understand why my Google AI Plan (the Gemini and 2tb plan) wasn't included with my purchase of the Pixel 9 Pro last year, as advertised. Just to be clear, I bought the phone in January when the promotion was still active, I received the offer, but when I went to redeem the offer apparently it didn't work correctly and instead it put me on a paid plan. I wasn't paying attention, which is totally my fault, and didn't notice I was getting charged $9.99 a month for the 2tb plan, instead. The customer service agents I spoke to told me there as an error with the offer, which is why it wasn't redeemed correctly. They are also telling me too bad, and that there is nothing I can do... So apparently a glitch in their system is my fault, and they are willing to lose a customer over it. I just don't understand how we got to this point. Its clear that the many customer service reps aren't given the authority to help me, and I get that, but they can't even elevate my case to someone that can help. I am soooooo understanding of how horrible it must be to work customer service and I deal with people like this every day for my job, I know it isn't their fault. But why is Google so comfortable with losing a customer over something so trivial? I've had Pixel's since day one, been a google customer since gmail came out, and have joined Insider programs to be a part of the community... Why do they think its ok to treat customers like this after admitting it wasn't my fault?",

She said, no problem and hung up. \n\nI think if you're very concerned about this potential issue, just call the non emergency number for your city and explain it to them. The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes.

    "selftext": "I wanted to make this because so many people complain on this subreddit about the phone not being fast enough, or having the best specs, etc, etc and wanted to give my perspective as a lifelong Android user since I got my first Smartphone, which was an HTC myTouch in 2010.\n\nThe reality is, Google has moved past a specs race and enthusiast market with this phone and the past recent pixel phones, and it's evident not only in their marketing for it and how they want you to use their phone with Gemini, but also who they're targeting in general.\n\nIn the past, the phone was aimed at enthusiast and it flopped. I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

    "selftext": "Hello !\n\nI got a problem with my week old 9a, I charged it last night to around 66%, the phone wasnt warm at all. I woke up during the night and the phone was unbelievably hot. System settings said that it was around 40°C, which is right at the threshold of it being slightly overheating. I was in 5g, it wasn't charging, the screen wasn turned off for hours although I do have always on display activated and I wasn't in sleep modee, I have adaptive battery on and only have allowed unlimited background activity to a couple apps like Instagram or Discord in order to get their notifications as soon as they arrive. \n\nThe only thing I can think of was that it was underneath my pillow while I was sleeping, but it shouldn't have generated that amount of heat if it wasn't doing something. That and the always on display being on that night. 10% of battery disappeared between when I stopped charging and when I noticed the heat, Instagram was the app that used the most battery during this time. I only ever had 3 or 4 percent disappearing during an entire night, so 10% in 3-4 hours seems like a lot.\n\nThe phone doesn't even heat that much when using it intensively or when charging. The heat wasn't located in a single spot, it was all over the screen at the same level. I had to turn it off in order for it to go back to normal, and since then, nothing.\n\nHas anyone ever encountered a problem like this ? I've seen reports of heating issues with these phones on Reddit but nothing that matches my experience.",

Currently I have OneUI on mine cuz I like Sammy's design. But anyways. For full freedom, I think pixels the way to go (for now) \n\nAnother thing is performance, using Samsung phone it slowed down randomly. Prolly Samsung and carrier bloat on top of Googles stuff. I got my pixel unlocked and use it with mint, works great. I usually see people complain about pixel performance but even switch and wiiu emulator run at 50 plus fps usually.\n\nTldr I bought it when it was cheaper than the 10a cuz it was a year behind and am blown away for it.

Also - I don't think that normal for a new phone to be at 100% battery? Unless something changed wiith tech I think its quite unusual.\n\nI know battery apps are not usually perfect but I get the same amount of 4200 reported from one that measures via charging cycles, and one that reads the hardware info directly from the device.\n\n**Authenticity checker / QR Code**\n\nI've read on the device authenticity checker that genuine products should come with a holographic QR code but I don't recall seeing one on my last Pixel, so I could be wrong?\n\nAlso the manufacturing year mismatch via the authenticity checker seems off to me but no idea if there could be a genuine discrepancy? My other pixels self reported dates matched the ones on this site.\n\nIts a shame that we can no longer see the \"first activated\" date.\n\n**Phone Region**\n\nI'm guessing if the phone was manufactured in China, that's why it might prompt me to set the region as China when first loading? Again I have bought pixels before and never seen this, but I think I did see somthing similer with my oneplus.\n\nAnyway, I'd be grateful for anyone more knowledgable to chime in and let me know if my suspicions are correct - I don't mind having a refurb, but I could have paid less by *intentionally* buying one.",

Despite being more expensive, I prefer to use the accessories from Google's store because third-party has been such a crapshoot for me in the past...\n\n\\- Case-Mate Lens Protector for Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL camera (has it negatively impacted the image quality of your photos and/or videos?)\n\n\\-ZAGG InvisibleShield® Glass Elite for Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL (does it have the big hole where the thumbprint verify would be, which makes watching YouTube videos obnoxious? I looked at the product photos and it doesn't appear to have the thumbprint hole, but I've still been burned in the past by incorrect product photos when I tried to buy a replacement screen protector for my 6 Pro) \\*unfortunately the cheaper screen protector provided by Case-Mate is currently out of stock and I have no idea when or if it'll come back\n\n\\-Pixelsnap Charger with Stand (this is the big one; my main issue is that my previous Pixel Stand Charger that I used with the 6 Pro is very slow to charge my new 10 Pro XL because I guess they changed how the charging works)\n\n\\-finally, what Pixelsnap compatible case are you using? There's quite a few options and it's kind of overwhelming because there doesn't seem to be any reviews displayed for any of these accessories. Ideally I'd like one that protrudes out enough to protect the cameras on the back of the phone so I can maybe skip on buying a glass screen protector for the cameras, but it's difficult for me to tell if any of the cases are like that.\n\nIt's fine if you don't have the XL specifically, but have the regular 10 or the 10 Pro. And it's fine if you can only answer some or one of these.",

    "selftext": "So, I know there's a zillion photo editing apps out there but, hear me out..\n\nWhen I want to quickly edit a photo, crop, markup, rotate etc, I just use the Google Pixel 8 Pro default editor. Straight forward, opens and saves fast.\n\nBut, it's not great. For example. I want to block someone out of the photo (College Lecturer, infront, in the middle of the digital whiteboard), the only way to do that is use the markup pen, with the width of a human hair, to scribble that person out! Which takes forEVER!\n\nWouldn't it be easier if 1) We could change the thickness of the pen. Or 2) Just add a few black boxes over said person. Even a 'Blur' brush, so we could blur that person out.\n\nI'm fully aware of Photoshop Express, Lightroom, Photoshop online (Adobe full package user) etc. But they take time to load up + load / import the image > edit it > save / export it > find which ever folder it's in > Move the image to the DCIM / Camera folder then it's date is different to the rest, so it's not in order... Yea, it's a faff.\n\nSo, @Google (do they even read this forum?), please, could you just add some more basic features to the default Google photo editing app?\n\n* Edit the pen thickness.\n* Add coloured shapes.\n* A blur tool to blur specific parts of an image.\n* Maybe an 'add other image, to the edit' option. Etc\n\nI'm sure Google has a mountain of people it can call upon to do this? Idk. Just a suggestion.\n\nKind regards, Dragonfyr",

Google tells me there's nothing they can do beyond this and tell me they're going to replace the phone to solve this issue. Great!  Then I mention there's cosmetic damage on the screen. Nope!!! \"Since the device has some physical damages, this will void the warranty\"\n\nThe cosmetic damage on the screen has nothing to do with my issue, completely unrelated.

( had to make an account to make this fucking post )\n\nNo I was not:\n\nGripping the phone- I had one hand on it and an open grasp so my thumb could scroll.\n\nChanging temperatures too quickly- I've been sitting in a room at 69 degrees studying for about an hour. Have had it on a table not in the sun.\n\nI have NEVER dropped this thing. \n\nI'm at a loss, and disappointed. If it had cost me more than 200$ I'd be pissed.\n\n\n ",

    "title": "I got the OFFICIAL Camera Update (10.1.076.821848723.18). The Verdict: THE STUTTER IS NOT FIXED.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.🤝**",

Solution: call your city's NON emergency 911 number. The person then routed me to a dispatcher. I asked if there was a way for me to test if my phone would dial 911 properly. She told me just to hang up and call 911 right now. I did that, the same dispatcher picked up. I told her it's me again, thanks for letting me test it. She said, no problem and hung up. \n\nI think if you're very concerned about this potential issue, just call the non emergency number for your city and explain it to them. The dispatcher is more than happy to help.\n\nYou will get a prompt after you hang up that says your phone is open for emergency callback for 5 minutes. You can select the notification and dismiss this. ",

    "selftext": "I wanted to make this because so many people complain on this subreddit about the phone not being fast enough, or having the best specs, etc, etc and wanted to give my perspective as a lifelong Android user since I got my first Smartphone, which was an HTC myTouch in 2010.\n\nThe reality is, Google has moved past a specs race and enthusiast market with this phone and the past recent pixel phones, and it's evident not only in their marketing for it and how they want you to use their phone with Gemini, but also who they're targeting in general.\n\nIn the past, the phone was aimed at enthusiast and it flopped. I was one of those people, I had the OG Pixel, and the Pixel 3 XL, phones that sales wise, could be considered a failure. But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

    "selftext": "I’ve been on iOS for \\~15 years. I decided not to get the iPhone 17 Pro Max after feeling there wasn’t much real innovation over the last four years and jumped to a Pixel 10 Pro XL for the AI features. The phone feels legitimately powerful and I like a lot about it.\n\nOne thing is driving me nuts. When I try to swipe horizontally, a slight diagonal thumb swipe often turns into a vertical scroll. On iOS, the system seems to “get” my intent and direction-locks to horizontal. On Android, it feels like the UI commits to vertical too easily unless my swipe is perfectly straight.\n\nWhere I see it most  \n• Walmart cart screen: the horizontal suggestions under the cart love to scroll the page vertically instead of sliding sideways.  \n• Amazon product pages: the horizontal “Sponsored” product carousels often scroll the page vertically on small diagonals.  \n• Messenger apps: media carousels and horizontal chips regularly misinterpret diagonals.\n\nWhat I already tried  \n• Fully updated system and apps  \n• Tuned back-gesture edge sensitivity  \n• Turned on touch-sensitivity / screen-protector mode(Just checked it out although I have no screen protection on)  \n• Temporarily used 3-button nav while testing\n\nQuestions  \n• Do you see the same diagonal-to-vertical behavior on recent Pixels?  \n• Any hidden settings, flags, or launcher/gesture tweaks that improve horizontal direction-locking?  \n• If you moved from iOS, did this bother you at first and then fade as you adjusted your swipe angle?\n\nConstructive ask to Google/Android devs  \nPlease prioritize this. Bias the recognition toward horizontal when the initial movement suggests a sideways swipe, or give us a setting to prefer horizontal direction-lock. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is fantastic overall, but this one behavior makes you miss the “smooth and floating” feel that IOS has.",

I confirmed this is on Camera 10.0 AND Camera 10.1 (I got the update yesterday).\n\nIt's always been muscle memory for me to adjust the shadows a bit because I don't like the crushed shadows look. Over the past few weeks I've found it frustrating that it seems my images don't adjust the way I want it to and only last week it dawned upon me after looking at the icons more closely that the sliders are swapped compared to my Pixel 9 and older phones and I've been adjusting brightness on my Pixel 10 the first few weeks when I intended to adjust shadows.\n\nYesterday I wondered if it was a Camera 10.1 change and so I updated my Pixel 9 Pro to Camera 10.1 too. **The order stays the same on Camera 10.1 where brightness is on top on the Pixel 9 Pro**. In some further investigation I opened Pro Mode and I wonder if this is the reason--in pro mode, Shadows appears first on the Pixel 10 whereas Brightness appears first on the Pixel 9. Perhaps this order is also linked to why the sliders are swapped on the Pixel 10.\n\n**Clearing data/storage on my Pixel 10 doesn't change anything**\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n* Pixel 9 Pro on Camera 9.9 and 10.1: Brightness Top, Shadows Bottom\n\n* Pixel 10 Pro on Camera 10.0 and 10.1: Brightness Bottom, Shadows Top\n\nScreenshots: https://i.imgur.com/cbKyEhd.png",

    "selftext": "The past few months, my Pixel 8 has randomly flickered green. Sometimes it's only a little greenish tint, sometimes it renders my phone unusable because the screen looks like green static. Through Reddit, I discovered that a gentle squeeze on the bottom of the phone would (sometimes) fix the issue, albeit temporarily. I didn't really want to continue this practice and potentially damage the phone.\n\nTwo nights ago, it was flickering, but wouldn't go back with a gentle squeeze. I put it on its charger and in the morning, it was fine, no more green. However, now there is a neon vertical line off-center to the right side of the screen that extends from the top to the bottom and does not go away. \n\nI contacted customer service yesterday and they told me that, if I could send them the invoice for the phone purchase, we could go over potential options (they told me that based on purchase date, it was out of warranty). I was at work and didn't have this proof of purchase on me, but they said I could send them the invoice at any point in the next 24 hours. I went to the local AT&T store and retrieved the invoice for the phone, then sent it along in the support chat. \n\nAt this point, the person (or bot) I was chatting with had changed names. After sending the receipt, I was informed that my only options were to either mail it to them or take it to a UBreakIFix location that was out-of-state and inconvenient for travel. I asked why they had me retrieve the invoice, and got different answers from multiple reps, including a supervisor. I believe that, ultimately, it was not necessary.\n\nHas anyone else had to jump through hoops to have this issue fixed? \n\nI'm kind of annoyed that the onus of repair is put entirely on the customer when Google is aware of this problem, which was created on their end.

I have photos of the screen working absolutely fine. \n\nFrom my experience, I am convinced that Google’s authorized repair centers in India are engaging in unethical practices.

I have not seen even cheap Chinese Phones with Sub INR 10k swelling up suddenly within 2 years as with this shit Pixel 7. And now the Service Centre in Noida is trying to Scam me by saying perfectly working Display needs to be changed. \n\nBecause of this I have now lost trust in Google’s repair process.

    "selftext": "Hello friends and Pixel users. About a week ago, I updated my Pixel 8 Pro from Android 15 to Android 16. The thing is, on Android 15, the mobile networks worked perfectly. I had no problems whatsoever. After updating to Android 16, that's where the problems started. The signal icon automatically appears with an exclamation mark (!) and no signal at all. It's ONLY fixed by restarting, but it only works for 3-5 minutes before it goes back to the same thing. No signal, no data, NOTHING. What did you do to the modem in Android 16, Google? Is this a strategy to get me to switch to a new Pixel and then do the same thing? I've tried everything: factory reset, changing SIM cards, reinstalling the software, and nothing fixes it I've seen it on different forums, and it really is a real problem affecting 4 out of 10 Pixel 8 Pro users. It's truly outrageous that Google hasn't provided a real solution, knowing full well that thousands of Pixel 8 Pro users are experiencing the SAME problem after the update. The worst part is that my warranty expired about 6 months ago, so I'm the one who loses out. I'm sure that if Google doesn't release an update that fixes the modem issue, I'll never buy another Pixel phone again.",

    "selftext": "So for the past 24 hours I've been trying to understand why my Google AI Plan (the Gemini and 2tb plan) wasn't included with my purchase of the Pixel 9 Pro last year, as advertised. Just to be clear, I bought the phone in January when the promotion was still active, I received the offer, but when I went to redeem the offer apparently it didn't work correctly and instead it put me on a paid plan. I wasn't paying attention, which is totally my fault, and didn't notice I was getting charged $9.99 a month for the 2tb plan, instead. The customer service agents I spoke to told me there as an error with the offer, which is why it wasn't redeemed correctly. They are also telling me too bad, and that there is nothing I can do... So apparently a glitch in their system is my fault, and they are willing to lose a customer over it. I just don't understand how we got to this point. Its clear that the many customer service reps aren't given the authority to help me, and I get that, but they can't even elevate my case to someone that can help. I am soooooo understanding of how horrible it must be to work customer service and I deal with people like this every day for my job, I know it isn't their fault. But why is Google so comfortable with losing a customer over something so trivial? I've had Pixel's since day one, been a google customer since gmail came out, and have joined Insider programs to be a part of the community... Why do they think its ok to treat customers like this after admitting it wasn't my fault?",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis has been a wild ride. Today, **I finally received the official Google Camera update (v. 10.1.076.821848723.18) directly from the Play Store**.\n\nTo give you the full context:\n\n* **Oct 11th:** Google Support first told me the fix was in the (then unreleased) Oct 9th build **(10.1.076.816441313.17)**. I told them I'd test it when I received it.\n* **Oct 16th:** I experienced that bizarre \"[miracle fix](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)\" anomaly. I wrote to them again with proof, asking what was going on, and reiterated that I *still* hadn't received the update and that the manual APK *did not* work.\n* **Oct 17th:** Support replied, saying they were escalating this new 'miracle fix' info to the engineers.\n* **Oct 28th (Yesterday):** After 11 days of silence, I wrote to them again for an update. They replied, stating they were *also* still waiting for a follow-up from the engineers.\n* **Oct 29th (Today):** And then, this morning, the update finally, *officially* arrived.\n\nI immediately went to my testing spot, and unfortunately, I have to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n**The verdict: The main EIS stutter bug on the telephoto lens is 100% still there. It is NOT fixed.**\n\nYou can watch the full, new video evidence I just uploaded here: [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s)\n\n# What the Video Proves\n\nThe new test footage confirms the 5X Telephoto is still unusable (you can see the comparison with our benchmark, **OpenCamera**).\n\nIn addition to the obvious OIS/EIS conflict, I still **hypothesize that the root cause is a software limbo**: the telephoto's stabilization seems permanently stuck somewhere between the 'Standard' and 'Lock' modes. It tries to 'stick' to objects even when it shouldn't, which is what causes the 'jump' or 'stutter' when you pan. My [**new video**](https://youtu.be/3KvSd9F_97s?t=22) clearly demonstrates the broken toggle.\n\n# The (Only) Good News\n\nThe *only* positive thing is that the October updates (both this one and the last one) **unlocked the ProRes 50MP feature**. (A heads-up for those who didn't know!) This now enables **100x zoom** in 50MP mode, up from the old 30x limit, and the quality is noticeably better. This is honestly how it should have worked from the start, but it's a nice find.\n\n*(P.S. This new \"failed fix\" also doesn't explain the bizarre \"miracle fix\" I experienced on* ***October 16th****, which I captured on video here:* [***ProShot and PixeCamera***](https://imgur.com/a/QpBm8xW)*. That was a separate anomaly that disappeared after a reboot.)*\n\n# I Need Your Help: A Call for Data\n\nHere's where it gets confusing. I know some users, like u/Unbreakable2k8, [reported that the APK did fix the issue for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nojbce/comment/nl41b16/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This is why I need to ask the community for help so we can gather proper statistics.\n\n**If you have a Pixel Pro/Pro XL (10, 9, 8, 7, 6) and received the OFFICIAL 10.1.076.816441313.17** or **10.1.076.821848723.18 update:**\n\n1. **What phone do you have?**\n2. **Did you get the update from the Play Store?**\n3. **Is the EIS telephoto stutter fixed for YOU?**\n\nPlease let me know in the comments. I will be compiling all of my **7 new logs** from today's failed test, my new video evidence, AND a summary of our community findings into a new, massive report for Google.\n\n**We're not giving up. Thanks, everyone.🤝**",

But the reality is that ever since the Pixel 6+ Google has moved to capturing the normies market.  \n  \nTo the people complaining about the Pixel now, I'll say what I've said in other posts talking about the phone. If you're a hardcore enthusiast, the phone isn't meant for you and is largely aimed at everyone else, and that's FINE. Other phone brands exist, and if you want the best performance for games, or the best video filming options, you have brands that you can go to, and have a way better specs for that.  \n  \nBut what the Pixel loses in some features it easily wins in others, like software smarts, or camera performance, or display quality, or speaker quality, etc etc, the list goes on.   \n  \nTo top it all off, Pixel has had year over year growth which means Google's current strategy is working, on top of it's marketing strategy, at least here in the US.\n\nTo the hardcore enthusiast, I'll say it once more, this phone isn't meant for you unless you can put up with who this phone is aimed at, the normies, and taking market share from Samsung and Apple at least in here in America, where we barely get any smartphones from the Chinese Market where the competition is non-existent.\n\nNow the deserved criticism that Google should take is regarding the software bugs that can randomly pop-up, and their horrendous customer services outsource experience. \n\nOverall Pixel is a solid phone, especially once they moved past the initial problems they had with Tensor launch, and the 7 which largely are now in the past. If you were burned by those phones and went to a different brand, I don't blame you, but past experience doesn't equate to current lineup and offers, and it's evident in the past that all phone makers have also had issues, not just Google.\n\nThis is just one mans thoughts, I'd love to hear what you all have to offer as well.

    "selftext": "I’ve been on iOS for \\~15 years. I decided not to get the iPhone 17 Pro Max after feeling there wasn’t much real innovation over the last four years and jumped to a Pixel 10 Pro XL for the AI features. The phone feels legitimately powerful and I like a lot about it.\n\nOne thing is driving me nuts. When I try to swipe horizontally, a slight diagonal thumb swipe often turns into a vertical scroll. On iOS, the system seems to “get” my intent and direction-locks to horizontal. On Android, it feels like the UI commits to vertical too easily unless my swipe is perfectly straight.\n\nWhere I see it most  \n• Walmart cart screen: the horizontal suggestions under the cart love to scroll the page vertically instead of sliding sideways.  \n• Amazon product pages: the horizontal “Sponsored” product carousels often scroll the page vertically on small diagonals.  \n• Messenger apps: media carousels and horizontal chips regularly misinterpret diagonals.\n\nWhat I already tried  \n• Fully updated system and apps  \n• Tuned back-gesture edge sensitivity  \n• Turned on touch-sensitivity / screen-protector mode(Just checked it out although I have no screen protection on)  \n• Temporarily used 3-button nav while testing\n\nQuestions  \n• Do you see the same diagonal-to-vertical behavior on recent Pixels?  \n• Any hidden settings, flags, or launcher/gesture tweaks that improve horizontal direction-locking?  \n• If you moved from iOS, did this bother you at first and then fade as you adjusted your swipe angle?\n\nConstructive ask to Google/Android devs  \nPlease prioritize this. Bias the recognition toward horizontal when the initial movement suggests a sideways swipe, or give us a setting to prefer horizontal direction-lock. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is fantastic overall, but this one behavior makes you miss the “smooth and floating” feel that IOS has.",

In some further investigation I opened Pro Mode and I wonder if this is the reason--in pro mode, Shadows appears first on the Pixel 10 whereas Brightness appears first on the Pixel 9.

Sometimes it's only a little greenish tint, sometimes it renders my phone unusable because the screen looks like green static. Through Reddit, I discovered that a gentle squeeze on the bottom of the phone would (sometimes) fix the issue, albeit temporarily. I didn't really want to continue this practice and potentially damage the phone.\n\nTwo nights ago, it was flickering, but wouldn't go back with a gentle squeeze. I put it on its charger and in the morning, it was fine, no more green. However, now there is a neon vertical line off-center to the right side of the screen that extends from the top to the bottom and does not go away. \n\nI contacted customer service yesterday and they told me that, if I could send them the invoice for the phone purchase, we could go over potential options (they told me that based on purchase date, it was out of warranty). I was at work and didn't have this proof of purchase on me, but they said I could send them the invoice at any point in the next 24 hours. I went to the local AT&T store and retrieved the invoice for the phone, then sent it along in the support chat. \n\nAt this point, the person (or bot) I was chatting with had changed names. After sending the receipt, I was informed that my only options were to either mail it to them or take it to a UBreakIFix location that was out-of-state and inconvenient for travel. I asked why they had me retrieve the invoice, and got different answers from multiple reps, including a supervisor. I believe that, ultimately, it was not necessary.\n\nHas anyone else had to jump through hoops to have this issue fixed? \n\nI'm kind of annoyed that the onus of repair is put entirely on the customer when Google is aware of this problem, which was created on their end.

    "selftext": "I had sent my less than 2 years old Pixel 7 for so-called \"free repair\" due to screen popping out because of a swollen battery with RMA number GSR.4695-5627-8318. While contacting Google Support with enquiry number [6-4504000039517] I had sent photos of the phone with the Display working perfectly.\n\nAfter Google received the phone, I was informed that I would either have to pay INR 14,542 ($160 ) for a so‑called display issue or have the phone returned unrepaired. This was unreasonable because there was no display defect when I sent the phone, and the screen separation was entirely due to the swollen battery. I have photos of the screen working absolutely fine. \n\nFrom my experience, I am convinced that Google’s authorized repair centers in India are engaging in unethical practices. They are citing fake display issues to charge customers which is a pure Scam.\n\nFirst Google manufactures Substandard Product. I have not seen even cheap Chinese Phones with Sub INR 10k swelling up suddenly within 2 years as with this shit Pixel 7. And now the Service Centre in Noida is trying to Scam me by saying perfectly working Display needs to be changed. \n\nBecause of this I have now lost trust in Google’s repair process. What options do I have now? Has anyone else experienced the same?\n\nScreenshot showing working display while Chatting with Google Support Attached.",

No cross thread as I pulled it out and did it again on both 2 or 3 times to be certain.\n\nHas anyone else found that the thread depth isn't very deep on the top 2 screws for mounting?\n\nConsidering taking it down and quadruple checking but wanting to leave it.\n\nIts been 24 hours now, no movement so want to leave it on the wall but the anxiety in the back of my mind tells me otherwise. I fear ill keep going in circles and eventually ruin it myself.\n\nMake me feel better please haha.\n\n❤️",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion.

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

    "selftext": "I was a Galaxy user for about 10 years (starting with the S1 until the S7) and one thing that always drove me crazy was how my phones would slow down after a year or two. I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

    "selftext": "Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

I absolutely love it, i put it on the wall and its nicely up there.\n\nMy only concern is, the 2 top screws only screwed in a few turns before becoming tight. No cross thread as I pulled it out and did it again on both 2 or 3 times to be certain.\n\nHas anyone else found that the thread depth isn't very deep on the top 2 screws for mounting?\n\nConsidering taking it down and quadruple checking but wanting to leave it.\n\nIts been 24 hours now, no movement so want to leave it on the wall but the anxiety in the back of my mind tells me otherwise. I fear ill keep going in circles and eventually ruin it myself.\n\nMake me feel better please haha.\n\n❤️",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "Hi, i recently upgraded my phone to an S25 Ultra, and so I had to connect my Galxy Watch Active to a new phone. However when I did this, I found that I could no longer download any apps onto the watch. Whenever I go into the Galaxy Store on the watch, it just doesn't display any app results whatsoever- I click the recommended tab, 'no results'. I search for a specific app, 'no results'. Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed? If anyone has the solution to this problem it would be appreciated. \n\nP.s. sorry the screenshots are in Polish, but it just essentially says 'no results' as I stated above.",

But now that I'm four weeks out I'm seeing further improvement.\n\nInitially after 24 hours my charge would drop to under 20% (starting at 90%).  At a week it would be between 30 and 40%.  Now four weeks out I'm above 50%.  Charging times have been correspondingly reduced.  The only change I can think of is being totally dissatisfied with Samsung Health exporting data I've limited what it exports, but it's still exporting heart rate 24/7, and I think that gets sent to the phone even without using Samsung Health at all.\n\nHave others notice similar significant changes in battery drain?\n\nEdit:  I should have knocked wood after posting. Today it was down to 18% which hasn't happened since the first week.  No unusual uses yesterday.",

It felt like the watch was paired with my phone, but not actually connected. After I reset the watch, I successfully paired it with my phone again, but the message “Check your phone to complete setup” keeps lingering. When I try to add the device in the Galaxy Wearable app, it’s successfully detected and added, but the connection process takes an indefinitely long time, and eventually, the message “Couldn’t connect to your watch” appears. Interestingly, the Bluetooth connection between the phone and the watch gets disconnected automatically afterwards. I have no idea what to do next.   \n  \nHas anyone encountered something similar? If so, how did you solve it? Honestly, I’m getting pretty desperate…",

    "selftext": "So...... my phone (S21 Ultra) took a dive in a swimming pool.   I caught it before it hit bottom, immediately turned it off, and hung it ports down above a fan (I read that it will dry better in open air than in rice), but it's not looking good.   It may have been water resistant enough to survive a quick dunk when it was new, but the years apparently degraded that.   It's been hanging above the fan for 5 days and counting, and this morning it still wouldn't turn on, and when I plug it in it shows the charging icon for about 3 seconds, then nothing.\n\nSo why am I telling you this in r/GalaxyWatch ?    Because I got an S25 Ultra to replace it, but I had to reset my GW3 to connect it to the S25 Ultra, and I lost my favorite watchface (pay no attention to the 8% battery.... I stole someone else's picture of the watchface.)\n\nI'd thought a little about upgrading the GW3, but it's about 32nd on the list, since the GW3 still does everything I want it to do.   With support for Tizen ending, I may need to move it up on my list?\n\nSo I'm wondering if the Bluestealth watchface (or something very like it) is available for newer Galaxy watches?\n\nI still have my OG Galaxy Watch in a drawer, I haven't reset it, and it still has the Bluestealth watchface.   Is there any way to recover the watchface from the OG GW to the GW3 to at least tide me over until I decide to upgrade to a newer watch?",

It turns out that there is a maximum number of alarms you can have in your Alarm app. I deleted all my alarms and tried setting a new one again, and it worked without any errors.\n\nI discovered this because when I attempted to set an alarm using Bixby, it informed me that I had reached the maximum number of alarms. However, when using Gemini, it simply gives an \"UNKNOWN ERROR\" message, even though it behaves as if the alarm was set. If you're not checking the watch display after asking Gemini, you might not even realize there's been an error.\n\nThanks to everyone who tried to help me earlier!",

My current watch is a simple FitBit Versa 3 (so any Galaxy watch will be an upgrade lol).\n\n- I mainly wish to use the watch as an extension of my phone (texting, calling, music control, etc) with my phone nearby, so the LTE function won't be a necessity.\n\n- The main secondary purpose I need my watch for is fitness tracking: Tracking heart rate, steps, calories, distance, etc.\n\nI am on the fence right now. I have found a 47mm Galaxy 6 Classic for quite a good deal ($109 for the bluetooth OR LTE model), and that is the model I'm leaning towards. But before I buy, I want to know if paying an extra $100-$150 for the Galaxy 7 would be worth it for any newer specs or features that it has. \n\nI won't be using my watch as much for temperature tracking and GPS purposes (beyond tracking running/biking distance which I can also have my phone on me for). \n\nI also dont plan to download a ton of apps (mainly the defaults, a few interchangable watch faces, timer, calorie tracking, metronome, Spotify control, and possibly 1 or 2 games) so I'm unsure of how much of an impact the 16GB to 32GB difference would make on my satisfaction with either one. \n\nPlease, any insight, advice, and experience would be greatly appreciated!

    "selftext": "Hello all, im just wondering if anyone has had this experience since the OneUI 8 update. Now, i will clarify a few things:\n\n1. I use the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024)\n2. I've had the update for about 2-3 months\n\nI recently started running again, I started taking it seriously back in June (pre-update). When I was running then, I would do as I still do today; start the 'Running' exercise on Samsung Health (on the watch) and crack on. The activity face would report my live pace and report the split every km - if I ran at a  6:00/km then the split readout wouldn't report a 6:00/km pace.\n\nHowever, since the last major update (OneUI 8) on the watch, the live pace has been way off. This is my current experience: I start the 'Running' activity I crack on and check the live pace its reading 6:30. When I hit the first split and the readout occurs, its reading ~30s faster such as 'lap pace, 5:57/km' - and this is the split that is recorded after I finish the activity. So what has happened to the live readings? It's been like this for months, at this point, i am just used to it and just use the incorrect live pace, knowing what it is roughly and just read the split readout for the correct information. Has anyone else experienced this, from OneUI 7 > OneUI 8? I don't know if this is Watch Ultra specific issue or across the product range.\n\nTLDR: Live running pace used to be relatively accurate, since One UI 8 update, the live pace is reported as a much slower pace than what the actual pace is.",

The other 2 moderators have been inactive for a few months, so I’ve taken over the role as top moderator for the community. I’ve been doing some spring cleaning and updates, with the biggest changes being:\n\n\n\n* The rules list is much clearer and more detailed\n* The rule on Watch Face Posts is now:\n   * Pictures of real watches are allowed, but advertisements are not.\n   * See the included image as an example\n\n\n\nSome other smaller changes:\n\n\n\n* More “Similar Communities” subreddits are on the sidebar\n* Flairs have been cleaned up slightly and might be combined in the future.\n* The backlog of unprocessed rule violation reports has been actioned and cleared\n   * If your post or comment was accidentally removed, let me know!\n* A comment sticky has been created clarifying the new Watch Face Post rule\n\n\n\nWe will be doing a call for moderators in the future. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\nDo you have any feedback or requests you’d like to share about the state of the subreddit? Please let me know!\n\n",

However when I did this, I found that I could no longer download any apps onto the watch. Whenever I go into the Galaxy Store on the watch, it just doesn't display any app results whatsoever- I click the recommended tab, 'no results'. I search for a specific app, 'no results'. Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed? If anyone has the solution to this problem it would be appreciated. \n\nP.s. sorry the screenshots are in Polish, but it just essentially says 'no results' as I stated above.",

Now four weeks out I'm above 50%.  Charging times have been correspondingly reduced.  The only change I can think of is being totally dissatisfied with Samsung Health exporting data I've limited what it exports, but it's still exporting heart rate 24/7, and I think that gets sent to the phone even without using Samsung Health at all.\n\nHave others notice similar significant changes in battery drain?\n\nEdit:  I should have knocked wood after posting. Today it was down to 18% which hasn't happened since the first week.  No unusual uses yesterday.",

I've tried restarting both phone and watch. Even deleted the app. I've included images of what I'm seeing. I also accidentally removed permission on my one plus 13 phone for the Galaxy wearable app for device app and notification, but I can't find any way to give it permission back. Any help is appreciated.",

Whenever I go into the Galaxy Store on the watch, it just doesn't display any app results whatsoever- I click the recommended tab, 'no results'. I search for a specific app, 'no results'. Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed? If anyone has the solution to this problem it would be appreciated. \n\nP.s. sorry the screenshots are in Polish, but it just essentially says 'no results' as I stated above.",

Now four weeks out I'm above 50%.  Charging times have been correspondingly reduced.  The only change I can think of is being totally dissatisfied with Samsung Health exporting data I've limited what it exports, but it's still exporting heart rate 24/7, and I think that gets sent to the phone even without using Samsung Health at all.\n\nHave others notice similar significant changes in battery drain?\n\nEdit:  I should have knocked wood after posting. Today it was down to 18% which hasn't happened since the first week.  No unusual uses yesterday.",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI have an MSI GF65 Thin 10UE laptop, and I have a problem with it, sometimes it just crashes when listening to music, the screen locks, keyboard is unresponsive, brightness controls are unresponsive, and the audio sounds like when you are playing audio and your computer BSODs, except there is no screen of death, sometimes it will stay like this and then the screen will turn off completely, audio still glitches, this has happened to me specifically while using the headphone jack, though it has happened before and even with no music. I have no idea what to do anymore, windows event logger always shows a crash with the reason of the laptop being shut down abruptly, though one time a huge crash file generated taking up the last 11gb of storage I had, deleted because it was invalid.\n\nI must mention one time the music stopped sounding like a BSOD and it started playing until the end of the song, computer completely unresponsive, then when the song ended, nothing else played even though the next song should have played.\n\nOS: Windows 11\nMusic player: foobar2000, local library always, playlist has my entire music library so it should skip to the next even though it didn’t that one time.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what could be causing this? If more details are needed they will be given. Seems like a software issue but i have no way of proving it with no error showing the culprit.",

Quick note: although I've been in the PC sphere for quite some time, I'm still not really knowledgeable on most of this stuff (I found out about CPU generations only a week or two ago). I mostly want a laptop that has reasonable price and good enough specs that don't eat up much of the battery (which is why I kinda avoided discrete GPUs and high Gz models, especially considering that this stuff is kinda out of my field in general)\n\nIn general this laptop's specs seem good enough for me, but the fact that there's barely any reviews on it as of now somewhat worries me. I'm not dead-set on buying this specific one, but so far it's been the only one that actually has satisfying flavour, at least in theory. If there's anyone who's already bought the laptop and's been using it for some time already, is it good or should I look for different options?",

    "selftext": "Hello guys. I installed ubuntu 25.04 recently and stupidly decided to update to the most recent kernel version which was 6.17 at the time using the command sudo-apt-repository ppa:cappelikan/ppa to download the Main Kernel tool. I then realized the kernel was unsigned opposed to the one installed by default, which is signed. I then decided to remove the kernel and ran into many issues and ended up reinstalling Ubuntu to the newest version 25.10. Now my laptop is making this weird buzzing sound sporadically and honestly I'm not even sure if it did this before because I always wear headphones but I became paranoid since running issues with the kernel due to hardware malfunction and started noticing this sound. Does anyone know what it may be? Thank you in advanced.\n\nEspecifications:\nASUS TUF A16 Ryzen 7 7735HS with 16GB DDR5 Memory\nRadeon RX7700s\n512 GB PCle SSD",

    "selftext": "So I currently have a Lenovo Yoga 7i pretty the much the same specs as the 9i I would just appreciate the OLED screen and 2-in-1 capabilities. My plan was to originally return the 7i and pay the extra $100 for the OLED screen, and 2 in 1 capabilities. But when looking again, I found this HP for even cheaper with seemingly better specs. The 2tb SSD seems pretty sweet plus a slightly more powerful processor. What I'm worried about tho is I hear a lot of talk of HP's software and battery life as well as the build quality not being as good as the Lenovo's, so im wondering how true this is, and if it would be worth it to get the HP for the cheaper price, the Ultra 9, and the extra tb of storage. If it matters im currently in high and planning to use the laptop for an IT degree throughout college. Idk if this is correct or not but I think the HP's have more upgradeability as well? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m793hhkm83yf1.png?width=2571&format=png&auto=webp&s=92a036802fc9fab1ad1c4a15553ddafaee6532f4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fkn1axn83yf1.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&s=95310f5d6b61cc08a71efb02207b0cb8f0a1488d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjzj0lyo83yf1.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=19e472d4a341c1c4337d4bb16c3f59b56ab8b32b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj3bnlzp83yf1.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a7f3743189b24c803ded5f7df004fcd34b68cdc\n\n",

Some totes finally have laptop sleeves, but the *functionality* is still missing  the straps dig into your shoulders, and carrying it all day feels like lifting weights. Why are women’s bags designed only for aesthetics or “flex” and not actual *comfort* or *usage*?\n\nAnd affordable options are even worse.

I have a PC at home running windows and an ubuntu server that I can ssh into and code on there instead of on my macbook. This macbook has fanstatic battery life, basically it can sustain for multiple days because I only use it for Uni and not at home\n\nHowever lately I have been running into multiple obstacles where I need to use enterprise program (power designer, powerBI, or some processes that just run out of the box on windows but require additional application on mac like android transfer). So currently I'm looking for an alternative for this macbook. Also yes I know I can setup moonlight to my home pc and probably use my ubuntu server to wake up the pc but it's not a reliable thing to do especially when it involves work, also parallel is too expensive and VM is just too slow since it's a base model\n\nThe only requirement would be great battery life and running windows with 16gb or more RAM (preferably x86 since I heard that many programs doesn't support arm processor). I don't really care about the screen so it dont need to be OLED or something like that but if they do have them It's a plus. Budget is 1K Euro, could be new or second hand\n\nAppreciate any recommendation!",

He mentioned a different one maybe an open box item. He told him the same employee told me on Sunday that it wouldn’t have a warranty of open box. He said that was incorrect. Since I needed a laptop then he found one in store that was open box and we had to pay 160 more. Wasnt happy to pay more but thats ok. The manager was super nice during the entire process. \n\nWhen I got the new laptop home and powered it on………IT still BELONGED to someone else and wasn't wiped. \n\nI sent the lady a message on FB so she can contact the store. Her personal information was given to someone else. I personally would wipe it myself before returning it.  \n\nHow can I wipe this laptop myself, when I am trying traditional ways and keeps saying there is an error. \n\n ",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI have an MSI GF65 Thin 10UE laptop, and I have a problem with it, sometimes it just crashes when listening to music, the screen locks, keyboard is unresponsive, brightness controls are unresponsive, and the audio sounds like when you are playing audio and your computer BSODs, except there is no screen of death, sometimes it will stay like this and then the screen will turn off completely, audio still glitches, this has happened to me specifically while using the headphone jack, though it has happened before and even with no music. I have no idea what to do anymore, windows event logger always shows a crash with the reason of the laptop being shut down abruptly, though one time a huge crash file generated taking up the last 11gb of storage I had, deleted because it was invalid.\n\nI must mention one time the music stopped sounding like a BSOD and it started playing until the end of the song, computer completely unresponsive, then when the song ended, nothing else played even though the next song should have played.\n\nOS: Windows 11\nMusic player: foobar2000, local library always, playlist has my entire music library so it should skip to the next even though it didn’t that one time.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what could be causing this? If more details are needed they will be given. Seems like a software issue but i have no way of proving it with no error showing the culprit.",

I mostly want a laptop that has reasonable price and good enough specs that don't eat up much of the battery (which is why I kinda avoided discrete GPUs and high Gz models, especially considering that this stuff is kinda out of my field in general)\n\nIn general this laptop's specs seem good enough for me, but the fact that there's barely any reviews on it as of now somewhat worries me. I'm not dead-set on buying this specific one, but so far it's been the only one that actually has satisfying flavour, at least in theory. If there's anyone who's already bought the laptop and's been using it for some time already, is it good or should I look for different options?",

    "selftext": "First family laptop, and my first restoration project. Its a Dell Inspiron 6400, originally had an Intel Core Duo T2500 (32 bit), GMA 950, 512 MB of DDR2, and a 100GB 5200RPM HDD. The original screen actually isn't all too bad (for my standards at least) with a 1200×800 resolution and *okay* viewing angles and colors.\n\nI left it torn apart for a year, though I finally got around to upgrading it and cleaning it thoroughly. The cleaning proces was absolutely disgusting, with gunk in every single crevice.\n\nThe new specs include an Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 (64 bit), 2 GB of DDR2, the same horrible GMA 950, and a Teamgroup CX2 256 GB SATA SSD. It feels great with a fresh install of Vista Ultimate 64 bit and Aero enabled, though web browsing is an absolute pain. I tried to opt with Linux first, but I couldn't use GNOME (my favorite DE) without it being so slow, so I ended up using Vista instead.\n\nSome remarks:\n\n-This feels great to type on when I'm in class with an outlet right beside me. The battery only lasts a maximum of 1 hour, so I have to charge basically all of the time.\n-I use Google Classroom and Google Docs often, and this laptop can handle those things fine. However, literally anything more than Reddit and 5 tabs will slow everything down to an unusable mess.\n-I will test Photoshop CS2 when I find a proper copy of it, since it meets the system requirements.",

I have no idea what to do anymore, windows event logger always shows a crash with the reason of the laptop being shut down abruptly, though one time a huge crash file generated taking up the last 11gb of storage I had, deleted because it was invalid.\n\nI must mention one time the music stopped sounding like a BSOD and it started playing until the end of the song, computer completely unresponsive, then when the song ended, nothing else played even though the next song should have played.\n\nOS: Windows 11\nMusic player: foobar2000, local library always, playlist has my entire music library so it should skip to the next even though it didn’t that one time.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what could be causing this? If more details are needed they will be given. Seems like a software issue but i have no way of proving it with no error showing the culprit.",

I already purchased some Silicon Power DDR5 32GB (https://amzn.eu/d/5FlhP1h) because it was cheap at the time and the reviews on Amazon were 4.6 with 1,900 reviews. I only realised after purchasing when filtering reviews for that skew the reviews are really bad for compatibility and other issues, so I'll likely to return this. \n\nI have a budget of £150 and I'm trying to decide between these two which have the same price:\n\nTeamGroup Delta RGB 32GB (2X16GB) DDR5 PC5-44800C30 6000MHz Dual Channel Kit - Black (FF3D532G6000HC30DC01)\n\nVs\n\nCORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 6000MHz CMT32GX5M2B6000C30\n\nIt's been a while since I've built a pc but I've never heard of TeamGroup although they seem quite well regarded with reviews. The website listing only mentions XMP but according to several sources it supports EXPO as well and is listed on my motherboards compatible list. \n\nSaying that the corsair definitely looks like a more premium kit for the same money. My only concern is that it's only XMP (although I've heard you can still use A-XMP on newer Bios to make it work) and it isn't listed on my motherboards compatible list. \n\nWould it be foolish to buy the corsair kit? \n\nThanks Again",

When I did that, there was a tiny spark, a pop, and everything flickered and shut down, with what I believe was one of the MOSFETs giving off a tiny bit of smoke.\n\nNow I know the mobo is definitely damaged and I'm going to replace it, but right now my question is should I replace the power supply as well? I did the paperclip test and the fan turned on, but I'm afraid to use the same power supply and fry the new mobo as well. I've done a lot of googling on this with no clear answer so I figured I'd pitch it to the experts here. Happy to answer any questions and deserve the sighs at the rookie mistake I've made.

That's OK, its been with me for years, and owes me nothing.  However, when I look into the upgrade paths, it seems DDR5 memory is in my immediate future.  \n\nI have spent quite a bit of time researching, scrolling and parsing data, but I can't seem to find recent information with regards to DDR5 speeds when it comes to high capacity.  My current rig utilizes 128GB of DDR4 ram, and I tend to use it all.  I spend a lot of time in Solidworks and other RAM intensive applications, so have become quite accustomed to having this amount of resources available.  When I looked into this previously (admittedly a few years ago) I distinctly remember that high volumes of DDR5 ram were ill advised due to speed loss.  I'm pretty sure that had to do with quad channel dimms, but cant find any confirmation to that fact.\n\nTo boil the issue/question down; Is it currently possible to achieve 128GB at respectful speeds?\n\nAppreciate you guys!",

    "selftext": "I built a PC almost 10 years ago and it worked fine until the power supply failed, at that point I just built another one since it had needed upgrading anyway.  \n\nThe new one didn't even last two years without issues, the power supply, motherboard, and 5 of the 6 drives I installed were all failing, and I gave up on it once the m.2 drive with the operating system died.  I ordered parts to build a new PC, and I assembled it all and it won't even power on.  I think either I made a mistake that I can't see or the motherboard is bad.  \n\nI used to think that building a computer was better because you could use all good quality parts rather than just stuff that sounded good in the description then everything else cheap, but it seems like it's all junk wherever you buy it now.  Maybe it's just better to get the cheapest thing that will work and replace it every couple years? Its not enough money that it will have any significant negative effect on my life but I'm definitely annoyed to have like $3k worth of e waste that I thought I would be able to use a lot longer (or at all).",

    "title": "First time builder and a few questions",
    "selftext": "Hi All!\n\nI'm a first time builder and I was hoping to get some insight on about my potential build. I've always had machines specced for me from work but this time I'm out on my own.\n\nPC goals: 4k 120hz gaming, ML development \n\nBudget: $3500 USD absolute max. The less the better.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. I'm trying to decide between a 9800X3D and a 9950X3D. Right now I'm learning towards the 9800X3D because my thought is that for both my use cases I SHOULD technically be GPU bottlenecked. Do you guys think this is the correct conclusion? I can use the money saved to increase the GPU budget.\n\n2. I'm trying to decide between a 5080 and a 5090. I have a spare 3080 ti lying around but based on my research this won't be able to hit 4k@120fps on a lot of modern games. For future proofing and for current gen gaming would a 5080 be sufficient? Based on research some games need to rely on DLSS with the 5080 to hit 120fps. The ML workloads will definitely be improved with the 5090s additional VRAM.\n\n3. Have I sufficiently specced all the components out here? Do you guys/gals see anything that standouts as odd choices? Are there any improvements or optimizations for the part selections you think could be made?\n\n4. I'm planning on using the fractal design north xl case without the glass panel and I don't care about rgb so I've chosen non rgb versions of commonly recommended components. Just want to double check that I've still chosen great components.\n\n5. I also want to build a home server running proxmox for media streaming, file serving, and running some vms. My thoughts are that this MUST be a separate machine for perf reasons. Is there any path to adding that use case to the current spec? I could bump the RAM to 128GB and the chip to the 9950X3D (more cores for vms and containers). Is it even possible to get get 4k@120fps on modern games with a Windows vm and GPU passthrough? Based on my research I think it's a no. I'd be ok to increase the budget if required to pursue this path.\n\nCurrent part list I've made:\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/rmrhC8)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 4.7 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fPyH99/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-47-ghz-8-core-processor-100-1000001084wof) | $459.98 @ B&H \n**CPU Cooler** | [ARCTIC Liquid Freezer III Pro 360 77 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/v2kqqs/arctic-liquid-freezer-iii-pro-360-77-cfm-liquid-cpu-cooler-acfre00180a) | $89.99 @ Amazon \n**Motherboard** | [MSI MAG B850 TOMAHAWK MAX WIFI ATX AM5 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/vjpD4D/msi-mag-b850-tomahawk-max-wifi-atx-am5-motherboard-mag-b850-tomahawk-max-wifi) | $209.99 @ Amazon \n**Memory** | [Crucial Pro Overclocking 64 GB (2 x 32 GB) DDR5-6400 CL40 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/9RVfrH/crucial-pro-overclocking-64-gb-2-x-32-gb-ddr5-6400-cl40-memory-cp2k32g64c40u5b) | $289.99 @ Amazon \n**Storage** | [Samsung 990 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/34ytt6/samsung-990-pro-2-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-mz-v9p2t0bw) | $174.99 @ Newegg \n**Video Card** | [NVIDIA Founders Edition GeForce RTX 5080 16 GB Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/87WmP6/nvidia-founders-edition-geforce-rtx-5080-16-gb-video-card-900-1g144-2545-000) |-\n**Case** | [\\*Fractal Design North XL ATX Full Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Gd26Mp/fractal-design-north-xl-atx-full-tower-case-fd-c-nor1x-02) | $194.99 @ B&H \n**Power Supply** | [Lian Li EDGE 1000 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ZCHqqs/lian-li-edge-1000-w-80-platinum-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-eg1000) | $161.50 @ Amazon \n**Case Fan** | [Noctua A14 PWM chromax.black.swap 82.52 CFM 140 mm Fan](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/sWM323/noctua-nf-a14-pwm-chromaxblackswap-825-cfm-140mm-fan-nf-a14-pwm-chromaxblackswap) | $28.95 @ Amazon \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **$1610.38**\n | \\*Lowest price parts chosen from parametric criteria |\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-10-29 17:37 EDT-0400 |y",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I am building a rig for my son for Christmas and planning on some upgrades to my rig as I built it in 2019 and it is definitely starting to show its age. \n\nMy current and only PC specs are:\n\nRyzen 5 3600 \n\nAsus ROG Strix B450F\n\n12GB DDR4 2400MT/S BALLISTIX SPORT DDR4 (3 sticks, one died a while back so down from 16GB)\n\n5700XT\n\nSamsung 970 Evo 500GB NVME\n\nGeneric 256GB NVME\n\n256GB SATA SSD\n\nCorsair iCUE 220T Case (2 dead fans, missing top and front dust covers (dog got ahold of them during a cleaning))\n\nLG 24 inch 144hz 1ms freesync VA panel 1080p\n\n\nI am playing The Last of Us Part II and Battlefield 6, and I'm experiencing some severe performance issues with my current rig. I have already ordered a 16 GB (2x8GB) kit of 3200 memory for the current rig. I understand that with this generation of Ryzen chips, the faster the RAM, the better, and I'm aware that the current three-stick config is costing me a ton of performance. \n\n\nI stepped away from gaming in general for quite a while due to real life becoming busy, but things are calming back down, and I have a good job, so I figured now was the time to upgrade. Enter my son, who is 6 going on 7, and loves to game. He has a PS4 and a Switch Lite already, and those are fine for Fortnite and Roblox, but he is getting to the age where he wants to play some more demanding stuff. My plan is to secure a solid upgrade for my current rig and recycle most of the old parts into a rig for him to play on. My current CPU and GPU would be fine for a few more years for the stuff he likes to play, and will have passable performance on more demanding stuff, at least good enough for a child. \n\nNow, my current rig was the first computer I built using entirely new parts, and I thought I'd once again use that strategy here, but as im sure you're all aware, the second-hand PC market has absolutely lost its mind. \n\nI was able to find one deal for a 5800x3d, Asrock Mobo, 64 GB DDR4 Crucial Pro DDR4, and a 1 TB NVMe SSD for $320. My plans are to cobble together two systems as follows: \n\n[Dad's 5800x3D System](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VFdwxg)\n\nwith \n\n[Kid's New-to-him system](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/RykyGJ)\n\nBoth of those parts lists reflect what I already own and the prices I would be paying for those builds. \n\nPart of me is nagging to go ahead and build a 9600x system and to get myself on the am5 platform. I have been poring over benchmarks and specs for 1080p and possible 1440p ultrawide gaming later, it appears the 9600x and 5800x3D are just about even in most things. I have put together an AM5 parts list based on the 9600x, [Here.](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/KTJ2XR) That option is more expensive, but leaves me the upgrade path of AM5. But if all things are considered, I'd much rather have similar performance with last year's hardware; I am not precious about having the newest thing. \n\nPlease, all input is welcome. I have been out of this space for a few years, and things move very fast.",

    "selftext": "This will probably come down to personal preference, but I wanted some thoughts on what I should do.\n\nI currently have an EVGA 3080 Ti. It has mostly done what I needed it to do. The only real time I’ve noticed its limitations is in Cyberpunk with the settings cranked. Most other games it has performed quite well. I have a 4k 144hz monitor (Gigabyte M32U) and would like to actually get close to fully utilizing it.\n\nAs I’m sure you all saw, Best Buy had a ton of 5080 FE cards available the other day so I snagged one. Debating if I’ll actually pick it up when it arrives in store or if I’ll cancel the order.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n* My 3080 Ti currently has some value on the resale market. I never overclocked it and I have the box, etc. The longer I wait the less I’ll recoup. I also bought the warranty EVGA sold, but I have no idea if they’re even still capable of honoring it.\n* I could wait for the Supers which are rumored to be coming out in a few months. My guess is these will be hard to find for a while and I’m looking at next summer/fall to get my hands on one. Then it becomes, “do I wait for the 6,000 series?” \n* I could easily forgo buying this card and ride out my 3080 ti for another 2-3 years. Its value will be depleted at that point, but I also didn’t drop $1,000 on a new card over those 2-3 years either.\n* I’m not fully confident in how big of an upgrade this card is. Every post I see about the topic had a chorus of people saying it’s a big upgrade while others are like, “those benchmarks are BS, it’s actually minor improvements. Hard pass!”\n\nI’m happy either way. Just curious if anyone has a solid argument for either choice that could push me in one direction.",

I can't believe it's been so long since I built this system but it's finally time to start shopping for a new rig. \nMy current setup is said strix 1080ti, with an 8700K running at 5.2GHz. so far it has taken everything I've thrown at it and had provided a playable 1440p experience at least on moderate  settings at a decent refresh rate. But now that the driver support is over I'm going to pick up a new card soon. \n\nI obviously try to get something that will last me they the coming generations and although I can't justify a 5090, I'm looking at a 5070ti or possibly a 5080 as all of my screens are Gsync 1440p and I don't see myself upgrading those for some time. \n\nAs for CPU this is where my question lies. I have yet to do much research and have no clear decision (I am up for suggestions but looking at AMD for a change but may wait for the next Gen) but I am wondering if I just toss this new GPU on my ancient board if this thing is going to have any sort of improvement or will the bottleneck be so bad that I sould just bite the bullet and do everything at once. I can't really find any benchmarks or comparisons that take into account that this processor has a significant overclock on it so I am seeking the opinions of the community members.\n\nTLDR: will my OC'd 8700K be able to push a modern GPU such as a 5070ti in 1440p gaming (temporarily) or am I better off waiting until I can afford to buy the new board, chip and RAM all at once?",

    "title": "Basic Win 11 PC, would I regret picking a Ryzen 3000 instead of a 5000 (or AM5)? PSU and mainboard recommendations also welcome.",
    "selftext": "My mum's PC is due an upgrade because Win 10 support end and no Secure Boot and TPM, and since I currently still use both my home server and main PC neither of which is due for an upgrade, I don't have anything to 'pass on' this time around. So when I fly over for the holidays I'm going to build a new one, and before that I'll place an order so all the components are definitely already there before I am.\n\nIf I'm just generally stupid trying to build an AM4 box, let me know. AM5 is ofc also a (more expensive) option.\n\n# CPU/platform choice\n\nI didn't really pay attention between my Intel 6700K and my Ryzen 7900X, so I have no idea which functionality, memory compatibility, stability, and performance differences there are between the 3000 and 5000 series of Ryzen. From what I gather, anything 3000 and up will have everything Windows 11 officially demands and \"should work\", but are there any quirks that I should be aware of?\n\nThe main goal is that this thing makes no trouble. Tech support over WhatsApp from 1000km away is troublesome, so being rock solid is the number one criterium.\n\nPriority 2 would be the included cooler being quiet (but I'm fine getting a non-boxed CPU and extra cooler if the 3000/5000 gen packaged ones were bad).\n\nUse case is the typical no affection for tech, older generation things - basically Google Chrome, more Google Chrome, even more Google Chrome, and the occasional Word document (I gotta get her onto Google Docs...). So unless performance is noticeably crap in Windows 11 on a 3000 series it doesn't matter much.\n\nA maybe strong criterium would be booting from NVME M.2 without faffing around. Being more snappy than a SATA SSD to boot and open Chrome would be nice for her. Any difference there in eg direct-to-CPU M.2 PCIe lane count between 3000 and 5000?\n\n3000 series CPUs start at around 50, 5000 series around 100, and 7000 or newer around 150. I have a spare 2x16GB DDR5 kit so could skip buying memory if I build an AM5 system, but the price diff between a 3000 and a 7000 already pays for 2x16GB DDR4 and mainboards are also more expensive. So all are viable, but she'd be happier with a cheaper CPU and a nice restaurant visit than a fancier CPU and a microwave dinner. Or an external USB DVD drive for backed up photos and stuff (I believe the old PC still has an IDE optical drive, so that one will probably not be reuseable, I don't remember the exact drive but it is *beige*\\-old :D). But if 3000 is a bad choice and I bring my own memory, 7000 might actually end up being cheaper.\n\n# PSU wattage\n\nAlso would appreciate a PSU wattage recommendation (I could transplant the Geforce IIRC 460 or 470 from the previous hand-me-down into the new PC, but the integrated graphics will do just fine and cut down on the noise).\n\n# Mainboard recommendations\n\nEven if it is just something general eg which of the big brands (MSI, ASUS, Gigabyte, Asrock, ...) was good or crap for which chipsets. And which chipset series to avoid, which are fine. Definitely don't want anything that has a fan on it.\n\nThank you very much!",

    "selftext": "Hello guys Ive got a problem that I cant resolve myself. \n\nI have 7 yrs old pc custom build. Made it myself. I will try to describe all what happened. \n\nMy specs:\nCPU- Intel i7 8700\nGPU- MSI GTX 1080 Armor 8G GC\nMB- MSI B360M Mortar\nRAM- 2x Corsair 16GB DDR4 666MHZ CL16 Vengeance LPX\nPSU- Seasonic Focus Plus 650 Gold\nFan for CPU- Noctua NH-U14S\nOther fans in pc- 4x Noctua ( not noted which ones )\n\n\nFirst four years I was using it for gaming after that I am using it mainly for 3D modeling, visualizations etc. Plus ocasional gaming. ( I am an architect ) So its on heavy use daily. \n\n\n\nPart 1\n\nIt all started after installing update of windows 10 a month ago. I have conected the big two reproductors with basses around pc or a headset with microphone through Jack. Problem was that these two devices went invisible and not connected so I did not get any sound from pc and my system inly registered Nvidia high definition Audio from monitor ( I dont have reproductors in Monitor so still no sound ). \n\nMy fix was that I clean reinstall windows 10, updated nothing happened. Installed up to date drivers RealtekR + Nvidia drivers. Nothing happened. ( btw it was pretty hard to install RealtekR driver dunno why it most of the time froze or did not install at all ). After two days of doing software updates it magically started to recognize my devices such as Headset and Reproductors. What fixed it? Its mystery. Propability was that I reversed old update Win10 and that fixed it. \n\n\nPart 2\n\nAfter few weeks everytime I open an app, software or browser my sound from Volume mixer resets itself to default 50%. So I must everytime lower or upper the sound manually.\n\nThen when I tried to restart or turn off the computer it cant shut down itself. Everything turned off, monitor, signal, leds but I heard fans going very very silent. And again my computer did not recognize the sound from Headset or Reproductors. \n\nI made steps from Part 1 and it went again to normal. Okay I take that and continued my yourney on my good old sweet computer. \n\n\nPart 3 \n\nThis part started to bothering me and frustating me. Computer started losing HDMI signal, but I heard the music or software sounds but no image from monitor. And fans on GPU started venting like crazy! Helicopter vruuum! \n\nI made steps from Part 1, did not help. Constantly every 10-15minutes hdmi signal lost, heard sounds, no image and fans venting on GPU crazy. \n\nI teared apart, cleaned whole pc from dust ( I clean in like every half year with compressed air and Isoprohyl so my pc is not a mess ), cleaned pins with Isoprophyl, build everyhing back together. It helped and I was not having problem for two weeks.\n\nAfter that new day and same problem! Started googling problems what it could be. PSU, GPU probably. Like my GPU is not getting power or something like that. I tried good old simple method, changing a HDMI cable with a new one and changing the outlet in wall and changing extension lead with brand new. \n\nThis solved my problem for few days and today the HDMI lost signal and fans on GPU rev on max speed again.. I only turned on a computer! \nNo heavy use no opened single software! \n\nIn this phase I one time get a purple image on monitor or whole white image with beeping sounds. \n\nThe problem ocurs like one/two times per day with new cables. But it is temporarily fix until I get again same problem. \n\n\nThings I tried:\nreinstalling fresh windows 10\nBios update\nBios reset\nNew cables, hdmi, psu cable, cable that powers my GPU inside pc\nUpdated drivers- graphic nvidia, sound realtek, chipset drivers\nCleaned pc from dust, with copressed air and Isoprohyl\nThermal paste in CPU is new, year old\nThermal paste in GPU is factory ( i am afraid od chaning that, I must change the pads also and be careful and It doesnt 100% guarantee sucess.. one dude from 100 fixed this problem with changing thermal paste in his GPU )\n\nAlso i am monitoring my temps.\nGPU 40 Celsius mild use\nGPU 56-69 Celsius heavy use\nIve got very good fans and cooling circulation.\n\n\nProblem was ocuring without heavy use, no high temp and also on heavy use with higher temp with 3D software. \n\n\n\nI am feeling that problem is GPU or PSU for me. And it need to be changed. How can I guarantee which one is the cultist from this description? \n\n\nWhat are your suggestions?\n\n\n\n\n\nPS for this story\nI dont wanna say goodbye to my sweet old GTX1080 it held me in my teenage gaming age through my early work carier. 🥹  She is very good and monster by the power I need. I am afraid to change her, she was loyal and made things possible! 🥹 Is there a way to save her? \nRTX cards are not the right type for me. But if destiny writes that it needs to be changed.. I will grab a new RTX.. need to continue my workflow and projects are coming. ",

Last night I was playing on my phone watching “best 2025 PC build” videos, and every creator has a completely different opinion one says go AMD, the next says Intel, one says air cooling is fine, another says liquid or bust. Now I’m just stuck second-guessing everything.   \nI’ve got around $1,500 saved up and I mostly play FPS and some light editing, but I want the build to last a few years. Is there a simple way to narrow this stuff down without going insane from comparison overload?\n\nWould love any advice or even just hearing what helped other people finally pull the trigger on their first build.",

I already purchased some Silicon Power DDR5 32GB (https://amzn.eu/d/5FlhP1h) because it was cheap at the time and the reviews on Amazon were 4.6 with 1,900 reviews. I only realised after purchasing when filtering reviews for that skew the reviews are really bad for compatibility and other issues, so I'll likely to return this. \n\nI have a budget of £150 and I'm trying to decide between these two which have the same price:\n\nTeamGroup Delta RGB 32GB (2X16GB) DDR5 PC5-44800C30 6000MHz Dual Channel Kit - Black (FF3D532G6000HC30DC01)\n\nVs\n\nCORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 6000MHz CMT32GX5M2B6000C30\n\nIt's been a while since I've built a pc but I've never heard of TeamGroup although they seem quite well regarded with reviews. The website listing only mentions XMP but according to several sources it supports EXPO as well and is listed on my motherboards compatible list. \n\nSaying that the corsair definitely looks like a more premium kit for the same money. My only concern is that it's only XMP (although I've heard you can still use A-XMP on newer Bios to make it work) and it isn't listed on my motherboards compatible list. \n\nWould it be foolish to buy the corsair kit? \n\nThanks Again",

    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI recently build a new rig a few days ago with the following specs:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor\n* GPU: PNY Triple Fan Plus OC GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card\n* Motherboard: Gigabyte B650 EAGLE AX ATX AM5 Motherboard\n* Memory: Crucial Pro Overclocking 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL36 Memory\n* Storage: Crucial P3 Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\n* Storage: Crucial MX500 500 GB 2.5\" Solid State Drive (Old SSD I reused)\n* Storage: ASENNO 1TB 2.5 Inch SSD Internal Solid State Drive (Old SSD I reused)\n* Power Supply: Thermaltake Toughpower GT 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\n* CPU Cooler: Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler\n* Case Fan: Thermalright TL-C12C-S X3 66.17 CFM 120 mm Fans 3-Pack  (x2)\n\nHowever, every time I start a game it crashes within the first 5 minutes. I've tried running the Finals, Counter Strike 2, Alan Wake 2 (I'm going to go loco if I had to replay through that starting scene one more time), etc. Sometimes, my whole system will crash (I can't even pull up task manager) and I'll have to do a hard reboot.\n\nThis is a completely new system. When upgrading, I backed up my important data, wiped my SSDs, did a fresh install of Windows 11 (begrudgingly), and transferred over the important data to the new SSD (2TB M.2 SSD) which has the Windows 11 installation. My old system was using Windows 10 and if you're wondering why I didn't just install my old SSDs into my new system and upgraded Windows 10 to 11, I had it dual-booted with Linux Mint using grub. I ran into some issues with the system not being able to locate the boot manager and boot loaders, so I thought it was easier to just do a fresh install and transfer over the important stuff.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\n* Disabling DLSS: I'm new to DLSS as my last GPU didn't support it, so I thought disabling it might produce better results. Alas, it did not.\n* Disabling Shadowplay: Similiar to my thoughts on DLSS, except I have used this in the past.\n* Installing older GPU drivers: I downgraded to 3 different Nvidia drivers within the last 6 months, but I've had the same problem in all of them.\n\nPossible problems:\n\n* PSU not providing enough power: PCParkPicker estimates that my current power is around 630W. This should be enough for the 850 PSU, but I'm not 100% on PCPartPicker's accuracy.\n* Using an older UEFI BIOS: I'm currently using a slightly older version F34 of the BIOS for my Gigabyte B650 EAGLE motherboard, even though F35 is available. The reason being is that I read PCIe 5.0 is disabled on F35. I know the difference between PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 is negligible, and I'll upgrade if needs be, but I didn't think it would have an effect.\n* GPU doesn't haven enough voltage: My GPU is a factory OC card. I haven't tweaked the clock speed or voltage on my GPU (except for briefly using the Nvidia autotuner tool), but could the factory OC settings be slightly undervolted? GPU-Z tells me that it currently hovers around 0.8V when idle.\n\nI currently assume it's a GPU problem, but I've not idea tbh. Can anyone provide any insights if it is related to this or some other components?\n\nIt's always worth noting that I'm using a 4k monitor with most of these games running on that display resolution.\n\nEdit:\n\nI got it sorted. I'm sorry for not getting a chance to reply to you guys. I was busy with work and when I was finished, I just got into diagnosing the problem.\n\nThe issue in the end was the BIOS firmware. All I had to update from F34 to F35! That was it! I'm guessing there is an incompatibility with PCIe 5.0 or something else related. Either way, I'm just happy to have it working.\n\nI ended up doing a lot of the suggestions:\n\n* I monitored temperatures using HWiNFO but nothing ever spiked over 70C on the GPU and 60C on the CPU.\n* I did 2 passes of MemTest86 but no errors arose on either pass.\n* I reinstalled drivers after using DDU but it amounted to no changes.\n* I used WhoCrashed to check info on previous crashes. This was quite useful as it showed timestamps of previous crashes with info like this\n\n|Crash dump file:|C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\Minidump\\\\102825-16593-01.dmp (Minidump)|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Bugcheck code:**|0xA(0x28, 0x2, 0x0, 0xFFFFF805DDAEA033)|\n|**Bugcheck name:**|IRQL\\_NOT\\_LESS\\_OR\\_EQUAL|\n|**Bug check description:**|This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH\\_LEVEL or above. This is a software bug.|\n|**Analysis:**|This is a typical software problem. Most likely this is caused by a bug in a driver.|\n\nWhich eventually led me to thinking it was a BIOS or driver issue.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your help guys! And if anyone has a similar issue with a the Gigabyte B650 EAGLE motherboard, UPDATE THE BIOS!",

No video out via HDMI nor the main display itself.\n\nI live in the UK.\n\nI will sell as not working on ebay. Paid £1,800 for it and I feel totally burnt as spending that much money I would expect it to last a decade, if not more. I'll be lucky if I get £100 for it now.\n\nI think laptops are probably prone to dying fast due to tiny space of the body and components packed tight together with inadequate cooling.\n\nIt's been 13 years since I last built a PC. So I am well out of touch with current PC tech.\n\nBudget is about £1,800. Doesn't mean I want to spend all of it. Obviously the less spent the better.\n\nI currently have a P2450H display which is very outdated I know. Would love to get a 1440p slightly bigger display if I could afford it.\n\nI will edit videos for YouTube. Not cinematic pro stuff, just vlogs and screen recordings made using OBS.\n\nI play games like, A Plague Tale, Subnautica, Hitman, Sleeping Dogs, Frostpunk, Cyberpunk,    maybe the new GTA when it comes out, and some triple AAA titles.\n\nI like to play either very high or ultra settings. Usually not much difference visually between very high and ultra.\n\nI do not care about high hz. I do not want to game at higher than 60fps. I do not play competitive FPS so couldn't care less.\n\nWhat parts should I buy?\n\nShould I reuse the NVME M.2 SSD from my current laptop?\n\nI want the build to be as quiet and cool as possible.",

When I did that, there was a tiny spark, a pop, and everything flickered and shut down, with what I believe was one of the MOSFETs giving off a tiny bit of smoke.\n\nNow I know the mobo is definitely damaged and I'm going to replace it, but right now my question is should I replace the power supply as well? I did the paperclip test and the fan turned on, but I'm afraid to use the same power supply and fry the new mobo as well. I've done a lot of googling on this with no clear answer so I figured I'd pitch it to the experts here. Happy to answer any questions and deserve the sighs at the rookie mistake I've made. I really want to avoid the extra $70 for a new power supply but not at the cost of breaking more things along the way.\n\nSETUP: \n\nRyzen 5 3600x\n\nEVGA 2080 Super\n\nCorsair Vengeance Pro RGB (2x8gb)\n\nAorus B450 Pro Wifi (damaged board)\n\nCorsair CX750m power supply\n\n(old cooler) stock AMD cooler\n\n(new cooler) Thermalright Peerless Assassin ARGB\n\n(old case) NZXT H510i \n\n(new case) Inland X1 ATX-Mid",

I clearly did not see the speed when I bought it because I would've stuck to my original plan otherwise.\n\nSince the rest of the parts aren't going to be in this week, I have time to make a choice: keep what I bought or return it for something else.

Do I really want to risk going back into the market where memory prices have literally doubled in a month with no signs of stopping?",

I already purchased some Silicon Power DDR5 32GB (https://amzn.eu/d/5FlhP1h) because it was cheap at the time and the reviews on Amazon were 4.6 with 1,900 reviews. I only realised after purchasing when filtering reviews for that skew the reviews are really bad for compatibility and other issues, so I'll likely to return this. \n\nI have a budget of £150 and I'm trying to decide between these two which have the same price:\n\nTeamGroup Delta RGB 32GB (2X16GB) DDR5 PC5-44800C30 6000MHz Dual Channel Kit - Black (FF3D532G6000HC30DC01)\n\nVs\n\nCORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 6000MHz CMT32GX5M2B6000C30\n\nIt's been a while since I've built a pc but I've never heard of TeamGroup although they seem quite well regarded with reviews. The website listing only mentions XMP but according to several sources it supports EXPO as well and is listed on my motherboards compatible list. \n\nSaying that the corsair definitely looks like a more premium kit for the same money. My only concern is that it's only XMP (although I've heard you can still use A-XMP on newer Bios to make it work) and it isn't listed on my motherboards compatible list. \n\nWould it be foolish to buy the corsair kit? \n\nThanks Again",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community: [https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

    "selftext": "How were games being developed 10-20 years ago in shorter time frames with extreme technological limitations compared to today, and yet those games were perceived much higher quality while the studios were happy with their profit margins?  \n  \nCompared to today, where you would think that with how far we’ve come with technological advancement that games should be much easier to make, cost far less money to create(especially digital copies reducing disk/case production), and should run far better with the amazing hardware we all have. Yet all we hear is company XYZ cutting corners, firing staff, poor optimizations, $90 price tag etc. while somehow these companies are also still not making enough money?  \n  \nFor example, how was Infinity Ward/Activision able to make one of the greatest COD games MW2 in 16 months and run on a PS3 with 256mb ram near flawlessly, but I can’t even run Warzone smoothly on low settings on my fucking RTX5070 with 32gb RAM, and they’ve been actively developing/patching that garbage for like 5-7 years? Not to mention the fact they’ve milked revenue from that game the whole time through skins while MW2 was being patched for free.     \n  \n  \nIt sounds stupid, but did these companies forget about saving money by hiring talented people who can manage projects and create quality products within reasonable constraints, who understand limitations and can be creative to work around them? Why are studios hiring people who create garbage then spend a year(s) post production patching the game to make it playable? In the construction industry there’s a saying we use along the lines of, “If you have time to come back and fix it, you had time to do it right the first time.”. \n  \nBit of a rant but also a general curiosity on how this industry has completely evolved to something that doesn’t seem to understand what they’ve got their hands on. This seems like the best time to make unbelievable money and create amazing quality games and it just isn’t happening for some of these big names.\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n",

Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system. Notice how a lot of competitive games are labeled as \"toxic\"? Its because people are always blaming others.\n\nI can't think of a single time where I hard raged in a single player game. Why? Because I know that my perfomance is directly related the only variable; me. \n\nSorry for the yap. Was pooping on the toliet and just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\n",

The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs.*\n\n*“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” wrote Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Games, in an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg News.*",

    "selftext": "Seven years ago I had this idea for an underwater PvP survival game. No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ≠ skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \n🎮 Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

    "selftext": "I picked it up yesterday to play with my friends for the first time. I was surprised (in a positive way) at how mechanicaly complex it can be, especially the organizing and reparing the RV part of the game. It seems like the type of game that it's both fun and exciting to master in the long run, BUT I was astonished at how bad it overall works. To the point of taking you out of the immersion multiple times.\n\n\\- This is a physics-based game in which the physics barely work. The rope, the constantly clipping in and out of the RV, the weird collision issues... it's everywhere.\n\n\\- This is a pity, but there's barely a sense of danger or stakes whatosever. From time to time an animal will attack, or there will be a terrain obstacle to overcome, but that's pretty much it. In a way it's cool, this can be a calmer game that, let's say, Peak or REPO. But it also means that in the moment to moment gameplay it can sometimes be somewhat boring, especially because--\n\n\\- This is one of my biggest complaints right now. The multiplayer of this game i feel is not balanced. There were four of us in the RV, and for most of the time, it feels like the game would have worked better with just two. It didn't seem to me like there was much to be done. The person driving has such and advantage mechanically, and there can also be a person looking at the map, but other than that, this is not a Sea of Theves type of thing were EVERY person is needed to manouver the boat. The other two of us were just in the back, seated because you can NOT be walking around the RV while someone's driving because the physics turn crazy. That means it's not a time that you can spend maybe organising the cabinets, playing cards (this is not a mechanic but it would be cool) or something like that.\n\nI want to end on a positive note. Like I said, I really love the premise of the game. It's so unique and full of potential (the chain-smoking is hilarious). If it was well polished and with expanded mechanics, this could be like a land version of Sea of Thieves. But right now is everything but polished. It's so bizarre to me that this is a 1.0 release and not an early access.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe’ve been working on a game called Mexican Ninja for a while now and wanted to finally share it with the PC gaming crowd. It’s a fast, chaotic beat ’em up roguelike made between Colombia and Mexico by a nimble team at Madbricks, published by Amber.\n\nThe project started from an idea by our IP creator, who’s Mexican, and it’s directed by another Mexican creative lead on the team. The mix of cultures is a big part of what makes the game special - Nuevo Tokyo is this strange world where Japan and Mexico collided, and Narcos + Yakuzas joined forces to rule the streets. You play as the Mexican Ninja fighting back through random runs full of combos, spirit powers and ridiculous chaos.\n\nIt’s basically what happens if Guacamelee, Streets of Rage and an old arcade machine got drunk together.\n\nWe dropped our announcement trailer a few months ago and it ended up getting picked up by IGN. It’s been doing surprisingly well: 280k+ views and a lot of feedback that helped us polish the demo.\n\nThe demo’s now live on Steam if you want to check it out.\n\nWould love to hear what you think. We’ve been working hard to make every run feel wild but still skill-based. Also, if you die a lot, that’s part of the design. Promise!\n\nThanks for taking a look! I’ll be around in the comments if anyone wants to chat about the dev process, the chaos behind making this thing, or anything else.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is Garrett Thompson, sole member of *Act-Novel*\\-- a fake Japanese doujin circle that is currently working on a debating RPG/adventure game situated somewhere in the zone between *Persona* and *Ace Attorney*. It's called *Reality Layer Zero* because it's about unraveling mysteries and finding the \"absolute truth\" underneath layers upon layers of obfuscation. Well, if that's even possible (heh heh). \n\nDescribing the gameplay is a little bit trickly. Essentially, you're going around winning debates against people by beating them at card games. Naturally, this allows you to mind-control them, which is useful for finding out stuff you're not supposed to know.\n\nThe card game in question revolves around manipulating the three rhetorical modes (logos, ethos, and pathos) to pay for rhetoric (spell) and argument (score) cards. I struggle to call to mind anything quite like this system-- I think I came up with it from half-remembering the *Pokémon* card game and mashing that up with the summoning mechanics from *Golden Sun?* That short description might give you a strong impression of what it plays like... But it's probably not like that at all!\n\n... Anyway, for this update, I primarily focused on redoing character artwork in dialog portraits to adhere more closely to the academic proportions of realistic humans, as well as on postprocessing effects (e.g. bloom, focal blur) to improve the fidelity of the 3D scenes.\n\nFor comparison's sake, not too long ago the game looked like this: [https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi](https://youtu.be/UW1KGYFuGE8?si=HJq10DcC1-F3IiQi)\n\nAs you can probably tell, I didn't really start this project as an artist. I still probably wouldn't consider myself one. Still, I decided to overhaul the game's visuals primarily because I wanted to improve at making art. I hope I've made at least a little progress toward that goal! \n\nAnyway, thank you for your consideration! You can find the project on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985290/Reality_Layer_Zero/) and [itch.io](https://act-novel.itch.io/reality-layer-zero)\\-- whichever you fancy (although Itch *does* give the additional option to download older versions, including ones using the \"beta\" art e.g. v3.2.1.1).",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community: [https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

    "selftext": "Seven years ago I had this idea for an underwater PvP survival game. No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

Yet, all of them have felt like they are missing something fundamentally \n\nI have the most hours on Hoi4 and I will say with mods the game gets a nice refresh and depth but it’s still more of a military simulation, I wish the game had a deeper economic and law system \n\nSuperpower 2 has a special place in my heart but it’s way too simple and the game tends to break after awhile \n\nSuperpower 3 is completely garbage and can’t even be considered a game since it’s developers abandoned it after release \n\nRealpolitiks is good and has a nice UI but the gameplay is too simple and boring. The new game is also completely broken and not playable \n\nIt feels like every new game that comes out is so broken and incomplete. I am hopeful that this will give some room and demand for a developer to make something really special that will have little to no competition \n\n",

    "selftext": "I've been making Skyformer full time since 2021 with both my own game engine and art, and I'm finally announcing the PC Early Access release date on Steam for November 10th 2025. \n\nIt's a first-person survival/automation/crafting game where you're a little robot sent to a planet with the assignment to make it habitable. You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community: [https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSo basically, I currently have a Hyper X wireless only gaming headset that I got as a gift last Christmas. The main issue I've had with it is that I keep getting audio distortion when too much sound is going on at once. Couldn't ever seem to have fixed it no matter what I tried and forgot to exchange/ return them. Ironically, it seems to work really well on my Macbook Pro for taking work calls/ meetings; the complete opposite of gaming haha. \n\n  \nI recently saw something about how it's actually more worthwhile to have a separate headphone microphone solution as opposed to a all in one gaming headset because it gives you lots more options for what headset you could pick since you're not tied down to only gaming headsets.\n\nThis would just be for casual gaming and maybe if I really like the setup a lot to also take work calls but that's really it, I don't stream or anything like that.\n\nSo, with all that being said, I have absolutely zero knowledge of what a good microphone would be and same with headphones. I've only ever really bought headphones in the past for listening to music, not for gaming; that's what I'd buy gaming headsets for. \n\n\n\nAt the moment, I do already own a pair of Beats Studios and another pair of Sony WH-1000XM2 and don't have an issue reusing these if they're actually good for playing games. I don't have a microphone since I've never really needed a separate dedicated microphone before. I also have a pair of Sony Pulse headphones which I know are technically gaming headphones but I thought I'd throw them in there since Sony makes some pretty good headsets. The only real requirement i have is that they are wired. I'm moving over from wireless to wired peripherals because my experience going all wireless was terrible with lots of connectivity issues.  ",

I assume because Battlefield requires a lot more to run.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4lcuewnw4yf1.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa1bd5cc0e887493bcb11771b4e34c56035653c3\n\n  \n",

I installed all the drivers, and everything worked fine for a while — until I installed the Faceit anti-cheat. After installing it, my PC rebooted, and then I started getting blue screens.\n\nAfter some trial and error, I figured out that it happens because of SVM (virtualization). When I disable it, everything works fine.\n\nI kept digging into the issue — and just to answer the usual suggestions right away — I don’t have AppCenter or EasyTune installed. I also tried deleting gdrv3.sys in Safe Mode, but I still get blue screens. I’ve reinstalled the drivers twice and updated the BIOS via USB flash drive — no result.\n\nIf you can help me get Faceit working, I’ll pray for you for the rest of my life.\n",

This money came from my savings which I need to replace asap. This means I have to sell some stuff to catch up.\n\nI decided to let go of my most valuable items. This means all of SFF water cooling gear that is in my Formd T1 right now. It’s the real deal, lots of fittings, QDC, Lobo, EK DDC, EK res and D5, Heatkiller V block. Basically all the stuff I spent so much time and money collecting to build a completely custom rig. Anyways I figured someone here can resonate with this and find some humor in my loss. I don’t want to tell her that’s why I’m selling it also because she will be sad Such is life and I wish you the best. No reason to get too down in the dumps, air cooling is still sufficient and I’m lucky to still have a good rig in this economy lol. \n\nHave a great night everyone! ",

Lucky to hit 20-25, but hey, it ran.\n\nBack in the day, most 3D games straight-up demanded a dedicated GPU just to boot, and that shit was luxury AF in 2008-2009. A legendary 9400GT? Around 2-3 million VND(100 USD). Cheaper crap like the 7100GS? Not even worth the hassle.\n\nEnter this software: it emulates and fools the game into thinking you've got a real discrete GPU, so your rig can actually play. Boom, access granted.\n\nBut let's be real – it's \"playable\" at best, not smooth sailing. FPS tanks hard, graphics look like ass 'cause you gotta slam every setting to rock bottom (think 640x480 on very low). Even then, cracking 30 FPS – the bare-minimum benchmark back then – was a pipe dream.\n\nIf it still chugged, the squad would stack it with other hacks like Modded Drivers, GMA Booster, Swift Shader, or Software Renderer... whatever it took to gut the game and make it feather-light for bare survival.\n\nSounds nuts, right? But for us \"poor boys\" grinding in Vietnam, my country, 30 FPS was straight fantasy fuel. Tougher spots? 5-10 FPS could still get you through – just \"keep your head down\" for real, minimizing loaded models like a stealth ninja, peeking up only when you had to.\n\n3D Analyze was a legit MVP in the war to conquer games on G31/G41 boards for bros overflowing with passion but zero budget. Hell, we even formed crews back then dedicated to \"G31/G41 vs. All Games.\"\n\nTalk about necessity breeding genius!",

    "selftext": "Hello all, I'm a little troubled because this is the first time I've run into a situation like this.\n\nWith this new build I'm running a Gigabyte B650M GAMING PLUS WIFI with a 7600X3D, 32 GBS of DDR5 6000, and a 2TB M.2 SSD. For whatever reason whenever I was downloading drivers, or attempting to download Chrome it would kill my entire network and kick all devices off the Wi-Fi. My pre-built never had these kinds of issues downloading anything of the sort. Here's what I've tried so far:\n\n\\- Limiting how much I can download and upload\n\n\\- Updating my modem's firmware to the latest version (the modem itself supports Wi-Fi 5)\n\n\\- Ensuring that my Wi-Fi drivers are the latest version (via GCC app and USB tethering to download them)\n\nI'm not super tech literate so apologies if this theory is stupidly inaccurate but the only thing I can think of is this new PC taking up too much bandwidth possibly overloading my network? The motherboard I have does claim that it's able to push Wi-Fi 6 speeds and that could be what's causing it to crash? But I've no idea how to fix that. I'll leave a picture attached that is blurry (sorry) but it shows what happens when I start that Chrome download.\n\n[Blurry screenshot of me downloading chrome and the Wi-Fi crashing mid download](https://preview.redd.it/a1bfsu7v94yf1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=f55e2ea865e8e1102b474f0a5a04b650606a0dcb)\n\nAny advice, or things to try to hopefully not crash the whole network and piss off anyone else in my household would be greatly appreciated.",

Also in terms of Budget  I am happy to spend £1k but dont mind going over it, as I do not tend ot upgrade unless the games that start releasing are just becoming tolling to my system.\n\nIn regards to what games I play, I tend to play anything and everything, that includes offline and online games and of course graphically beautiful games and not so graphically demanding but CPU demanding ones, such as MMOs where I like to PvP and that involves alot of players in one screen. I am grateful for any suggestions. Also do not stress too much on the budget, as long as we are not hitting some crazy prices I am happy for any suggestions.",

    "title": "Is my CPU Damaged?",
    "selftext": "Context:\nI have a laptop, GTX 1660 ti + Ryzen 7 4000 series CPU. For the first two years of its life it’s given me outstanding performance in any game I throw at it medium-high settings 1080p display (this was my first PC prior to me getting a desktop recently). I believe it has 8 cores. But anyways, I believe my CPU is the culprit of a variety of things. For one, my PC frequently crashes, and whatever sound is playing at the time will buzz loudly. Then it restarts. Next, while playing a game I’ve been playing for years I see a notice a fps drop with the same settings from back then when I would consistently max out my monitor 144 hertz display now it struggles to get 120 at low-medium settings. Yes it is a game where it has been updated many times over the course of 4 years since I bought and started playing on it but that’s not it. I sometimes see visual artifacts (rarely) like shadows not rendering properly.\n\nMy prognosis is that the CPU has heat damage. I figured this and after installing Afterburner OSD and running my game i notice that the temps are hovering in the high 90s-100s. Sometimes reaching 110 degrees. Keep in mind I’ve been gaming on this PC for 4 years hard, like really hard. I keep the vents free of debris but it doesn’t matter I guess. Often times the room I was in was a bit warm…\n\nMy only concern about it being the cpu or not is I thought CPUs had built-in self saving protocol when it gets too hot (make that make sense)\n\nOh I should mention one more thing. It only crashes when I’m not gaming, when I’m gaming, it NEVER has crashed. Not once. Only happens when I’m doing light stuff like YouTube and web browsing and it has happened when I tried downloading something. \n\nI figured there might be time to re-paste it(keep in mind it’s the first re paste I ever did since receiving it 4 years ago), maybe the paste slid over the die and now theres patches of no paste. I did re paste my CPU + GPU. Can’t remember if I saw improved temperatures or not (maybe like 10 degree better i don’t know)",

Can I expect any sales that will get me in this range? If so, where do you all recommend watching?\n\nI used Newegg to enter some games and see what they recommend, but it was recommending some PCs that had integrated graphics cards and saying they will play Cyberpunk at moderate settings, so I'm not trusting it.

Lucky to hit 20-25, but hey, it ran.\n\nBack in the day, most 3D games straight-up demanded a dedicated GPU just to boot, and that shit was luxury AF in 2008-2009. A legendary 9400GT? Around 2-3 million VND(100 USD). Cheaper crap like the 7100GS? Not even worth the hassle.\n\nEnter this software: it emulates and fools the game into thinking you've got a real discrete GPU, so your rig can actually play. Boom, access granted.\n\nBut let's be real – it's \"playable\" at best, not smooth sailing. FPS tanks hard, graphics look like ass 'cause you gotta slam every setting to rock bottom (think 640x480 on very low). Even then, cracking 30 FPS – the bare-minimum benchmark back then – was a pipe dream.\n\nIf it still chugged, the squad would stack it with other hacks like Modded Drivers, GMA Booster, Swift Shader, or Software Renderer... whatever it took to gut the game and make it feather-light for bare survival.\n\nSounds nuts, right? But for us \"poor boys\" grinding in Vietnam, my country, 30 FPS was straight fantasy fuel. Tougher spots? 5-10 FPS could still get you through – just \"keep your head down\" for real, minimizing loaded models like a stealth ninja, peeking up only when you had to.\n\n3D Analyze was a legit MVP in the war to conquer games on G31/G41 boards for bros overflowing with passion but zero budget. Hell, we even formed crews back then dedicated to \"G31/G41 vs. All Games.\"\n\nTalk about necessity breeding genius!",

    "selftext": "Summary\n\n* The product does not contain acetoxy silicone.\n* The product is manufactured in South Korea.\n* The company is currently in operation, and its address has been verified.\n* The company is discussing on verification methods, and exploring possible laboratory tests through certified testing institutions.\n* So, most of the claims made against this product and the company are false.\n\nThe company is a sole proprietorship and is at risk of suspending operations due to this incident.

The person who posted on Quasarzone kept modifying the content of the post while demanding compensation, then eventually withdrew the demands and left.\n\n[original link(dcinside SFF Gallery)](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=sff&no=1456811)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odpdxzea4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=c906d10a7957c8ebb74b370bed42c54227e8e8eb\n\nFig. 1. MSDS of SGT-4 posted on the AMeCh homepage Most thermal-paste products use polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, often called \"silicone oil\") as a dispersing medium, and disperse heat-transfer media such as Al2O3 (alumina). I confirmed from the attached photo that SGT-4 also uses PDMS and alumina, etc. But in the issue raised by Igor Lab, the ingredient causing the sour smell was suggested to be acetoxy silicone (acetoxy silane), and AMeCh asserted that it is not. So I treated the question of whether acetoxy silane was added to SGT-4 as the point of contention, and I did an analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mje10mdt5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=fed09c9f69e2b172fbf14e473bd56495f4e455d8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vue0nw6g4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bbf92d1120d32a163ff499d6465d1a1fb43b88d\n\nFig. 2. a) photo of SGT-4 separated by centrifuge using nhexane as solvent, b) after removing organic layer with rotary evaporator First, since PDMS or acetoxy silane are both organics, in order to extract the organic matter from SGT-4 I used a centrifuge to separate out the organic layer; in the filtering process I used a 0.2 µm syringe filter to catch any inorganic particles that might have gotten in. Then I evaporated the filtered solution to isolate the organic matter inside SGT-4 alone, and did 1H NMR measurement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mc36gmru5zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=57ee11762c1e4e4a8075185c565e344efcbea7d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxffrg6j4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=8028a8d52024fb35e705f19eb5f6cd57d375723d\n\nFig. 3. a) certificate of the PDMS measured as control, b) NMR spectrum of that sample If you studied organic chemistry you know roughly what NMR is: hydrogen atoms in organics are influenced by nearby atoms and take particular positions and shapes in the spectrum, and the integrated area of each peak is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms - so you can infer structure from it. As shown in the certificate in Fig. 3, the PDMS in question has a terminal -OH group accounting for 1.4% by mass; interpreting together with the NMR result: since the spectrum is measured relative to TMS as standard, given PDMS with Si-CH3 bonded to the Si atoms, we expect a peak very close to 0 ppm from Si-CH3, and at 2.12 ppm we measured the broad -OH peak characteristic of the terminal -OH. Because the terminal OH mass ratio is 1.4%, if you reversecalculate the ratio of OH: CH3 integration, you get roughly 98 : 1 - considering it is a polymer NMR this is reasonably consistent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptta1gvl4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=727b31f1ac87443d8f8e2fdc7b8b53c0ed5dcf12\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si6zd69m4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=5646b1b6511ee2e567794d1a5bd0cb3f74f63ea5\n\nFig. 4. NMR spectrum of organic matter extracted from SGT-4 Now let's look at the SGT-4 result. The reason I posted two spectra is that the CH3 peak is so distinct that minor peaks get buried in it unless you zoom in. Compared to the control, there appear to be many small peaks. That's because in NMR the peak intensity is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms being measured; even if it's a mixture, if one hydrogen atom type is detected a lot then the remaining hydrogen types inevitably appear relatively small. Anyway, in the result we observe, just like in the control, a prominent Si-CH3 peak is detected, and the remaining peaks are likely due to additives, or possibly the PDMS used is not a typical linear structure but something branched or otherwise modified - there are various possibilities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yuj1u4p4zxf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bfeeea4330e1e66be2edf9583bde10f0f84fc4c\n\nFig. 5. Molecular structures of various kinds of acetoxy silanes However, if you look at the structure of acetoxy silane, they commonly share an acetyloxy group (O=C-CH3). The CH3 of that functional group is characterized by a peak around \\~2.0 ppm. I enlarged it quite a bit but I did not observe a peak in that region. Now you might argue \"Well if acetoxy silane is included in a very small amount then it might not be detectable by NMR, right?\" But in the first place, if something is present only to the point where you can't see it on NMR, is that amount enough to give off a detectable smell when it oxidizes and humans smell it? That's what I wonder.\n\nConclusion: In the sample I measured, I did not see the 1H proton peak attributable to the acetyloxy group of acetoxy silane. Even if an extremely small amount was added and not detected, I'm of the opinion that at this level of non-detection it would be hard for humans to even smell it in the first place. I'm not sure whether I will additionally measure IR or DSC at the current stage.\n\n\\-> A full translation of original report by dcinside sff gallery user\n\nFurthermore -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tdyrp8z4zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a396337027b01b8f556aa757c1ca2c77719b97f\n\nBusiness registration certificate (Amech)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2rqem655zxf1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=666112fd0b760afeff4b1e4547230c3bf0ecb71a\n\noffice(a apartment style factory/지식산업센터), Room 504\n\n경상북도 포항시 북구 흥해읍 융합기술로 66, 504(포항지식산업센터)\n\n[Road View](https://map.naver.com/p/search/%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,%20504%28%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%A7%80%EC%8B%9D%EC%82%B0%EC%97%85%EC%84%BC%ED%84%B0%29/address/14395620.4671225,4309151.0136731,%EA%B2%BD%EC%83%81%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84%20%ED%8F%AC%ED%95%AD%EC%8B%9C%20%EB%B6%81%EA%B5%AC%20%ED%9D%A5%ED%95%B4%EC%9D%8D%20%EC%9C%B5%ED%95%A9%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0%EB%A1%9C%2066,new?c=18.01,0,0,0,adh&isCorrectAnswer=true&p=hqnmZMQfY2hmxuyOb5DYsw,-119.09,11.82,80,Float) \\- naver maps",

    "selftext": "Obviously pretty much everyone knows this, but if you don't...\n\nMost major retailers extend returns until Jan. 31 for holiday shopping done after Oct. 31st.. So if you get your parts early in Nov, you get an extra +2 months of \"warranty\" that can go back to the retailer for faulty parts. Much easier than sending something back to warranty support nether-regions of hell.\n\nEven if you don't need the long return window for testing parts, it still can help if you are doing a trickle purchase method of getting parts over a longer period of time to maximize discounts. With nearly 90 days of return window you can shop for deals longer and then when put together you aren't screwed by any part not working that is outside of a return window.\n\n",

She is mildly autistic and I think more than anything she just wants to be apart of the community more than anything. She doesnt expect some top of the line PC, just something that she can get into a make friends, play games online and not be too limited. She is adamant that she doesn't want a laptop also.\n\nShe has been playing Elder Scrolls for years and years, she loves Minecraft, Roblox, and she always talks about wanting to play RDR2 and sometimes talks about being interested in trying Cyberpunk.\n\nI guess I'm obviously most worried about price. I feel like I can spare around 600 (give or take) for the PC, I know I will need to get the peripherals also, but that part I can manage. I'd like to take advantage of Black Friday sales if possible? Can I expect any sales that will get me in this range? If so, where do you all recommend watching?\n\nI used Newegg to enter some games and see what they recommend, but it was recommending some PCs that had integrated graphics cards and saying they will play Cyberpunk at moderate settings, so I'm not trusting it. I'd rather come to Reddit and ask.\n\nThank you all in advance.",

High St., Dublin, OH 43017)  \nDiscord: [Ohio MK](https://discord.gg/YmPypPj)\n\nWe've been in a bit of a scramble since our previous venue shut down, but thankfully we were able to pull something together before the end of the year!\n\n**No tickets are required**, thanks to the library having a free space for us to use. However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

Interchanged the switches and that made it better for maybe a couple days and then back to the faulty behavior. since i was out of warranty there is was nothing for me to do in that department. My dad saw my frustration and gave me his keyboard since his work barely needs him to use a computer barely if at all.\n\nI brushed it off as dumb luck and moved on, last month the warranty expired on the new one and low and behold the second keyboard has found the same fate.\n\nOut of desperation, i soldered the switches to the PCB and that worked for a bit but after about 10 days i find myself back on square-one.\n\nI didn't want this to be rant on Keychron but it is very frustrating, especially given how expensive the keyboards are, about 9500 INR.\n\nAlso, would like to disclose I do not have any conflict of interest, meagerly an under-satisfied customer who was very enthusiastic for his new keyboard :( ",

Any tips or links would be super helpful.\n2. I also have a Cycle 7, but unfortunately, I lost its wireless receiver. Does anyone know if it’s possible to pair it with a new receiver, or if there’s a way to buy a replacement dongle directly from the manufacturer?\n\nThankss",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

You can find the rest of my posts here, where I'm posting a keyboard every week for a whole year, 52 boards, with 6 down and 46 more to go.\n\nWeek 1: [Vertex Arc60](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1npcvs7/im_posting_a_picture_of_a_different_mechanical/)  \nWeek 2: [Lazydesigners Cloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1ntnjbu/im_posting_a_keyboard_a_week_for_the_next_year/)  \nWeek 3: [Sneakbox AVA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1nzmknb/im_posting_a_keeb_a_week_this_is_week_3_sneakbox/)  \nWeek 4: [Viktus Styrka](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1o5mc5w/week_4_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_for/)  \nWeek 5: [Hola Mini](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1obmwjr/week_5_of_posting_a_fresh_board_every_week_a_year/)\n\nOf course, since I'm going through the trouble to document all of these boards after building such a large collection, I've been adding their finer details to a the [cataloging and sharing app Keebuilder](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/), this way I'll eventually have all of my builds and the parts used in a single place.

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks — band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast 🙂.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me — in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn’t make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they’ll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly — The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay’s voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away → Roxette**  \nI’m still in love with Marie Fredriksson’s voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 → Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele — the man, the music, the attitude — pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F → Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The “3” also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit — Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 → 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it’s probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive →** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt’s pure freedom, soul, happiness — life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins… and hopefully Bart’s story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy — build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power → N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote “tuurnn” next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in — just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane →** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane — the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations →** had to be here anyway, but this one’s a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song’s energy, Mark’s wild teenage years, his early work — all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we’re at it…\n\n**P.I.J M.M → Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite — the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE → Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come Through* would’ve been too many “dreams” — and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire → Scooter (HP Baxxter’s voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in Pécs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously — the best element!\n\n**Out of Space → The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under “Space”, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune’s “I was sent to outer space,” and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can’t Stop Raving* didn’t fit anymore 😅.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True →** basically the slogan of the ’90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven’t outgrown it — and honestly, “growing up” was never my strong suit 🙂.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? →** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I’ve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here — sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** — doesn’t need explaining, but I shouldn’t forget it either.\n* **NRG** — same energy.\n* **Music** — the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** — cliché, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** — probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** — took a while to find. Wanted something that says “I don’t fit in boxes,” kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** — because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** — as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** — one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny “-drive,” because if it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn’t stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches… the works.\n\nThat’s about all that fit — for now.  \nI’ve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer — brush smears the paint, and I don’t want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway… I’ve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the ***Logitech G915 TKL*** and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the *G515* with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the ***Keychron K1 Max*** with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using [launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/) but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use [usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

Interchanged the switches and that made it better for maybe a couple days and then back to the faulty behavior. since i was out of warranty there is was nothing for me to do in that department. My dad saw my frustration and gave me his keyboard since his work barely needs him to use a computer barely if at all.\n\nI brushed it off as dumb luck and moved on, last month the warranty expired on the new one and low and behold the second keyboard has found the same fate.\n\nOut of desperation, i soldered the switches to the PCB and that worked for a bit but after about 10 days i find myself back on square-one.\n\nI didn't want this to be rant on Keychron but it is very frustrating, especially given how expensive the keyboards are, about 9500 INR.\n\nAlso, would like to disclose I do not have any conflict of interest, meagerly an under-satisfied customer who was very enthusiastic for his new keyboard :( ",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

    "selftext": "Review time!\n\nModel: XVX MU68 FujiWave Theme Mechanical Keyboard | XVX/WORMIER\n\nPrice: $100 USD (20% discount for the week of Halloween)\n\nSize: 65%, 68 keys\n\nKeycaps: MOA profile, PBT\n\nHot Swappable?: Yes, switches are pre-lubed & linear I think\n\nGasket Mount: Yes, but there really isn't any flex?\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\n[https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard](https://www.xvxchannel.com/products/xvx-mu68-fuji-wave-keyboard)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: no, I didn't get this for free, but they did give me the 20% discount for Halloween after I purchased the keyboard because I was a couple days early for the discount and they said that a reddit review would be very helpful to them and I thought \"wow, that's a great idea. Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

High St., Dublin, OH 43017)  \nDiscord: [Ohio MK](https://discord.gg/YmPypPj)\n\nWe've been in a bit of a scramble since our previous venue shut down, but thankfully we were able to pull something together before the end of the year!\n\n**No tickets are required**, thanks to the library having a free space for us to use. However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

Interchanged the switches and that made it better for maybe a couple days and then back to the faulty behavior. since i was out of warranty there is was nothing for me to do in that department. My dad saw my frustration and gave me his keyboard since his work barely needs him to use a computer barely if at all.\n\nI brushed it off as dumb luck and moved on, last month the warranty expired on the new one and low and behold the second keyboard has found the same fate.\n\nOut of desperation, i soldered the switches to the PCB and that worked for a bit but after about 10 days i find myself back on square-one.\n\nI didn't want this to be rant on Keychron but it is very frustrating, especially given how expensive the keyboards are, about 9500 INR.\n\nAlso, would like to disclose I do not have any conflict of interest, meagerly an under-satisfied customer who was very enthusiastic for his new keyboard :( ",

Surrounding this big white mark is a bunch of blue red and green spots.\n\nMy first immediate thought is artifcating of some sort and that my GPU is dying, I switched over to another computer plugged in the display port and the same thing is happening, can’t be GPU.\n\nI disconnected all cables (except the power cable) and this big white spot remains, so it seems to be exclusively the monitor itself and neither of my two computers. Can anyone identify this type of damage?\n\nI’ve taken very good care of my things and wish I saw this happen in real time, but for whatever reason decided to happen when I stepped away. Maybe it’s time I upgrade to OLED? Who knows, but one thing for sure is the monitor will most likely need to go",

Currently I am struggling if VA or IPS is the better option. If you can, please give me some arguments why you prefer it.\n\n**My requirements so far:**  \n\\* 34\" since I need some more horizontal space, upgrading from an old 27\"  \n\\* Dark mode must be fine to look at, also in a dark room with minimal lights  \n\\* Also must be a pleasure to look at, at day time  \n\\* Must be suitable for competitive shooters and solo games (keyword smearing, and so on for VA panels)\n\nI currently tent to buy a VA panel based monitor again - i had no smearing issues. I think that the backglow of IPS would annoy me a lot.\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts, I am completely lost and don't know what to do.  \nThanks c:\n\nEdit:  \nOLED won't be suitable due to burn ins.",

This is all I could do for now and I searched through the posts in here and saw that people suggested mounting the monitor to the wall or buying a monitor arm or even buying a better desk, I may do those in the future when I make the budget. But a question came into my mind; can constant wobbling caused by typing damage the internals of the monitor in\nlong term? For example damaging the panel itself and worsening the backlight bleed for IPS panels or causing any other issue. Can the guys who used their monitor with a little of wobbling in years give me a little review of what has happened to their monitors. ",

I replaced them with some no name product (longer and less stiff and I resolved the problem) I had laying around.\n\nI'm cutting in half every not working cable so that it becomes impossible to reuse them.\n\nIn the last year I had to replace a large number of DP cables (we have about 30 workstations total, nearly every one of the with 2 monitors), no problems with DVI, VGA a nearly no problems with HDMI.\n\nAm I the only one having such problems or is a more common issue?",

Im just asking if someone else has tried both and which one was the \"correct choice\". I know that PPD is more important than PPI but i do sit fairly close to the monitor. I just feel like its not as immersive as i thought it would. The 32Inch that id be going for would be the PG32UCDM. ",

But not sure if I’d suffer for work. I use a MacBook Pro and access my work via Microsoft Remote Desktop. So I’m not sure if it the app will split over both screens or not?\n\nI do have a Sony Bravia 4k 55” TV that I used to use the PS4/5 on but haven’t got it set up in my man cave (the only available wall it could go on is fairly small and may look ridiculous with the TV on it - plus I’d have to wall mount the PS5, too…)\n\nSo, I’m in a bit of a pickle on what to do.

    "selftext": "I'm a developer working from home (\\~10h/day), and I'm looking to replace my LG 34WL75C-B (34\" IPS, 3440x1440 @ 60Hz) to take full advantage of my future upgrade.\n\nI'm planning to upgrade my rig (RTX 5070 Ti or 9070 Ti), which should easily handle 144Hz or even 4K, so I'm taking this opportunity to upgrade my monitor as well.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n* 70% coding (VSCode & co, mostly dark themes), YouTube etc..\n* 30% gaming (hence wanting to enjoy >60Hz)\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n* 34\" ultrawide 21:9\n* 144Hz minimum\n* USB-C with Power Delivery 65W+ (for my MacBook)\n* G-Sync/FreeSync compatible\n* Budget: \\~€700 (flexible if really worth it)\n\nI'm really torn on panel type, resolution, etc. Nothing seems to perfectly fit my hybrid usage...\n\nI'm considering OLED mainly because most high-refresh monitors nowadays are OLED. However, my main concern isn’t really burn-in — it’s text clarity.\n\nI’ve read quite a bit about fringing and subpixel rendering issues at this pixel density (around 110 PPI at 3440x1440), and since I spend most of my day reading and writing code, I just can’t compromise on text sharpness or clarity.\n\n**For those coding on OLED daily:**\n\n* Does text rendering work for you after several hours?\n* Eye fatigue vs IPS?\n* Does burn-in with IDE/toolbars worry you?\n* Does your monitor have USB-C power delivery?\n\nGiven my intensive text usage, does OLED seem suitable or is it a risky bet? \n\nAny IPS alternatives to recommend?\n\nThanks for your feedback!",

    "selftext": "So whats the deal with 100Hz monitors, they seem focused on professional / productivity work mainly.  \nAre these kind of monitors usually locked on 100Hz somehow? \n\nFor example i have Samsung ViewFinity S60D 32\" QHD 100Hz IPS monitor, which is lacking any FreeSync tech and so on, not clearly a gaming focused monitor but weirdly it has picture presets like Game Standard, RPG, RTS and FPS ?!  \nOk  \nI would wanted to use this monitor for some creativity 3D applications and it would been required to run 60fps for reasons, 60fps would been better than 100fps in my case.  \nAs we know in order to run 60fps smoothly, frame timing must be even (16.67ms) so it means that i must set signal to 60Hz from the source (Windows), but..at 60hz - 60fps jarring is noticeable.\n\n  \nI have feeling that this monitor can't run really in 60Hz that's why frames are not even and it outputs as jarring, even i have 3rd party program to show fps and frametime and i can confirm it shows 60fps with 16.67ms.  \nIn 100hz / 100fps everything is buttery smooth..  \n  \nSo is it just a characteristic of this kind monitor or is it faulty?  \nIs there anything what can do , only use another monitors (  I have tho).  \nJust wanted to be sure and have some answers.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been trying for several months to find a decent IPS monitor for both graphic work and gaming, somewhere around **€600**. I’m looking for a **4K** monitor, but my previous purchase was the **ASUS ProArt Display PA278CGV**, which I was actually  happy with. Even though it’s only **2.5K**, I was ready to live with that — but for some reason, maybe because of the *crystalline effect* or something else, it felt extremely *blurry*, even compared to other 2.5K monitors I use at work. And, of course, it couldn’t compare to 4K at all.\n\nYesterday I received the **MSI MPG 274URDFW E16M**, and I’m a bit disappointed — mainly with the panel quality. The monitor has quite noticeable darkening along the edges and a brightness shift depending on the viewing angle, which creates a slight tunnel effect. On top of that, the overall build quality feels somewhat cheap.\n\nMy current monitor, the **LG 27UP85NP-W**, doesn’t have any of these image issues — but it’s only **60 Hz**. All I want is a monitor with *at least 120 Hz* and a *good IPS panel*.\n\nI realize that I might be asking for too much and that my requirements are quite specific — but the search goes on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nc78blpt70yf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d1c86f8edc4e03f644963f71c8af760099439d5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4yfdl9v70yf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97018cd130ec8ba0d7937efd73a1399ee69e912f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uongpggw70yf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ec2801f9025a417c5ee34b55b6116a24f8ea8a6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7q5zfz3x70yf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=256a73dce310264931d00e48bc61ce2ad5c0e314\n\n",

A simple search via VESA's website does not display this model (or family). I also reached out to Innocn's support, and they admitted it had not been certified. At least they were honest? In the conversation, they stated it is currently not in process either. \n\nHow common is it for monitors to actually get certified after it has already been released? I have only ever seen it prior to release.\n\nHow much does this actually matter?\n\nIs the process to get certified expensive? I know some of their other models do have certifications. \n\nI know monitors can still hit the spec,  just have not been officially certified, but it does not appear to be the case here. According to this video from China, if I am reading this correctly it would be unable to adhere to the spec anyway.

The power button is large and has a white led (not for everyone). The joystick is a decent size that makes it easy to use. The hdr is hdr10. That is customizable from both the windows hdr app and the command center software. \n\nThis monitor is very smooth. On max settings with no dlss in bo6 I am getting the smoothest most responsive game play that was noticable from my previous monitor (hyperx armada 25 240hz/1080p). \n\nThe detail and richness I got from both 8k hdr yt videos and marathon blew my mind. I spent a lot of my matches looking around at details.\nIt comes with dp, hdmi, power and usb b cable.\nIt does come with a adjustable stand but I have monitor arms.\n\nNeutral -  it is very understated, no gamery rgb or stands.  \n\nThe bad - it does have veey obvious glow. The screen is kind of dim in windows when not in hdr content. It's only 320hz and not 380+.\n\n\nOverall - I cannot believe for the price the experience I have with this monitor. It was like hearing music with quality audio but with gaming.

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters.

[P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "selftext": "(see my edit at the bottom)\n\nSince my one year anniversary of getting the AW3423DWF on a Black Friday deal last year was coming up I thought I'd throw some grey slides up to see how it was handling burn-in. Well... as you can see, not great. Unfortunately, now that I know it's there I'm seeing it all the time in dark scenes. I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.\n\nEdit: I have a theory as to why this burn-in was particularly bad in case other people read this post later. Yes, icons and wallpaper contributed, but others have mentioned that they haven't see such dramatic burn in even with those. Ever since I got this monitor I've been struggling to keep it in standby when not in use, despite having a 5 minute black screensaver and 10 minute standby. I would find it randomly awake and it wouldn't go back to sleep unless I forced it. I'd see it sleep and then immediately wake up, or walk away and come back to find it on. (I'm talking about the monitor, not PC).\n\nWell, I think I fixed it after finding another thread on this: **input auto-select needs to be turned off in the monitor menu**. For some reason it would keep it from sleeping properly. I just tried it and it worked perfectly and now immediately enters the pixel refresh like it's supposed to. I have a feeling that this bug was kicking it out of standby constantly and not letting it do a refresh every four hours, despite being set to. That would have definitely made burn in worse if it was only doing it at night when I shut the PC off and not during the day.\n\nNo idea if this is the smoking gun, but it likely contributed.",

    "selftext": "(see my edit at the bottom)\n\nSince my one year anniversary of getting the AW3423DWF on a Black Friday deal last year was coming up I thought I'd throw some grey slides up to see how it was handling burn-in. Well... as you can see, not great. Unfortunately, now that I know it's there I'm seeing it all the time in dark scenes. I haven't gamed in a while and pulled up Alan Wake 2 and there it is.\n\nNormally I do a lot of mixed viewing, but lately it's been sitting on the desktop more than usual. It also seems to have this weird quirk where it constantly wakes out of standby and just sits on if I don't turn fully turn it off, so I'm sure that contributed. It seems to hate wanting to sleep or allow a black screen saver. I ran a manual panel refresh and pixel refresh and it made no difference.\n\nOh well, time to see how well the warranty holds up!\n\nAnyone prefer going through Dell or Best Buy? Since it was on a large discount I added on the four year Geek Squad coverage and thinking it may be easier just to bring it down there and swap same day rather than the headache of Dell.\n\nEdit: I have a theory as to why this burn-in was particularly bad in case other people read this post later. Yes, icons and wallpaper contributed, but others have mentioned that they haven't see such dramatic burn in even with those. Ever since I got this monitor I've been struggling to keep it in standby when not in use, despite having a 5 minute black screensaver and 10 minute standby. I would find it randomly awake and it wouldn't go back to sleep unless I forced it. I'd see it sleep and then immediately wake up, or walk away and come back to find it on. (I'm talking about the monitor, not PC).\n\nWell, I think I fixed it after finding another thread on this: **input auto-select needs to be turned off in the monitor menu**. For some reason it would keep it from sleeping properly. I just tried it and it worked perfectly and now immediately enters the pixel refresh like it's supposed to. I have a feeling that this bug was kicking it out of standby constantly and not letting it do a refresh every four hours, despite being set to. That would have definitely made burn in worse if it was only doing it at night when I shut the PC off and not during the day.\n\nNo idea if this is the smoking gun, but it likely contributed.",

    "selftext": "Hi Everyone. I bought the Asus Rog Strix XG27UCDMG (27Inch 4K 240hz QD OLED) about 2 weeks ago and i have another 2 to make a decision if im going to keep it or send it back. So far im really happy with it but i just cant seem to decide if i made the right decision going with the 27inch screen (Buyers remorse as always) Everything is so smooth and crispy but i just keep reading online comments about missing out on the immersion of a 32inch screen and \"wasting the performance drop for a 27inch screen\". Im just asking if someone else has tried both and which one was the \"correct choice\". I know that PPD is more important than PPI but i do sit fairly close to the monitor. I just feel like its not as immersive as i thought it would. The 32Inch that id be going for would be the PG32UCDM. ",

    "selftext": "I got the Topping DX5 II a couple of months ago, and now got around to ordering some feet so that I can stack it on top of the High-Amp Antares. Feet are cheapish metal \"isolation\" spikes. Those were the nicest looking solution for getting the necessary ventilation clearance between the two amps.\n\nThe DX5 II is a really neat little box full of features and with all the power I need. Moved the previous Topping E50/L50 stack to my study. No need for any other DAC/amps until something breaks.\n\nThe Antares is for my Stax and the hopefully soon repaired Sennheiser HE-60. More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800. My impression is that it does something pleasing to the staging and shaves off most of the micro details, which can be relaxing depending on the mood and music. Despite recommendations it is  not good with the HD580 which, to me, already lacks resolution. Need to set up an A/B comparison one of these days to see if I am just imagining things. \n\nHeadphones are Stax Lambda Nova Basic, which I got for cheap with one of the utter crap Stay entry level amps.",

    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n→ Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n→ Punchy bass.  \n→ Delicious female vocals.  \n→ Soundstage above average.  \n→ No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n→ DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n→ If you are a purist, stay away.  \n→ Mids somewhat soft.  \n→ Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30€/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a “more and better.”\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:** present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:** this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:** here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:** somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:** maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:** with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:** substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:** too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:** I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:** at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:** placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:** keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:** could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:** testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko’s character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos’ voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:** testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once… I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:** dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:** not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:** paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:** I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it’s unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that “I’m going to make you have fun” vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/hzhh291a74yf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1330b369663156fd2593bc89c456bd2a8ca3e1fb\n\nHi everyone:\n\nI used both the QCC Pro and BTD700 dongles to test various codecs (aptX, aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC) and noticed some distortion in the high frequencies—especially with piano tracks. This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don’t have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn’t test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can’t go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle — I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would’ve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn’t have a mobile app, but there’s one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn’t update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they’re very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side — the QCC Pro’s mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro’s design but prefer the BTD700’s price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they’re an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey’re extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I’m very sensitive — even picky — about anything pressing on my head (I can’t stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw’s traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft — genuinely reminiscent of Hermès leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Hermès bags, you’ll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn’t mean they’re not good for solo performances — I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it’s more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced — I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water… and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2flmc5e914yf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=70db2ea529ba5f5b1230ac28b4d91c7ec2cfedce\n\nSo, I want to talk about DACs. Personally, I’m not a believer in all that snake oil — people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don’t buy it. And honestly, I don’t think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I’ve always thought that if there’s any difference, it’s basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time — I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a “bigger soundstage,” I just assume it’s because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I’m open-minded — I’ll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that’s matched, everything else — bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging — sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I’m out. Either they’re trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don’t. In either case, their opinions don’t mean much to me anymore, because I can’t hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let’s talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn’t tell exactly what at first, but it didn’t feel like my imagination. After more testing — switching headphones, replaying the same tracks — I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head — especially those higher notes — in a way the K7 doesn’t. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that’s somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it’s like their voice locks into one spot — more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** — and I can’t believe I’m saying this — it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you — same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat’s not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer’s right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste — some benefit from that extra space, some don’t. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** — *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn’t huge, but it’s there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It’s actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it’s slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less “exciting.” The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah — I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It’s pricey, and there’s no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat’s my honest take.",

    "title": "Suggestion for next best headphone? Moving on from JBL.",
    "selftext": "So I previously had upgraded from some generic brand headphones to the JBL Quantum One's. They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

Nano’s bass sounded overdone Sort of similar to how the AirPods Pro 3 sounded, like it was too V-shaped. I prefer a neutral headphone with a slight V-emphasis. I don’t understand why the Nano would present the bass in this way given everyone has said it’s a neutral headphone. Can this bass be EQ’d?\n\nThe XS sounded perfect, but the Ananda Nano sounded a bit boomy. But on every other track, the bass sounded tight and great, and there was just more separation and overall clarity on the Ananda Nano. But people kept saying it's like an analytical, dry headphone.

    "selftext": "*TL:DR for those who are short on time or not willing to read the full review:*\n\n# Pros:\n\n* Overall versatile and non-fatiguing signature that will work well for most people\n* Comfortable to wear and pretty sturdy considering that they’re mostly made of plastic\n* Come with a coiled wire that’s a very appreciated thing for those who DJ\n* The ANC isn’t up to par with more mainstream bluetooth headphones but it’s still decent enough considering the price\n* Strong electronic noise-cancellation when using the microphone\n* Good battery life \n* Multipoint bluetooth\n\n# Cons:\n\n* The fit is very inconsistent and leads to differences in sound that depend on how the headphones fit on the head and ears of the listener\n* The RGB lighting is for gamers, the overall style is for DJs, and the bluetooth connectivity is not used by neither of these types of users: the product is rather confusing\n* Hard to use outdoor: very specific DJ design and the ANC produces some occasional pops because of street bumps/potholes (if you commute)\n* No AptX/LDAC\n* The strong noise cancellation of the microphone is welcomed in very busy environments but it’s very aggressive and sometimes cuts some parts of the voice\n\n# ————————————————————————————\n\n# Introduction\n\nKiwi Ears is a very popular brand in the Chi-Fi industry for their IEMs, but lately they have been entering the over-ear space with some cans. In this review, I’ll be speaking about the Kiwi Ears Ardor, a pair of Wireless Over Ear headphones with ANC capabilities and sold for a competitive listing price.\n\n>*Disclaimer: the Kiwi Ears Aventus were sent to me by Kiwi Ears so that I could write an honest review.

The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn’t seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90°C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don’t cheap when clicked since there’s enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more “premium” (but that’s just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn’t have the chance to test the full 45  hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone’s bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren’t objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it’s pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven’t experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you’ll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you’re not getting Bose-like ANC you’re still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I’m on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn’t emphasize things too much making them almost “artificial” and I think it’s definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn’t low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you’re playing games and want a wireless set, I don’t think this is the right one, it’s just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don’t even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven’t encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let’s talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you’re going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review. \n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it’s there in the right quantity with average speed. It’s not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don’t hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn’t rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren’t fatiguing and they never become hot, and I’d say that they’re not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn’t fatiguing but there’s some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some “S” sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don’t really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn’t very spacious, but it’s okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I’d say but no true bad words to spend here either. \n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I’d say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I’d say it’s usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons: \n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of “inconsistent” sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they’re performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it’s the smarter choice between the two if you don’t wanna charge it as frequently as you’d do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that’s objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it’s a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not “bad” per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren’t big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it’s more of a “perceived” clarity” up top but it doesn’t really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I’d say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

I use it to drive my hd660s2 as well but I’m not sure if it would handle it well. My intuition told me the sound needs to be amplified as it’s a little lack of brightness but I also saw someone saying it’s just the sound signature of this headphone.

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Ω) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Ω), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

    "selftext": "***TL;DR:*** *Yes, they're that good. For me they hit all the sweet spots with ideal compromises for the price/package. The best ANC/Wireless/BT headphone I have heard. I think they deserve the hype in their neutral / out-of-the-box EQ. They cherry pick lots of great qualities and bundle them into a class defining package. I am happy they hit the price point they do. They feel made with love and care for anyone that loves high quality sound. They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

My analogy was that you can never tune a Honda civic to be a Ferrari. I was trying to explain why $1000+ headphones exist and he was like couldn’t you just eq a decent pair to sound almost the exact same. My response boiled down to “no?”\n\nI’m also team no eq btw. Mostly bc it can take a lot of dedicated time and I don’t want to unintentionally make things sound worse yk.\n\nEDIT: I get that eq is generally more for tweaking you headphones to your preference. But i’m more trying to answer his question of why can’t you eq to sound near identical to another (probably having the same driver type for speed)",

Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

Now, just disregard audio quality completely. I'm just talking noise cancelling with ANC. How is it that airpod pro 3s beat the xm5 in noise cancellation with ANC on? I mean thats what the graph shows - much higher attentuation dBs for the APP3s compared to the XM5s. They do fizzle out near the high pitched end but im guessing that overears even without ANC are better in blocking out high freq noise because of the build material and clamping over ears. Seems like ANC doesnt make much of a difference for XM5s anyways on the high end. So my question is that ive seen all over the internet that overears + anc are always better than wireless earbuds (air pods). Why is this case different? Or am i a total idiot and i dont understand the graphs or the context. ",

I was prepared to spend $2000. But I've decided to take my money elsewhere where I would at least be treated like I wasn't some annoying customer.\n\nTo the owners, managers, stakeholders of A2A, you guys may sell some pretty good stuff. But the lousy service at your outlets will be the reason you lose customers. Your Google reviews are flooded by others who share the same sentiment.

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/it1hxzzqlrxf1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=5912a58e06d71ad339cda4f905209e4b1052edb0\n\nI compared a few headphones a couple of days ago, and a lot of people wanted to hear more about the Edition XV. So let’s talk about it.\n\nAmong all the headphones I’ve listened to, the closest one might be the Fiio FT1 Pro. The moment I put the Edition XV on, I instantly felt this warmth spreading through me — like being wrapped in honey. You’ll know what I mean once you try it.\n\n**Bass (before & after eq using oratory 1990's, the EQ didn't change the conclusion below)**\n\nThe most distinctive thing about the Edition XV, to my ears, is its **meaty bass**. It’s thick, elastic, and feels like it’s hugging the sides of your ears. It’s not the fast, clean kind of bass you get from the HE600. It’s the wet, creamy kind — like your ears are being gently massaged with a cloth soaked in oil.\n\nThe bass also has more layers than the FT1 Pro, but the FT1 Pro’s bass FEELS more aggressive. It’s like a scholar delivering an insult — refined, yet every word cuts deep. There’s more nuance and subtlety here, unlike the FT1 Pro, which just lashes out bluntly. Naturally, this makes the Edition XV sound a bit less aggressive at first. But if you listen closely, the impact is still there — it just feels smoother and more full-bodied.\n\nThat said, not everyone listens critically all the time. When I’m just relaxing, I sometimes *feel* like the FT1 Pro has more bass (even though that’s not actually true if you listen critically when A/B them). I just want to bring this up because sometimes people would only describe stuff in their critical listening sessions, but headphones could feel VERY  different in daily casual listening.\n\n**Mids**\n\nNow, the mids. Vocals on the Edition XV are closer and more intimate than typical Hifiman models like the Arya Stealth or Edition XS, but still a bit farther away than on the FT1 Pro. The voice is rich, full, and slightly nasal. For female vocals, the singer can sound about ten years older than she actually is. That’s not necessarily good or bad — it’s all down to taste.\n\nThe vocals lean on the darker side. Compared to the FT1 Pro, they’re more refined but also smoother — which means you lose some of that raw texture in the voice, like the growls in the rock music. Personally, I prefer the FT1 Pro’s vocal texture; it carries more emotion like anger or passion. The Arya Stealth also feels more emotional than the Edition XV, but for a different reason — it has more treble, more air, and that shimmer in the highs makes the vocals feel alive and vibrant. (You know those highs that vibrate with your skulls?)\n\nStill, the Edition XV has its own charm. A lot of 80s and 90s tracks — songs like city pop — take on a totally different vibe here. In fact, I’d describe the Edition XV as a **vibe** in itself. You know those days when you’re tired of all the crap and just want to chill, wrapped in a soft blanket, hugging a pillow? That’s what the Edition XV feels like. It won’t shock you, it won’t thrill you — it just gives you that warm, steady, safe harbor you want to come home to.\n\n**Treble**\n\nThe treble is soft — no sibilance, no sting. The FT1 Pro is more exciting in this area, which is why I think it’s the better all-rounder. The Edition XV, though, owns its signature mood completely.\n\n**Others**\n\nAs for soundstage — the Edition XV’s lateral stage is narrower than its front-to-back depth. Sometimes the sound on both sides feels smeared onto a flat plane beside your ears, kind of vibrating there, which feels a bit unnatural. The FT1 Pro’s stage is even smaller, but it doesn’t have that issue.\n\nOverall, the Edition XV definitely has better detail retrieval and imaging than the FT1 Pro.\n\n**I wouldn't use a \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this headphone, since it is so special in the Hifiman lineup that I don't think there is any other hifiman headphone that can be compared with it. It is its own vibe, and if you can vibe with it, then it can probably beat those far more expensive headphones for you. If you can't (for example, you really enjoy other Hifiman lineups), it's really hard to say if you would enjoy it as much as others do.**\n\nHere is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1odsod7/comparison_between_he600_edition_xv_edition_xs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from a couple of days ago if you want to know more about my preference in sounds.",

    "selftext": "\nThe Hifiman Arya stealth are absurdly good for the price I got them at. At just below 500 dollars it’s the Ultimate endgame headphone for me. \n\nThe comfort is very nice. The headband does not create any hotspots. The build quality is underwhelming for the price but expected since it’s Hifiman. \n\nI upgraded from the Hd560s. While The Arya stealth’s do sound better overall. Do they sound nearly 300 dollars better? Not necessarily but it’s a definite upgrade. The soundstage is much wider and the instrument separation is just so good on well mixed tracks. I was also considering the edition XS. I decided to go with the Arya because I just wanted to exit the hobby and 500 dollars seemed the price point that was right. \n\nThe sound profile is really nice aswell. The bass is very present and not rolled off so it’s very immersive. The mids are a bit recessed which makes sense because you needed that soundstage to come from somewhere. The treble is on the bright side but it isn’t too bad. I do plan on EQing them later on to make them sound a bit warmer. They already do with the FiiO k11 R2R. If you like your vocals to be forwards than these headphones aren’t for you unfortunately. \n\nHowever, because the treble is a bit high. Beware when you play songs that are terribly mastered or mixed. They will scrape your ear drums. They are much better headphones if modern pop is your thing but if you like Rock or classical than these are S tier headphones for that. \n\nOverall, Superb value for the money and I can’t wait to see what I can do with these EQ wise. When it comes from my end game, these will do for now. Maybe later in life I’ll upgrade but I know diminishing returns hit really hard after this so it’s a matter until I have some cash ready to burn. \n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Have been using my speakers as my main listening mode lately but this past week or so I’ve been gravitating toward my desktop set up over my stereo for digital listening. My set is: \n\n• Grado RS2x \n• HiFiman Subdara (2020)\n• Schiit Vali 2++\n• Schiit Modi\n\nI’ve had the Grados for a couple of years now and every time I use them it reminds me why i got into this “hobby” in the first place. Absolutely gorgeous in the mid range and with a little EQ (+3db at 100hz) the bass feels a bit more full. What floors me about the RS2x’s is how natural instruments sound with them. Jazz, rock—pretty much anything with actual instruments sounds incredible. Having used Grados ever since I got a pair of SR-60s in high school, I can’t imagine a headphone I would enjoy more than these. They’re far from neutral but if you like the way they color music Grados are some of the best cans. After 15+ years of experience with their headphones I feel like I have “arrived” with these and my modest budget audiophile set up. \n\nThe HiFimans are a delight as well. Far more neutral, but man can they be EQed. No distortion with any level of reasonable EQ on the bass so if I want to put on some electronic music and blast some chunky thick bass directly into my brain, these are the cans to do it. While I definitely use the Grados more, these are an amazing second set to have at my desk for when I listen to music that the Grados aren’t well suited for. (Not that other music sounds /bad/ on them, it’s just not what they excel at.)\n\nNone of my friends are big into audio and they’ve heard me rant about my cans probably more times they can count so I thought I’d dump my thoughts and adoration of my set up here. \n\nFeel free to share your desktop set up’s as well I’d love to see what other people are working with, gear-wise. \n",

    "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn’t hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don’t want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\\-Pros  \n\\>The most comfortable set I’ve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n\\-Cons:  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn’t stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65€**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn’t have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle… but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let’s look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn’t have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone’s auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn’t tangle, and doesn’t pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don’t know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn’t find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn’t fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone’s intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn’t the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn’t interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don’t feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don’t need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors’ tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don’t know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can’t believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\n\n\nNow let’s talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn’t be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos’ very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn’t the highest resolution experience I’ve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let’s go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it’s the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn’t the best for purists since listening wasn’t fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don’t want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I’ve tested. At least up to the **100€/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what’s the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn’t perfect. In fact, technically, it’s inferior to two other competitors in its price range I’ve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I’m not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn’t hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you’ve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

    "title": "Myer Audio SLIIVO SL224 Earphones Review",
    "selftext": "I didn't expect much from Myer Audio, and I didn't really follow their work. The CKLVX D62 model is still popular, although it gets a lot more attention than it really deserves, I think; the SL41 MK2 one was excellent, but the next few models didn't seem to stand out in the stream of endless Chinese specialties.\n\nTherefore, I approached the next model, SLIIVO SL224, with minimum expectations. My loss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij95o9whopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c35707a8bb0ad7bea5154dacf5740c96e62d49\n\nToday, we'll talk about SLIIVO SL224, in-ear headphones priced at $285 (as of October 2025).\n\n# All but the sound\n\nThe earphones are delivered in a cardboard box, normal-sized for the earphones of this price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46te32ckopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaf049b747a3e2612525251c1f342557f1e6e261\n\nIn the box, we can find the earphones themselves, a round leather case, 7 pairs of eartips, and a cable with replaceable connectors. No surprises.\n\nThe cable is beautiful, nice, with a resistance of 0.3 Ohms. The connectors are inserted and fixed to the cable with coarse-threaded nuts. This approach feels reliable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yq7y8nlopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e39369d65e608cae16450636cf618925bd366a2c\n\nIn addition to the 3.5 and 4.4 mm connectors, a Type-C connector was also included, which, of course, is not a connector at all, but a DAC. The DAC works exclusively in 16-bit/48 kHz mode, in Plug'n'play mode, with standard drivers in Windows 11, if nothing else. There are no special drivers on the [manufacturer's website](https://myeraudio.com/) (however, the website looks like it's being barely maintained, to put it mildly). The Walk Play app doesn't see it. But thanks for including it anyway.\n\nThere are 3 pairs of slightly tighter silicone eartips of a standard shape, sizes S, M and L...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xtkizhnopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1d969d57be38137156ba8de6bb85674f71f3ff\n\n...3 more pairs of slightly softer silicone eartips...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w63t0snoopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20fc14caa0167803e16403be6c068333bf719521\n\n...as well as 1 pair of foam ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy6v1cxpopxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cca6a13136ec2ef430ce9374cb05ea4469a0a812\n\nThe earphones themselves are technically made on the basis of a menagerie of 2 dynamic (6 and 10 mm), 2 armature and 4 microplanar drivers, or a total of 8 drivers in each earphone. Each of the driver types plays back lower, middle, and upper frequencies, respectively.\n\nThe earphones' enclosures are made of polymer resin and have a pronounced relief, that is, ergonomic depressions and projections.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfydif6ropxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e22a05e4a02671e7249bbe0040085de8fcb5d1\n\nThe radius of the metal part of the sound guide is 6.25 mm. in the thick end part and 5.55 in the main part.\n\nThe outer inserts are made of natural mother-of-pearl placed under a layer of transparent plastic. Mother-of-pearl mysteriously shimmers in the light, and small defects only emphasize the natural origin of the material and are not noticeable in reality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uo0fwmj7ruxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4057aa4590b0ca2e33a8365e4e610daf0a21b1b8\n\nThe connector pad is flat, it is slightly recessed into the housing. The compensation hole is covered with a plastic grate fused into the housing.\n\nThe earphones are designed for an average depth of the fit and have standard diameters of sound ducts by modern standards, so you can experiment with eartips at great length and with abandon: SpinFit CP100+, Pentaconn COREIR, Roseselsa SoundCocoon, Divinus Prism Wide Bore – [they all](https://boizoff.com/eartips_part_4/) fit and let you comfortably place the earphones in your ears. I never managed to settle on anything specific, as they all are fine.\n\nI can't say anything bad about SL224 in terms of user experience and ergonomics – they're just well-made modern in-ear headphones without any pitfalls. Of course, their black polished plastic surface scratches quickly and collects fingerprints, but that's how 99% of all headphones are made now, so there's nothing we can do. I can also complain about the case: for the earphones of this size and the cable of this length and thickness, this case is frankly small. Give me a bigger one now!\n\nAs for the electrical characteristics, the manufacturer claims a resistance of 36 Ω and a sensitivity of 108 dB. I can't comment on the second value, but I've recently become able to measure resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vktmk7topxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0087afee237e878d735e0bae6214e181dd579035\n\nIt varies from 34 to 14 Ω.\n\n# The sound\n\n*Standard links:*\n\n1. *the description of my rig is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/renovation-of-my-measuring-rig-for-headphones/)*;*\n2. *the audiogram of my hearing is* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/audiogram/)*;*\n3. *articles on measurement theory and the whole shebang are* [*here*](https://boizoff.com/language/en/category/audiophile/theory/)*.*\n\nFrequency response of SLIIVO SL224 earphones with original foam eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hfl2191ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cea47660d534a586276350a062dc957e1a569d4\n\nAnd, before analyzing the frequency response, let me remind you that this frequency response will strongly depend on the depth of the fit. Frequency response of SL224 for the second resonance at 7000, 7500, 8000 and 8500 Hz:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lbyhjm2ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb404456030ce4a4c3f442905acc9d1c7a41284\n\nNote that there is no simple displacement of the resonant peak. On the contrary, the entire range from 3 to 20 kHz changes significantly, and only the emphasis at 12 kHz remains more or less stable in terms of volume and 'width', so to speak. The key thing that can be seen from these graphs is that the deeper the earphones are placed in the auditory canals, the lower the area before the second resonance 'droops' and the higher the peak rises around 15 kHz.\n\nComparison of frequency response for original foam and silicone eartips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg8uwbu4ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c2be14aaa3c3c99ba0cf535c6d00c6b7b3175bc\n\nAnyway, we can see the following on the graphs:\n\n* it seems to be a more or less typical sound delivery a la Harman;\n* but with reduced subbass;\n* and with a 'muffled', but rather 'smooth' 4-10 kHz segment;\n* as well as with an expansion after 10 kHz, the nature of which depends on the eartips. The graph obtained when using silicone eartips is more valid for my ears.\n\nBesides, consider a slight rise in the bass, about 250 Hz, as well as the shape of the 600 Hz to 3 kHz segment – it’s almost linear. We'll talk below how this affects the SL224 sound perception.\n\nNonlinear distortion at 94 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g2c9x48ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=031fd6a69ca193c02a48b3996e51ed689a3e213e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrc4ao19ppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3afce27b77c8e94f80bfa77f522bdc0e82f1eec\n\nNonlinear distortion at 104 dB with the 'Use harmonic frequency as ref' option turned off and on:\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_1.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_1.jpg)\n\n[https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_THD\\_104\\_2.jpg](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_THD_104_2.jpg)\n\nThere's not much to comment on here: at 94 dB, the distortion is just over 0.5% at the maximum; at 104 dB volume, it's over 1%. That is, they have no audible effect on the sound.\n\nMinimum phase response, group delay, and spectrogram in the 'Burst decay' mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxxdhfdppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbabddd9448e7feaa7bfba5bd9e255749fba11db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfq42o6eppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258891b29d856b4a4102a1ee88176893e93ffc2b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jadpkhseppxf1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e62b9f7e963ddeb411d1c3629b85179cc9f17a3\n\nIt's a common near-ideal pattern, typical for all modern in-ears of a similar price.\n\nMy subjective evaluation is that I'm blown away primarily by how full-fledged the SL224 sound delivery turned out to be. And I deliberately don't use the word 'balanced' because it refers to the concept of neutrality. Literally everything in the sound of these earphones is in place. All frequencies are exactly in the amount that my ear personally expects. There is a very, very weighty, but technical subbass, a 'close' articulated middle with a hearing-friendly range at about 6-8 kHz, and an airy lightness after 10 kHz. It's very difficult to describe this sound because it's 'correct' and 'tasty' at the same time. In other words, you definitely won't be able to complain about tonal inaccuracy as it's at a very high level, but you also have this feeling of a 'spectacular' sound. It's difficult for me to clearly connect this with measurement graphs, but I assume that it's the linear range of 600-3000 Hz (and here we can move on to an endless debate about how to correctly combine frequency response graphs for comparison), as well as some emphasis on ultra-high frequencies that speak for themselves.\n\nA standalone interesting quality of these earphones, which I really appreciate and which is relatively rare, is the instrument sound separation. It's just splendid. You can listen to each vocal line, percussion, each component of the track separately and distinguish its perception from the overall musical flow.\n\nMoreover, the width of the sound stage is clearly larger than average. SL224 play in a large-scale, airy manner, and the recording space noticeably lives and breathes. The music plays 'around your head' and even more or less from behind rather than between your ears.\n\nAs one would expect with such sound delivery, these earphones are very versatile in terms of suitable musical content. The only limitation, apart from your taste, is the quality of tracks. If a sound engineer has been careful about recording and processing of the high frequency area, everything will be fine. If they haven't, you will be hearing weird and unpleasant things.\n\n# Comparisons\n\nIf we compare within the price category, guided by the [best online rating of in-ear monitors](https://boizoff.com/language/en/the-best-iems/), then the following models will be next to SL224:\n\n* PULA ANVIL 114\n* Letshuoer Cadenza 4\n* Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite.\n\nI have compared them, of course, up-close and personal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1p7xn3ippxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934c4bb516dc35126dc0ced23e9d82aefefd3ec\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to ANVIL 114: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_ANVIL114.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_ANVIL114.png)\n\nWhen A/B-ing, ANVIL 114 fully justify their name, hitting the listener's ears with a steel hammer: this is a massive, 'fat' sound supported by a bone conduction driver against the rather neutral, 'elegant' SL224 sound delivery.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Cadenza 4: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Cadenza\\_4.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Cadenza_4.png)\n\nCadenza 4 are an example of excellent 'light' headphones. Compared to SL224, they have more 'top' and less 'bottom' in almost identical proportions. The Cadenza 4's sound delivery is 'airier', lighter, 'sparklier', and they have a slightly smoother section after 10 kHz, while SL224, again, are more neutral and, therefore, more versatile in comparison.\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Orchestra Lite: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Orchestra\\_Lite.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Orchestra_Lite.png)\n\nWe love Orchestra Lite for their infinitely expressive 'middle'. It seems that Orchestra Lite deliver sound even 'closer' to the listener, and they're a little brighter if we evaluate the sound delivery by and large, but SL224 win in terms of reliability and 'punch'.\n\nIf we look at the SL224 tuning conceptually, so to speak, then we need to compare them with completely different earphones – [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/) and [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78vvvipppxf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ca90c5ee84b8406929c106d0d5555ef26ddc5b\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Meteor: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Meteor.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Meteor.png)\n\nFrequency response of SL224 compared to Mega5-EST: [https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224\\_Mega5-EST.png](https://boizoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SL224_Mega5-EST.png)\n\nAll three graphs compared:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mna3exppxf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65aac9b4a17b9c969bac7fa6de31bcb38d5dc526\n\nCompared to Meteor, SL224 have a weightier bass and subbass due to a less pronounced middle; the Meteor sound seems sterile and faded against SL224. And, compared to Mega5-EST SL224, on the contrary, they're slightly less bassy, and the midrange is more pronounced. By ear, the SL224's sound delivery is almost perfectly equidistant from the tunings of these two models. The only thing that SL224 don't have is a smooth (by ear) frequency response after 10 kHz, which competitors can boast of. SL224 deliver this segment clearer, but less accurate. But prices vary accordingly, too.\n\nThe only aspect where I can name the best option for less money is gaming: from a positioning point of view, [KBEAR Cepheus](https://boizoff.com/language/en/kbear-cepheus-earphones-review/) remain unattainable and subjectively the best headphones for competitive games. But SL224 are also quite good in this context, don't get me wrong.\n\n# Summary\n\nI believe that the SL224's entry into the market is a significant milestone in the modern headphone industry. The SL224 is as iconic a model as [Moondrop Meteor](https://boizoff.com/language/en/moondrop-meteor-earphones-review/), [EPZ K9](https://boizoff.com/language/en/epz-k9-earphones-review/) or [Hisenior Mega5-EST](https://boizoff.com/language/en/hisenior-mega5-est-earphones-review-living-classics/) in their categories.\n\nAs for the sound… I'm willing to pay to see the first reaction to the SL224 sound of someone for whom these earphones will be the first or second under the sun, as the wow effect from their first listening is so intense, and they differ so much from 'just headphones' and any TWS. SL224 are tuned just superbly: their sound delivery is simultaneously engaging, especially if you turn up the volume, but also reliable and large-scale in the sense of a virtual sound stage.\n\nWho won't like them? 'Bassheads' and fans of listening to music in the conditions of high ambient noise, that is, on the streets of a big city (noise masking will reduce the sound of these headphones to medium and high frequencies only).\n\nTo buy or not to buy? To buy!",

    "selftext": "So, in the \"I'm Exploring the World\" column, I decided to listen to something other than electrostatic there must be other headphones out there, right?\n\nI thought I should try a TOTL of dynamic and planar headphones.\n\nSo, I found the\n\n* Sennheiser HD800/HD800S\n* and Focal Utopia 2022\n* and Hifiman Susvara OG\n\nLet's start with the Hifiman Susvara. Well, they need a very powerful amplifier. Very powerful. 1 watt per channel isn't enough. These are some of the most difficult headphones to amplify. Proper amplification. Overall, they have a good sound quality, detailing is about on par with the Stax 009, but a bit lacking. But they have good bass.\n\nNext, the Sennheiser HD800. I was pleasantly surprised that my DACs drove them easily, even though they're 300 ohms. They have a pleasant sound with a good soundstage. They're not as good as TOTL electrostatic in in high-frequency transparency and precision, but they're cheap and don't need an es amp. Overall, they're good headphones for the money. The HD800S are also good, only better. And the Focal Utopia 2022 - I guess some people like that kind of sound.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my journey through this world of headphones. I'd certainly like to hear the top-end Sony R10s or something like the Spirit Torino Valkyria and there are plenty of planar headphones out there..",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I am having some problems with the sound on my Aune AR5000, and would like some advice.\n\nA lot of people say that the sound on the Aune AR5000 is great and they typically don't mention any problems with it. However, I am experiencing some extremely harsh, sharp and painful kind of sibilance to some vocals on some tracks. For example from 1:43-1:55 on Duckworth by Kendrick Lamar. This happens mostly on s-sounds.\n\nI found that I had to meticulously EQ around 9800 Hz (q factor of 3), reducing it by around 6-7 dB in order to get rid of this painful sound. However, I find that doing this makes the overall sound more dull, dark and less defined. I'm not sure what to do. Measurement of the AR5000's frequency response shows a big peak at around 9500 Hz, could this perhaps be why? I did not see Resolve mention this problem in his review of the headphones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/undw3zt1kpxf1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c527c80ede8fe7708253b26ec1c84e2adf4e1f8\n\nI have a pair of airpods pro 2 that i have no problems with. No painful sharp vocals.\n\nIs this a common problem among people? And is having to perform such a big EQ change even acceptable?  \nAm i experiencing this because I have a weird HRTF?  \nPerhaps any owners of the AR5000 that can give their thoughts and experience with this?",

    "title": "In the market: DCA Noire XO or E3?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI know the question is odd since it's a open vs closed back DCA, however I am in the market for a new set. For my listening tastes, my 6XX doesn't cut it. I then got a planar FT1 Pro and the widened soundstage is nice, but I hate certain aspects of the headphones (including the stock pads and putting on some Dekoni LCD-type pads certainly changed the headphones too much) and I find it really sounds bad when I drive them with EQ that brings it closer to Harman. The dips I can hear in 2K-5K is very annoying to try and EQ properly and I haven't been able to make it right with the new pads; they're either distant or very grating.\n\nConversly, I noticed that once I tuned my 6XX's close to Harman using ortary's EQ, I vastly enjoyed the sound more, but the technical aspects of the 6XX's were starting to bug me, like the lack of Impact of bass and the narrow soundstage,\n\nHence my look into DCA's more Harman tuned headphones. I have heard very good things about E3, namely that it has a vast sound-stage for a closed back, large drivers/earcups (I do have a big fuggin head), etc. etc. However, now that I see that the Noire XO is out for several hundred less, I am also looking at these, namely on DMS' recommendation and his bit about \"if you LPF after 10k, you effectively get E3\". Pair the Noire XO's promising looking bass response, I am at a bit of a decision paralysis between the two for an end-game desktop setup.\n\nSo, for people that have listened to one or the other, is the E3 worth it for the extra money vs the Noire XO in your own personal opinion? What about for someone like myself that wants a more Harman tuned, wider soundstage headphone? It's one thing to say \"has a wide soundstage for a closed back\", but then how does it compare to an actual open back in the Noire XO?\n\nThanks! :)\n\ne; I also don't live anywhere near a place to test each.",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Impressions",
    "selftext": "Let me start off with the included dongle. I echo the thoughts of others when listening to the HDB 630s using the BTD 700--even at the highest performance protocol (as confirmed in the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus app), the cans do not sound as good as when connected via USB-C. The sound literally seems grainy when playing over the dongle. I will spend some more time later trying to figure out what may be the cause, but even when it's on AptX Adaptive and the phone/dongle are in my hands with the cans on my head, the sound is grainy. So with that all said, the rest of my impressions are with the cans playing over USB-C.\n\nMoving over to the HDB 630s themselves...\n\nFirst off, the Crossfeed function (set to Low) is excellent. It does not have any adverse effects on tonality or detail extraction, but imaging is significantly more natural and nuanced with this on. Just on this alone, I would choose these cans over my HD 6XX or my AirPods Max, as well as preferring these cans over any of my IEMs (when the weather is nice and cool). Overall, in my opinion, the Crossfeed function does more for imaging than having open backs like the HD 6XX.\n\nFor overall tonality, I am extremely pleased with the default tuning, and feel no need whatsoever to apply any (P)EQ adjustments. The HDB 630, for me, perfectly make up for the soft bass of HD 6XX without any detriment to the rest of the frequency range. Tuning is just right. Compared to AirPods Max, I would argue that bass on the HDB 630 (over USB-C) is more natural and balanced than AirPods Max, which has more punch, but at times the bass can seem a bit exaggerated--not so for me with HDB 630, bass tuning is just right. On the mids and highs, it is no contest, I'll take HDB 630 or HD 6XX every single time over AirPods Max. It's simply another level of transparency and natural sound. Between HD 6XX and HDB 630, I'm happy with either, as the difference is highly nuanced. There is only a slightly greater hint of air with HD 6XX, but the difference is far from night and day.\n\nNow let's talk about the ANC, transparency, and wind filtering. First of all with full ANC forced, I'd rate the ANC effectiveness a 7/10. It's fine. It's not the best. The best I've seen is AirPods Pro 3, followed by AirPods Max, followed by AirPods Pro 2. Actually, the best ANC I've ever experienced was wearing listening to AirPods Pro 3 with ANC on, simultaneously with a pair of AirPods Max worn over them with ANC on (yes, seriously)--but I digress, we're here to talk about HDB 630. Transparency mode forced full on without wind filtering enabled works okay, I'd rate it maybe a 7/10 if the wind noises don't get to you; however, they get to me. Now if you're indoors and turn on wind filtering, it improves Transparency mode performance probably to 8/10 (with AirPods of any kind still being the king). However...once you go outdoors to a noisy environment, like, say, Center City Philadelphia, things fall off a cliff. The wind filtering seems to detect all sorts of non-wind-noises as wind, and ends up basically turning Transparency mode into ANC mode (it is trying to block sounds that are not wind, and end up just blocking everything). Turning off wind filtering outdoors is also basically unusable--due to actual wind noise. So ironically, Transparency mode outdoors is really not great as a whole, maybe 5/10. Indoors it works fine, 7/10. I think of all the HDB 630's isolation features, the ANC with wind filtering on is probably the most effective at doing what it's supposed to do. Finally I don't understand Adaptive mode for ANC, it didn't appear to perform any differently than simply having ANC maxed out. Unlike on Apple AirPods, with Adaptive ANC mode turned on, when I start talking, it doesn't adapt to me and change to Transparency so that I can have a conversation with other people. The Apple stuff works stunningly well for this.\n\nFinally, the Sennheiser SmartControl Plus companion app for these cans is pretty good. It is a bit finicky when trying to work with the included BTD 700 dongle (need to connect to the phone's BT radio for the app to work, but need to also connect to and select the BTD 700 from list of output devices in order to actually get AptX Adaptive etc.). It also needs to be connected to the phone's BT radio when connected and playing via USB-C. With all that sorted out, functionality-wise, the app is great. UI is intuitive, it's smooth, and everything just works on my iPhone. I did try the app on my Android-based DAP (FiiO JM21) and I could not get it to work properly with it, so caveat emptor (I am able to add the cans to the app, but tapping on the cans in the app on Android didn't respond at all so I couldn't actually bring up the controls on my Android DAP).",

These I feel need no EQ at all for my tastes, and have probably my favorite stock tuning of any headphone I've owned.\n\nI love that there is no sub bass roll off. That combined with the relaxed treble make these sound fantastic. I listen to mostly Metal and they carry such a thick, powerful energy through the songs. \n\nI was listening to pull me under by Dream Theater last night and it was just...chefs kiss.\n\nI play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos/shows/movies with these and I would say they are damn near perfect for that as well in terms of tonality and comfort.\n\nOne thing I always hated about the sub $700 Hifimans was how they felt to hold and to wear. They felt cheap with the exception of maybe sundara. But these improve build and comfort in just about every way. They don't feel cheap or poorly built. Quite the opposite. The pads are surprisingly plush, the comfort strap is great, the clamp is perfect for my head, the mostly metal build feels high quality and sturdy.\n\nI don't even have any real complaints about the cable.

    "title": "WH950NB - The best $99 headphones",
    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Edifier or have any commercial interests in selling headphones. I just like music and love a good deal.\n\nThe Edifier WH950NB likely need no introduction; they launched for €150 in Europe two years ago, have been around €110 for a long time, and the white model has dipped to €71 for a week a few months ago. I bought them on launch, and waited for a long time to form my opinion.\n\nI commute a few hours with them daily, and charge them once a week. I'm coming from a Hifiman Deva Pro, Sennheiser HD58X, and HD560S. I cannot overstate it: these headphones are phenomenal. Not \"good enough for Bluetooth headphones\", no, I often use them as my preferred listening experience over the others.\n\nHere's the secret: you get a (somewhat restricted) parametric EQ in the Edifier app. However, I created a preset from data (and my ears) that sounds so, so much better than the default tuning (see attached image for graphs):\n\n39Hz -3dB 2.0 (Optional)\n\n3000Hz -8dB 2.0\n\n3300Hz 3dB 2.0\n\n9000Hz 3dB 0.5\n\nIf you use UAPP on Android you can do automatic sample rate switching so you bypass Android's resampler on LDAC, and with some extra parametric EQ bands in UAPP you can improve the sound signature slightly more (I can add my preset in a comment if anyone is interested).\n\nOther than sound signature, these do everything you'd expect from a modern pair of BT headphones. There's passive and active 3.5mm support, a massive two-week battery, multiple ANC modes, multi-point Bluetooth 5.3, 96/32 LDAC, safe volume limiter, low latency mode, theater surround sound mode, and most importantly, an amazing travel case with a bunch of accessoires included (airplane splitter, usb-c cable, 3.5mm L-shape cable, protection pad for the folded cup).\n\nGenuinely wondering how no one is talking about these. Some of my family members, friends and colleagues bought one on my recommendation and they all think it's an amazing product. I only hear about the €300+ products from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser etc.\n\nIs there anyone else that has these?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

    "selftext": "Today I received the brand-new FiiO K13 R2R DAC/AMP, which I picked up mainly out of curiosity to explore the sound signature of R2R technology. My current setup includes the Topping DX5 II, which absolutely shines with electronic genres (rave, techno, acid, house, IDM, EDM) you name it.. It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That’s exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I’ll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you’ve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

In some ways, they resemble the HE1000SE, though their soundstage feels much smaller compared to both the Sundara and the HEKSE.

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2flmc5e914yf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=70db2ea529ba5f5b1230ac28b4d91c7ec2cfedce\n\nSo, I want to talk about DACs. Personally, I’m not a believer in all that snake oil — people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don’t buy it. And honestly, I don’t think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I’ve always thought that if there’s any difference, it’s basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time — I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a “bigger soundstage,” I just assume it’s because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I’m open-minded — I’ll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that’s matched, everything else — bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging — sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I’m out. Either they’re trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don’t. In either case, their opinions don’t mean much to me anymore, because I can’t hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let’s talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn’t tell exactly what at first, but it didn’t feel like my imagination. After more testing — switching headphones, replaying the same tracks — I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head — especially those higher notes — in a way the K7 doesn’t. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that’s somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it’s like their voice locks into one spot — more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** — and I can’t believe I’m saying this — it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you — same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat’s not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer’s right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste — some benefit from that extra space, some don’t. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** — *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn’t huge, but it’s there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It’s actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it’s slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less “exciting.” The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah — I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It’s pricey, and there’s no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat’s my honest take.",

Feet are cheapish metal \"isolation\" spikes. Those were the nicest looking solution for getting the necessary ventilation clearance between the two amps.\n\nThe DX5 II is a really neat little box full of features and with all the power I need. Moved the previous Topping E50/L50 stack to my study. No need for any other DAC/amps until something breaks.\n\nThe Antares is for my Stax and the hopefully soon repaired Sennheiser HE-60. More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800. My impression is that it does something pleasing to the staging and shaves off most of the micro details, which can be relaxing depending on the mood and music. Despite recommendations it is  not good with the HD580 which, to me, already lacks resolution.

    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n→ Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n→ Punchy bass.  \n→ Delicious female vocals.  \n→ Soundstage above average.  \n→ No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n→ DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n→ If you are a purist, stay away.  \n→ Mids somewhat soft.  \n→ Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30€/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a “more and better.”\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:** present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:** this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:** here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:** somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:** maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:** with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:** substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:** too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:** I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:** at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:** placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:** keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:** could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:** testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko’s character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos’ voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:** testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once… I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:** dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:** not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:** paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:** I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it’s unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that “I’m going to make you have fun” vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/hzhh291a74yf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1330b369663156fd2593bc89c456bd2a8ca3e1fb\n\nHi everyone:\n\nI used both the QCC Pro and BTD700 dongles to test various codecs (aptX, aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC) and noticed some distortion in the high frequencies—especially with piano tracks. This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don’t have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn’t test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can’t go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle — I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would’ve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn’t have a mobile app, but there’s one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn’t update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they’re very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side — the QCC Pro’s mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro’s design but prefer the BTD700’s price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they’re an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey’re extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I’m very sensitive — even picky — about anything pressing on my head (I can’t stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw’s traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft — genuinely reminiscent of Hermès leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Hermès bags, you’ll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn’t mean they’re not good for solo performances — I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it’s more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced — I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water… and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

I got sick of the provided headset so I bought this set for work, being wireless, good battery life, good mic features (that noise fence tech is the real MVP). Usually I'll wear these over a set of flathead IEMs when I'm on the phone. These can do dual connection with BT and the usb dongle, just never really thought to use them for my phone. I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

    "selftext": "I already have the Sony WH-1000XM5, but I find it quite uncomfortable — I just can’t wear it for long sessions.\nSo I decided to look for a more comfortable pair and bought both the XM6 and the Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3 to test.\n\nBoth of them are way more comfortable than the XM5’s thin, stiff headband. However, after testing them for a while, I noticed a few issues:\n\t•\tThe XM5 actually sounds fuller and more bodied than the XM6. The XM6 feels smoother and less fatiguing during long listening sessions, but I also noticed a slight drop in bass impact compared to the XM5.\n\t•\tThe PX7 S3, on the other hand, is a completely different story. The sound quality is amazing — much richer, more powerful, and detailed than both the XM5 and XM6. It’s the kind of sound that makes you feel the music. But because of its strong low end and bright highs, it becomes tiring after a few songs.\n\nSo basically:\nThe XM6 is relaxing, but lacks emotion.\nThe PX7 S3 is exciting, but that excitement can be exhausting.\nAnd honestly, the ANC difference between the XM6 and PX7 S3 is on another level — the XM6's noise cancelling is just miles ahead.\nNow I'm stuck between comfort, emotion, and practicality.\n\nIf you were in my position - already owning the XM5\n— which one would you pick as your second pair?\nWould you go for the PX7 S3 for that immersive, emotional sound even if it's fatiguing over time, or would you choose the XM6 for its balance, better ANC, and overall smoother experience ?

    "selftext": "So I previously had upgraded from some generic brand headphones to the JBL Quantum One's. They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

But this is my office, and although I do have a nice stereo system here, headphones are sometimes more adequate. I've recently got a pair of Sennheiser HD600s, powered by a Fiio K11 R2R, and they work fine.\n\n  \nPerhaps my questions are more on the subject of headphones than of this one in particular, maybe. I use Sonus Faber Sonettos here, and I absolutely love them. The headphones just seem \"constrained\" maybe. I am not good at describing such things. But they seem to be lacking \"openness\" and some space. Don't know if it's the HD600s, the amp, or just the nature of headphones themselves, being placed in your head for example, I know their weight may be a factor, I don't know, just not feeling it.\n\n  \nHope any of you can relate and give me some advice, thank you all!",

The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn’t seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90°C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don’t cheap when clicked since there’s enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more “premium” (but that’s just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn’t have the chance to test the full 45  hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone’s bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren’t objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it’s pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven’t experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you’ll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you’re not getting Bose-like ANC you’re still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I’m on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn’t emphasize things too much making them almost “artificial” and I think it’s definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn’t low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you’re playing games and want a wireless set, I don’t think this is the right one, it’s just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don’t even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven’t encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let’s talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you’re going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review. \n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it’s there in the right quantity with average speed. It’s not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don’t hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn’t rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren’t fatiguing and they never become hot, and I’d say that they’re not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn’t fatiguing but there’s some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some “S” sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don’t really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn’t very spacious, but it’s okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I’d say but no true bad words to spend here either. \n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I’d say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I’d say it’s usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons: \n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of “inconsistent” sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they’re performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it’s the smarter choice between the two if you don’t wanna charge it as frequently as you’d do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that’s objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it’s a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not “bad” per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren’t big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it’s more of a “perceived” clarity” up top but it doesn’t really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I’d say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

    "selftext": "I've owned these headphones for about a month now, and I've used them every (sometimes every other) day, and while they aren't perfect, they are one thousand percent a worthwhile investment for those who seriously enjoy their music.\n\nI'll start by saying that I run these absolute units through a Schiit Lyr 3 with a SV 181 Art series vacuum tube. As far as I can tell, these sound spacious and full, with plenty of dynamic range. The bass is punchy and not muddled or softened at all, and the stereo experience is nothing short of exquisite. I've listened to everything from The Roots to George Michael, to Sade. I've used them for classical, jazz, rnb, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.\n\nTo start, where do these really have setbacks?\n\nFirstly, the weight of the headphones can get to you if you aren't as used to heavier headphones, but they haven't proven to be an issue for me. The build quality is great, the pads are soft, the headstrap distributes weight nicely. As a glasses-wearer I cannot properly review these because my current pair aren't adjusted well. As soon as I get my new pair I'll probably do an edited review because I know they'll feel better - I've test fit the headphones with other frames and they felt much better.\n\nSecond, the headstrap was stretched when I even received these headphones. I had to disassemble them and cut the headstrap down. Since then I've had a significantly better listening experience, especially when those sessions last hours.\n\nThose are really my only two major gripes with these headphones. Another small one might be the pads being pretty delicate, but my glasses frames also started to wear into them on one side...solely because they aren't adjusted well on the back of the ear. Not a major issue, but it causes discomfort so once again I will rewrite a review after I get a properly adjusted pair of frames soon.\n\nWhere are the places these headphones shine?\n\nDynamic range, as I previously mentioned, is very nice to my ears. There are plenty of moments where the music will build and seemingly envelop you in whatever you have playing. They give you this illusion of a full-body musical experience.\n\nImaging. Imaging, imaging, imaging! I can't say it enough. These are technically my second pair of audiophile headphones, and being able to really hear where each individual sound or instrument is in a mix is such a fun experience.\n\nSoundstage. I know not everybody is really the biggest fan of it, some people would rather have a more intimate experience with the music, however I've found to really enjoy the concert hall feeling I get when listening with these.\n\nOverall sound quality and clarity. These headphones just plain sound beautiful, with or without EQing them. \n\nIn conclusion: Although these have their imperfections, they are nothing short of an audiophile's wet dream, and are likely a great stopping point for many people in this hobby as well! I'm extremely happy owning them, and would really love to get some new pairs on my head to try in comparison. \n",

    "selftext": "***TL;DR:*** *Yes, they're that good. For me they hit all the sweet spots with ideal compromises for the price/package. The best ANC/Wireless/BT headphone I have heard. I think they deserve the hype in their neutral / out-of-the-box EQ. They cherry pick lots of great qualities and bundle them into a class defining package. I am happy they hit the price point they do. They feel made with love and care for anyone that loves high quality sound. They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good.

    "title": "HIFIMAN Ananda Nano vs Edition XS? Which is better? Why does the Nano bass sound a little overcooked on some tracks",
    "selftext": "I listened to both back-to-back, and both sounded amazing, but I definitely felt like the Ananda Nano was clearer and on every track, and you could definitely notice a difference. \n\nHowever, people kept saying the Edition XS bass is better than the Nano, but I felt the Nano's bass hit harder, and sometimes felt like it was overdone. \n\nFor example, I played Drakes “From Time”, and the bass sounded boomy, different to how my AirPods Pro 2, Edifier R2000DB and how the Edition XS presenter the bass - they all sounded correct. Nano’s bass sounded overdone Sort of similar to how the AirPods Pro 3 sounded, like it was too V-shaped. I prefer a neutral headphone with a slight V-emphasis. I don’t understand why the Nano would present the bass in this way given everyone has said it’s a neutral headphone. Can this bass be EQ’d?\n\nThe XS sounded perfect, but the Ananda Nano sounded a bit boomy. But on every other track, the bass sounded tight and great, and there was just more separation and overall clarity on the Ananda Nano. But people kept saying it's like an analytical, dry headphone. I'm open to EQing it, like I have an EQ software on my PC, but what would you recommend between the two of them?",

The measurements are basically on par with a simple pad swap onto the ADX3000. \n\nAnyway I am absolutely itching to buy new headphones, something fun, clear, open, with a nice treble pop to replace my Beyer DT1990's I've had since the release.  I was also one that got sucked into the HD800S hype - despite it being basically perfect i find them boring at times to where they sit in my drawer for over a year now without touching them.\n\n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hii hiii peeps, long story short of how I got into the hobby. It began with the Sennheiser momentum 4 headset. Loved how clear and Fun everything sounded to me and thus learned more about sound in general. Then I got some Kz iems, liked it and switch over to the Letshouer S12, but then my m4's broke. So i thought Fack it, let's go wired. Buying a Fosi Ds2 and the Celest T1 for convenience on the go.\n\nNext up I got a Philps X2hr, loved them even more, then bought some edifier r1700bt and was very happy. Next year I upgraded from my X2 to the Edition XS, and kept things simple. Of each medium I had one, I got a good iem, a good openback headphone and some fun speakers! My first endgame so to speak\n\nBut I thought, why not upgrade my iems? I use them the most so... I bought the Aful p7 and the snowsky retro nano as a new \"to go combo\". My edifier did stop working tho, so I bit the bullet and went all out with the Dali spektor 2. I pair them with a fosi V3 mini stereo amp and already had a fosi DS2 ! \n\nSo here I am, what a rabbit hole this is haha. But am almost certain that I won't go any deeper. It's been fun but i think am at the point where diminishing returns are good enough for me. So thanks to all of you for the advice and feel free to talk about the setup I got or give advice",

    "selftext": "Today I received the brand-new FiiO K13 R2R DAC/AMP, which I picked up mainly out of curiosity to explore the sound signature of R2R technology. My current setup includes the Topping DX5 II, which absolutely shines with electronic genres (rave, techno, acid, house, IDM, EDM) you name it.. It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That’s exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I’ll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you’ve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

In some ways, they resemble the HE1000SE, though their soundstage feels much smaller compared to both the Sundara and the HEKSE.

Personally, I’m not a believer in all that snake oil — people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don’t buy it. And honestly, I don’t think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I’ve always thought that if there’s any difference, it’s basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time — I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a “bigger soundstage,” I just assume it’s because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I’m open-minded — I’ll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that’s matched, everything else — bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging — sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I’m out. Either they’re trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don’t. In either case, their opinions don’t mean much to me anymore, because I can’t hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let’s talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn’t tell exactly what at first, but it didn’t feel like my imagination. After more testing — switching headphones, replaying the same tracks — I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head — especially those higher notes — in a way the K7 doesn’t. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that’s somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it’s like their voice locks into one spot — more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** — and I can’t believe I’m saying this — it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you — same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat’s not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer’s right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste — some benefit from that extra space, some don’t. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** — *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn’t huge, but it’s there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It’s actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it’s slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less “exciting.” The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah — I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It’s pricey, and there’s no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat’s my honest take.",

Feet are cheapish metal \"isolation\" spikes. Those were the nicest looking solution for getting the necessary ventilation clearance between the two amps.\n\nThe DX5 II is a really neat little box full of features and with all the power I need. Moved the previous Topping E50/L50 stack to my study. No need for any other DAC/amps until something breaks.\n\nThe Antares is for my Stax and the hopefully soon repaired Sennheiser HE-60. More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800. My impression is that it does something pleasing to the staging and shaves off most of the micro details, which can be relaxing depending on the mood and music. Despite recommendations it is  not good with the HD580 which, to me, already lacks resolution. Need to set up an A/B comparison one of these days to see if I am just imagining things. \n\nHeadphones are Stax Lambda Nova Basic, which I got for cheap with one of the utter crap Stay entry level amps.",

    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n→ Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n→ Punchy bass.  \n→ Delicious female vocals.  \n→ Soundstage above average.  \n→ No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n→ DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n→ If you are a purist, stay away.  \n→ Mids somewhat soft.  \n→ Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30€/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a “more and better.”\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:** present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:** this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:** here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:** somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:** maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:** with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:** substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:** too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:** I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:** at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:** placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:** keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:** could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:** testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko’s character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos’ voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:** testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once… I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:** dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:** not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:** paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:** I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it’s unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that “I’m going to make you have fun” vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/hzhh291a74yf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1330b369663156fd2593bc89c456bd2a8ca3e1fb\n\nHi everyone:\n\nI used both the QCC Pro and BTD700 dongles to test various codecs (aptX, aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC) and noticed some distortion in the high frequencies—especially with piano tracks. This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don’t have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn’t test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can’t go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle — I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would’ve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn’t have a mobile app, but there’s one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn’t update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they’re very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side — the QCC Pro’s mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro’s design but prefer the BTD700’s price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they’re an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey’re extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I’m very sensitive — even picky — about anything pressing on my head (I can’t stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw’s traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft — genuinely reminiscent of Hermès leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Hermès bags, you’ll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn’t mean they’re not good for solo performances — I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it’s more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced — I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water… and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

I got sick of the provided headset so I bought this set for work, being wireless, good battery life, good mic features (that noise fence tech is the real MVP). Usually I'll wear these over a set of flathead IEMs when I'm on the phone. These can do dual connection with BT and the usb dongle, just never really thought to use them for my phone. I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

    "selftext": "Hello, I’ve been trying to use Moonlight for hours to get clean image quality with no latency, but I’ve noticed that streaming with the MoonDeck plugin makes the stream really choppy for some reason. It just doesn’t feel smooth at all, the smoothness seems completely random depending on where I’m looking in the game. Sometimes it feels like I’m playing at 90 FPS, and other times it drops to around 30.\n\nWhen I stream using the desktop app, everything works perfectly, not a single lag, super smooth gameplay, streaming at 1440p 90 Hz.\n\nMy PC is powerful (7800X3D, 9070XT), and my internet connection (I’m not playing locally) is 1 Gbps on both sides. On my Steam Deck OLED the Wi-Fi speed is around 600 Mbps. So yeah, I’m pretty sure the issue comes from the MoonDeck plugin for some reason.\n\nI’ve tested a ton of resolutions (Deck native, 1080p, 1440p, 4K) and different bandwidth settings, but the results are totally inconsistent.\n\nIs anyone else having the exact same issue?\nAgain, the desktop app is super smooth and the image quality is amazing.\n\nI really like the MoonDeck plugin, playing through the desktop app is annoying since I have to switch controller configurations every time.",

And a lot of care went into making it work on Steam Deck's Desktop Mode without disabling the read-only file system. The setup process takes less than 5 minutes and Breezy Desktop works really well with multiple virtual displays on Steam Deck's hardware.\n\n# Roadmap\n\nHere's what's still in the works.\n\n**6DoF features**\n\n6DoF allows you to \"lean in\" to see the screen more clearly or move about it. Some glasses have built-in cameras that make 6DoF possible. We can also use a webcam to offer these features (see the next section for how this can be done with OpenTrack). XR Gaming and Breezy's anchoring effects need to be updated to support this, and then the GUI/configuration options (e.g. screen distance and size) need to be made more clear within that context.\n\n**My driver already supports receiving OpenTrack UDP data as an alternative input source, which opens the door for things like:**\n\n* Using Breezy Desktop features on a remote machine\n* 6DoF features -- a low-res webcam works really well with OpenTrack's NeuralNet module.\n* Drift correction using a complimentary 3DoF source.\n* Providing 3DoF and 6DoF support for *any* glasses (not just the currently supported brands and models) with a webcam and OpenTrack's NeuralNet module\n\n# Wrapping up\n\n**Note**: Breezy Desktop is fully open source, but does [switch to a paid model](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#breezy-desktop-pricing-productivity-tier) after 2 trial months have ended, with free options available. Just a heads up so that doesn't catch anyone off guard.\n\n**Want to stay updated?** I post more regularly [on my Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/watercanhydrate), [Discord](https://discord.gg/aJT72wKpXn), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/wheaney), less frequently on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WayneHeaney), or you can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wheaney).\n\n**Ready to try it?** Get started with [Breezy KDE](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#kde-plasma-setup-beta), [XR Gaming](https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming#installation), or [Breezy GNOME setup](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#gnome-setup) and let me know what you think!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI'm a solo dev working on [Arcadium - Space Odyssey](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352670/Arcadium__Space_Odyssey/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=steamdeck&utm_campaign=releasedate), a fast paced roguelite where you drain planets to survive.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, I asked for help testing the game on the Steam Deck, as I can't afford one at the moment. The response was incredible, and thanks to all your feedback, the game now runs even smoother and feels much better to play.\n\nI’ve improved joystick sensitivity, added clearer animated highlights for selections, fixed navigation issues, and polished several UI details.  \nFor the full changelog: [Changelog](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2352670/view/594038293962686548)  \nSteam Page: [Arcadium - Space Odyssey](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352670/Arcadium__Space_Odyssey/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=steamdeck&utm_campaign=releasedate)\n\nAlso, Arcadium – Space Odyssey officially releases January 2026, and you can try out the demo right now!  \nThanks again to everyone who tested and shared feedback; you genuinely helped make the game better.",

Ergonomics are fine? Feels like cheap plastic, which is fine given that’s what’s light and durable. But why everyone says this feels like a Mercedes? I found switch lite more comfortable.\n\n2. Software is fine? Why did it come with 100+ pieces of bloat despite reviewers saying no bloat? \n\n3. Only 7 of my ~30 steam games are verified.. I guess that was a little disappointing. Not super worried here as I’m sure most will play fine. But sort of a weird UX to see a folder saying only 7 of your games are good to go.\n\n4. It’s been a little rough adjusting to this format.

I’ve tried selecting both the current and previous versions, but no matter what I choose, when it finally loads into SteamOS, the left joystick doesn’t work properly, it only seems to adjust the brightness instead of moving between games. \n\nI’ve tried switching to Desktop Mode and then back to Game Mode, but that didn’t fix it either.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this or know what could be causing it? I’m hoping it’s something software-related and not a hardware failure.\n\nAny help would be super appreciated!\n",

I did some research and found out that people were having it repaired under warranty, I bought my Steamdeck several years ago and wasn't sure that I even had a warranty left. I decided that I would repair it myself since it might be faster than trying to send it back to Valve. I bought a replacement battery and spent some stressful minutes trying to remove the dead battery. After removing it I gently installed my new battery and brought my deck to the charger and was relived to see %1 battery life. I am not used to repairing expensive electronics myself and am so happy that I am holding a charge again. The picture below is the kit that I used for anyone needing to do this repair in the future.

    "selftext": "**TL;DR - XREAL, VITURE, RayNeo, and Rokid users: Breezy Desktop now works with Steam Deck's desktop mode or any KDE Plasma system.** [**Setup takes only a few minutes**](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#kde-plasma-setup-beta)\n\nHey Deck-heads!\n\nI'm back to announce that Breezy Desktop -- an XR workspace app for XREAL, VITURE, RayNeo, and Rokid users -- now runs natively on SteamOS with the addition of KDE Plasma support. And a lot of care went into making it work on Steam Deck's Desktop Mode without disabling the read-only file system. The setup process takes less than 5 minutes and Breezy Desktop works really well with multiple virtual displays on Steam Deck's hardware.\n\n# Roadmap\n\nHere's what's still in the works.\n\n**6DoF features**\n\n6DoF allows you to \"lean in\" to see the screen more clearly or move about it. Some glasses have built-in cameras that make 6DoF possible. We can also use a webcam to offer these features (see the next section for how this can be done with OpenTrack). XR Gaming and Breezy's anchoring effects need to be updated to support this, and then the GUI/configuration options (e.g. screen distance and size) need to be made more clear within that context.\n\n**My driver already supports receiving OpenTrack UDP data as an alternative input source, which opens the door for things like:**\n\n* Using Breezy Desktop features on a remote machine\n* 6DoF features -- a low-res webcam works really well with OpenTrack's NeuralNet module.\n* Drift correction using a complimentary 3DoF source.\n* Providing 3DoF and 6DoF support for *any* glasses (not just the currently supported brands and models) with a webcam and OpenTrack's NeuralNet module\n\n# Wrapping up\n\n**Note**: Breezy Desktop is fully open source, but does [switch to a paid model](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#breezy-desktop-pricing-productivity-tier) after 2 trial months have ended, with free options available. Just a heads up so that doesn't catch anyone off guard.\n\n**Want to stay updated?** I post more regularly [on my Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/watercanhydrate), [Discord](https://discord.gg/aJT72wKpXn), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/wheaney), less frequently on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WayneHeaney), or you can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wheaney).\n\n**Ready to try it?** Get started with [Breezy KDE](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#kde-plasma-setup-beta), [XR Gaming](https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming#installation), or [Breezy GNOME setup](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#gnome-setup) and let me know what you think!",

It just doesn’t feel smooth at all, the smoothness seems completely random depending on where I’m looking in the game. Sometimes it feels like I’m playing at 90 FPS, and other times it drops to around 30.\n\nWhen I stream using the desktop app, everything works perfectly, not a single lag, super smooth gameplay, streaming at 1440p 90 Hz.\n\nMy PC is powerful (7800X3D, 9070XT), and my internet connection (I’m not playing locally) is 1 Gbps on both sides. On my Steam Deck OLED the Wi-Fi speed is around 600 Mbps. So yeah, I’m pretty sure the issue comes from the MoonDeck plugin for some reason.\n\nI’ve tested a ton of resolutions (Deck native, 1080p, 1440p, 4K) and different bandwidth settings, but the results are totally inconsistent.\n\nIs anyone else having the exact same issue?\nAgain, the desktop app is super smooth and the image quality is amazing.\n\nI really like the MoonDeck plugin, playing through the desktop app is annoying since I have to switch controller configurations every time.",

    "selftext": "**TL;DR - XREAL, VITURE, RayNeo, and Rokid users: Breezy Desktop now works with Steam Deck's desktop mode or any KDE Plasma system.** [**Setup takes only a few minutes**](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#kde-plasma-setup-beta)\n\nHey Deck-heads!\n\nI'm back to announce that Breezy Desktop -- an XR workspace app for XREAL, VITURE, RayNeo, and Rokid users -- now runs natively on SteamOS with the addition of KDE Plasma support. And a lot of care went into making it work on Steam Deck's Desktop Mode without disabling the read-only file system. The setup process takes less than 5 minutes and Breezy Desktop works really well with multiple virtual displays on Steam Deck's hardware.\n\n# Roadmap\n\nHere's what's still in the works.\n\n**6DoF features**\n\n6DoF allows you to \"lean in\" to see the screen more clearly or move about it. Some glasses have built-in cameras that make 6DoF possible. We can also use a webcam to offer these features (see the next section for how this can be done with OpenTrack). XR Gaming and Breezy's anchoring effects need to be updated to support this, and then the GUI/configuration options (e.g. screen distance and size) need to be made more clear within that context.\n\n**My driver already supports receiving OpenTrack UDP data as an alternative input source, which opens the door for things like:**\n\n* Using Breezy Desktop features on a remote machine\n* 6DoF features -- a low-res webcam works really well with OpenTrack's NeuralNet module.\n* Drift correction using a complimentary 3DoF source.\n* Providing 3DoF and 6DoF support for *any* glasses (not just the currently supported brands and models) with a webcam and OpenTrack's NeuralNet module\n\n# Wrapping up\n\n**Note**: Breezy Desktop is fully open source, but does [switch to a paid model](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#breezy-desktop-pricing-productivity-tier) after 2 trial months have ended, with free options available. Just a heads up so that doesn't catch anyone off guard.\n\n**Want to stay updated?** I post more regularly [on my Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/watercanhydrate), [Discord](https://discord.gg/aJT72wKpXn), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/wheaney), less frequently on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WayneHeaney), or you can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wheaney).\n\n**Ready to try it?** Get started with [Breezy KDE](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#kde-plasma-setup-beta), [XR Gaming](https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming#installation), or [Breezy GNOME setup](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop#gnome-setup) and let me know what you think!",

It just doesn’t feel smooth at all, the smoothness seems completely random depending on where I’m looking in the game. Sometimes it feels like I’m playing at 90 FPS, and other times it drops to around 30.\n\nWhen I stream using the desktop app, everything works perfectly, not a single lag, super smooth gameplay, streaming at 1440p 90 Hz.\n\nMy PC is powerful (7800X3D, 9070XT), and my internet connection (I’m not playing locally) is 1 Gbps on both sides. On my Steam Deck OLED the Wi-Fi speed is around 600 Mbps. So yeah, I’m pretty sure the issue comes from the MoonDeck plugin for some reason.\n\nI’ve tested a ton of resolutions (Deck native, 1080p, 1440p, 4K) and different bandwidth settings, but the results are totally inconsistent.\n\nIs anyone else having the exact same issue?\nAgain, the desktop app is super smooth and the image quality is amazing.\n\nI really like the MoonDeck plugin, playing through the desktop app is annoying since I have to switch controller configurations every time.",

The goal is this:\n\nMy boss wants to have an intercom that can connect to three different offices within the same building (~40-50 ft in distance from eachother). We purchased a wuloo intercom but he does not like having to remember the channels for each office. Ideally, this intercom system will have just a single button where he can press and instantly connect to any of the offices individually. It needs to be wireless and battery operated. TIA!",

    "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nWinter is coming and mornings are getting darker every day and they will be in my neck of woods for the next 4-monhts. I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess. \n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!",

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home.

The issue I am seeing with this is that the this will only work as long as my phone is within range of the lighbulbs. I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue. Had my phone on airplane mode during when the lights were supposed to turn on and they did. ",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

    "selftext": "I have a stairwell that has three entry points in which I have installed occupancy sensors at each entry point in parallel. Thus, any occupancy sensor can turn on the stairwell lights and when all sensors have turned off the lights for the stairwell turn off. However, I'd like this to be on a scheduled routine whereby at night time the lights either come on or preferably come on very dimly. Would anyone have any suggestions on products that might achieve this? If need be I would certainly set up a Home Assistant server to accommodate this project. I set up a home assistant server a few years ago but couldn't quite justify keeping it in place as I didn't have the need at the time. But this would push me over this threshold should it be necessary. Thanks for your guidance!\n\nPs this would also work great in a residential bathroom: occupancy sensors and bathrooms are great except when it's the middle of the night!",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea.

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m setting up automation in my new apartment (about 65 sqm) and would love some advice on where to start.\n\nMy plan is quite simple — I’d like to have:\n- A couple of smart socket relays\n- A few motion/presence sensors\n- Automated curtains (I’ll use Somfy for that)\n\nI don’t want anything too complex like Home Assistant, since I won’t have too many scenes or devices. Ideally, I’d like to avoid having several different hubs.\n\nI noticed that the new Echo Dot Max has a built-in smart hub supporting Zigbee, Matter, and Thread Border Router.\nIf I understand correctly, does this mean I wouldn’t need any additional hubs, and I could connect different Zigbee or Matter devices directly to Alexa?\n\nIs the Echo Dot Max good choice as smart home hub? Is Alexa a good choice for simple automation setups?\n\nWhich protocol would you recommend — Matter, Zigbee?\n\nAny recommendations for socket relays and motion/presence sensors that work well with Alexa?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips or personal experiences!",

And I do still want to be safety minded for any risks there might be for things like that. But I'm also going through a lot of big life changes right now that having a little help from an at home assistant type device would be super helpful where I can just tell it a thing and it will remind me or add it to other devices and stuff like that. I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup?

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

I checked and the Vaillant is 2 wired.\n\nI guess i need to replace both of them with smart thermostat but in other rooms i have radiators where I want to add smart valves.\n\nCan I turn my radiators on and off seperately if the smart thermostat upstairs is for example on 20°c and i want another room 25°c?\n\nCan i just replace the Vaillant downstairs? Remove the one upstairs and just use the smart valves on the radiators, or do i need to replace the one upstairs also?\n\nAny recommendations what and how to do? Any recommendations on products to use?\n\nSorry for the newb questions.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home. Rpi cannot be hidden well due to fairly weak wifi reception\n\nThanks guys! ",

I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated.

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "title": "Any way to automatically generate an on/off signal without touching wall-switch?",
    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4).

NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

I am trying to figure out a way to use the smart devices as much as possible without making them exposed to or used by renters/PM folks etc.  My inventory so far is \n\n* a dozen wifi smart switches (but not all of the house) that seem Tuya\n* 4 ring cameras, \n* a smart TV (LG ThinQ), \n* a tuya smart lock\n* An Arris Cable Modem\n* A bunch of older 5G networking gear \n* a few oddballs like a water level monitor for a cistern.  \n\nNone of it seems to be connected (although I suspect the PM firm can access the Ring cameras).\n\nI'm looking for some thoughts on a low impact, high reliability solution to leverage as much as I can.  At the moment, I am planning to tie all the switches and ring cameras into Smart Life and Ring which will add them to my Alexa account.  It seems like I am missing some opportunity to use the TV as a hub for al this.  (No interest in a Home Assistant solution).\n\n  \nThoughts?",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

I see so many out there. \n\nAlso I have a Nest Gen 3 thermostat, it seems like I can't directly integrate it, is it worth getting and API to do that or better to buy a different one, and any recommendations?  \n\nI currently have Eufy cameras, first alert smoke alarms, Govee lights, and switch bot vacuum and curtain openers. \n\nSorry for the long post, thanks in advance.

The issue I am seeing with this is that the this will only work as long as my phone is within range of the lighbulbs. I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue. Had my phone on airplane mode during when the lights were supposed to turn on and they did. ",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

What I am not really clear on is if the hub is all I require to be able to control these blinds and communicate with an app or will I also need to get a whole house hub??\n\nI just built my house so I have added a bunch of different smart tech - locks, heating system, garage doors are Wi-Fi, now blinds and I’ve got some Eufy cameras to install. It’s starting to be a lot of different apps so it might be worth it to get something to tie it all together. If that’s even possible- I’m not sure but I’m willing to bet that someone on here will know!!\n\nTIA!",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

I’ve got the basics covered so far: a dishwasher, robot vacuum for cleaning, AC and central ventilation, a smart lock and cameras for security, plus whole-house lighting control and electric curtains.\n\nNow I’m thinking of adding something a bit different next, maybe for the shower room or the room that opens onto the balcony. I’ve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it’s on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI’m also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I’m leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven’t found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you’ve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I’d love to hear what worked for you.

I’m not a complete noob as I’m pretty tech savvy, but here, I’m really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I’m not here and I didn’t plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it’s only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can’t connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I’ve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn’t change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically… but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn’t detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I’m missing ? A secret step ?",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - seeking wired zwave, zigbee or WiFi motion and/or presence sensors. The next requirement is that they have programmable sensitivity and trigger time. \n\nThanks!\n\n————-\n\n\nI’m tired of batteries. I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I’m ready to just go wired where I can. It’s inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it’s hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is … no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

    "title": "Smart home Setup - internet issues",
    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "title": "Dark Apartment - need ideas / solutions",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

So I thought I'd ask here and maybe one of you know and has some insight?!\n\nI'm looking for a doorbell that is connected to an electrical outlet/electricity and that also has battery as a backup in case there is a power outage.\n\nThis doorbell should be connected to wifi and should also have 4g/5g as a backup in case the wifi stops working due to, for example, a power outage.\n\nThis doorbell should have a high-quality camera and there should be an app for this doorbell.\n\n(Extra question is, this doorbell, can the person knocking/ringing see if the doorbell camera is being used? For example, a courier/carrier rings on my doorbell. I open the app to see who is ringing. Can the courier/carrier see that I am using the camera on my doorbell to see who is ringing or not?)\n\nDoes anyone here know which company or brand offers and sells this type of doorbell that I am looking for?\n\nAs I said, I have looked around and it is complicated, so I really appreciate any help I can get!",

The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

Thank you all so much, I really appreciate this community so much. \n\n\n\nHi all, thank you in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\n**Prior to our issues:** we have a Google Home and multiple brands/types of smart devices. All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

    "selftext": "Two days ago, bought and installed an Ecobee premium to replace my wifi Honeywell T6. Way back in the day I had a 2nd gen Nest but have been living in places with split or no ACs.\n\nDay one, I came home from work much earlier than I normally do, walked past the Ecobee and verified it detected \"occupied\" in HASS. The thermostat just stayed in away mode without adjusting for my normal home temperature.\n\nDay two, I set up me and my wife's phones to geofence to help the Ecobee know when we were home/away. She ran out to do some errands while I was home and the thermostat switched over into \"away\" mode even though I was standing in front of it.\n\nIt's been years, but I seem to remember my 2nd gen Nest being much better at recognizing home/away (without geofencing) and has me thinking of swapping the Ecobee out.\n\nI'm pretty knew to home assistant but I feel like I could set up automations that would do a better job of recognizing home/away status with the T6 than how the Ecobee has performed so far. Am I missing something or not having a setting turned on/off?",

I’ve got the basics covered so far: a dishwasher, robot vacuum for cleaning, AC and central ventilation, a smart lock and cameras for security, plus whole-house lighting control and electric curtains.\n\nNow I’m thinking of adding something a bit different next, maybe for the shower room or the room that opens onto the balcony. I’ve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it’s on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI’m also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I’m leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven’t found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you’ve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I’d love to hear what worked for you.

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

I’m not a complete noob as I’m pretty tech savvy, but here, I’m really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I’m not here and I didn’t plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it’s only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can’t connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I’ve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn’t change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically… but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn’t detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I’m missing ? A secret step ?",

    "selftext": "We have an mudroom + hallway that form an L shape. There were originally a 3-way switches for the lighting in this space, one at each end of the L. I since installed a Lutron Maestro motion sensing switch one end, since the product said your cannot have two in a 3 way circuit. The problem is that of course, the sensor doesn't pick up the motion until you turn the corner.\n\nI'm looking for a solution that:\n\n1) detects motion from either end\n2) allows for manual operation\n3) is smart enough that if I turn off the light, the motion sensor doesn't immediately turn it back on. The single Maestro switch has that feature. \n\nI have Lutron Caseta switches + hub elsewhere in the house, so bonus if it all works together. OTOH, I don't think I need to control these lights from an app. \n\nI saw there is a Lutron motion sensor (PD-OSENS-WH) that pairs with a Caseta kind of like a Pico remote. I was thinking of mounting that in the corner of the L, but I think that violates #3 since it has no knowledge of the light was manually operated from the Caseta.\n\nCan someone suggest some options?

The next requirement is that they have programmable sensitivity and trigger time. \n\nThanks!\n\n————-\n\n\nI’m tired of batteries. I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I’m ready to just go wired where I can. It’s inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it’s hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is … no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

    "selftext": "3200sqft home, 2 story and single zone. Bedroom is on upper floor, living area is downstairs. Thermostat is on the bottom floor. No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

Can anyone suggest a solution? I reached out to the manufacturer and they are shipping a replacement circuit board. Hopefully that fixes it, but could there be a problem with the circuit?

How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

What I am not really clear on is if the hub is all I require to be able to control these blinds and communicate with an app or will I also need to get a whole house hub??\n\nI just built my house so I have added a bunch of different smart tech - locks, heating system, garage doors are Wi-Fi, now blinds and I’ve got some Eufy cameras to install. It’s starting to be a lot of different apps so it might be worth it to get something to tie it all together. If that’s even possible- I’m not sure but I’m willing to bet that someone on here will know!!\n\nTIA!",

(Preferably I can get them on amazon de)\n\nBasically, I want a simple, renter-friendly setup that lets me control and customize lighting around the apartment without touching any wiring, that I can latter move them to other place and that they are scalable and what I mean by that is that I can latter expand my smarthome and connect other stuff to it\n\nAny advice or personal experience would be super helpful!\n\nThanks in advance ",

I’m not a complete noob as I’m pretty tech savvy, but here, I’m really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I’m not here and I didn’t plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it’s only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can’t connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I’ve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn’t change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically… but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn’t detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I’m missing ? A secret step ?",

    "selftext": "So, this question is referred especially to streaming services or videos in general seen on some kind of mobile browser. (So apps, such as YouTube are an \"exception\")\n\nI usually consume video media on different sites on the web from my phone (samsung galaxy s24 plus) but noticed this issue where almost all videos after some minutes (the range is from 2 to 5 minutes) the video just blocks acting like the connection ended and couldn't be restored so I'm forced to refresh the page all the time and try to get the video to the same moment, just for the issue to be repeted not long after. At first I thought the issue was of the streaming services, the sites or my mobile internet provider, but after I tried consuming those same medias on my tablet (Samsung galaxy tab s8+) the issue wouldn't be present. Same result if I tried to connect the tablet to my phone's mobile data, just to prove that the issue wasn't the internet provider itself but something related to the phone(the same browser apps where used to go into these sites btw).\n\nSorry for the bad English I'm not a native speaker, if something's not clear tell me and I'll try to explain myself better",

    "selftext": "Firstly, I'll let you know about me, I have been in IT for 30 years, and work as a PC builder and tester for some of that time.\n\nI pride myself on having a 100% stable PC, I know that there are people for whom an occasional crash is \"Oh, that's just Windows\"\n\nMy PC is a mini-ITX build, Nvidia GPU, Intel 14600KF, 32GB DDR 4 G-Skill RAM, on a B660, then B760 motherboard (keep reading)\n\nSo recently, as in the last few months, my PC would occasionally crash, maybe a blue screen, maybe a complete freeze, forcing a hard reset, and sometimes the system would spontaneously restart.\n\nI reviewed event logs and mini-dumps and was pointed towards a memory issue.\n\nI reset BIOS, disabled XMP, and ran Memtest from an external boot USB drive.\n\nI immediately started getting errors, and I mean thousands!\n\nI stopped, shut down the system, removed one stick and ran Memtest\n\nExactly the same result, hundreds and hundreds of errors\n\nI stopped again, shut down the system, removed that one stick and replaced the other one in a different slot, and ran memtest\n\nExactly the same result, hundreds and hundreds of errors\n\nNow, when I say my system occasionally crashed, I mean maybe once a week, to see this many errors I would doubt the PC could run and do any tasks! For example, Prime 95 RAM stress test did not return errors.\n\nSo, I assumed that this must be a memory controller error, the chances of BOTH sticks or RAM being faulty at the same time, is highly unlikely.\n\nAnd so, I replaced the mother board.\n\nUnfortunately, the intermittent errors remain, but sadly I no longer get bluescreens, and the event log simply records that the system recovered from an unexpected restart, with no capture of the causing event.\n\nI no longer have access to the sorts of testing gear and hardware swaps that I used to, so any test would require buying components, testing, and returning if not successful.\n\nBefore I embark on that exercise, I thought I'd open up for advice on what to do?\n\nShould I buy two new stuck of RAM\n\nReplace the processor\n\nGo all out and get a new motherboard and swap to AMD?\n\nJust accept the occasional error and save the effort and cost!\n\nThanks! I appreciate you reading all of this!",

I had the PSU out separately and only connected the 24 pin, cpu, and PCIE for the GPU.\n\nIt did not work again, and then I tried taking parts out one by one.

    "selftext": "So imagine this, one day I'm using my Xbox one controller, playing BeamNG on my pc (Windows 11). Out of nowhere, the controller disconnects, I try to reconnect it, but it says \"driver error\". So I look up how to update the driver, and use the \"Xbox accessories\" app to do it (BTW why do you have to sign in to a microsoft account to UPDATE A DRIVER???)\n\nAfter updating the driver, whatever I do, the controller either a) refuses to connect altogether (I have to spam the connect button for there to even be a chance) or b) it connects, and immediately disconnects.\n\nThe peculiar thing is, If I hold the controller 1cm from the Bluetooth/Wi-Fi antennas, the controller works perfectly. If I so much as move an INCH, the controller disconnects. So it seems like the problem is the signal strength, EVEN THOUGH IT WORKED PERFECTLY BEFORE.\n\nAfter battling with the first controller for a while, I get my old Xbox one controller from like 2016, and try to connect it to my PC. It works perfectly. I continue playing BeamNG, a happy man.\n\nBut then, after a few weeks, IT HAPPENS AGAIN. Same shit. Driver error. I update the driver. Can't connect anymore. And yes I tested it with another PC, the controllers still don't work.\n\nSo it seems I have been left with two paperweights, shaped like controllers. Thanks a lot Microsoft.\n\nBut seriously, is there anything I can do? Is there a way to downgrade drivers? Because obviously something shitty went on there.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo turns out you can revert firmware on the OLD controller using the this link pasted into the run dialog (found it on GitHub):\n\nxboxaccessories://firmwareupdate?legacyDowngrade=true\n\nWhich is crazy. You can't do it on the new controller since the firmware you would be reverting to is too old, and on top of everything, you can't even do it on the Xbox version of Xbox accessories anymore. You used to, but it was taken out... I see threads from FIVE YEARS AGO describing the same exact problem I am having now, and it still hasn't been fixed.\n\nSo now I have just ONE useless paperweight. Thanks again Microsoft.",

    "selftext": "I have a Logitech G233 headset. I'm tired of using over-ear headphones, so I want to use silicone in-ear earbuds similar to phone earbuds. The problem I'm having is that if I plug my Logitech headset into my desktop computer, regardless of whether it's the front or rear panel, the sound is great. However, if I use the splitter on my Logitech headset to plug in a phone headset (I've tried several different brands), the sound has an echo. I notice this echo especially when playing games and listening to music. The game I play the most is CS2, and it's impossible to play. Whenever I hear a gunshot, it feels like my head is going to explode. I just can't seem to find a solution. My Logitech speakers have great sound, and the headset is great too, but whenever I plug in any in-ear headphones, the sound immediately becomes echoey. I am using my g233 splitter but I bought a new splitter to try, but I don't think it will solve the problem. My motherboard is an MSI B550 Pro, and my sound card driver is up to date Realtek 6.0.9865.1 . What do you think is causing the problem? Should I get special in-ear headphones for desktop computers? After all, I need an aux splitter to use them. Does anyone else have any ideas?\n\n",

It was showing error code: 0xc0000098 file: winload.efi.\n\nBased on the errors I saw on the minidumps (I don't understand them properly, tried using the BSOD guide from here), I tried a few things:\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n* Updated bios\n* Tried powering on both with xmp enabled/disabled.\n* Uninstalled vanguard with revo uninstaller (did this because I got two bsod specifying vgk.sys).\n* Reseated and checked my ram with memtest86. Zero errors on 4 passes\n* Tried stress testing cpu and gpu with furmark2\n* Tried two different psus\n* Tried sfc /scannow and chkdsk\n* Set everything to default bios settings, did not try over/underclocking or undervolting anything.\n\nFor every change I make I wait some time to see if I'll stop having the crashes, but I got crashes after all of them. No error or weird behaviors during any of the testings... The computer seems to be working normally except for these crashes.\n\nI'm a bit out of ideas on what else I can try... I lost the first minidumps after the first windows reinstall. I kinda had to because of the recent windows update issue with keyboard/mouse not working on recovery mode.\n\nHere is a link I got from specify with my minidumps: [https://spec-ify.com/profile/56eadeb1](https://spec-ify.com/profile/56eadeb1)\n\nMediafire link: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/4jahflecunybyyu/Minidump.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4jahflecunybyyu/Minidump.rar/file)\n\nI pasted the minidumps from the previous windows installation on the minidumps folder so they would be included (I just did the last one)\n\nMy specs: Windows 11 Pro Motherboard: Gigabyte B650M D3HP  \nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D  \nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070  \nRAM: Kingston KF556C16BB/16 5600MHz 16384MB  \nSSD: KINGSTON SNV3S1000G",

I have recently bought a new Redmi 14C phone, MIUI HyperOS 1.0.7.0, and I have the following issue:\n\nI genuinely cannot talk to anyone on speaker because the calls are *stuck at maximum volume.* When I try to press the volume-down button, a slider shows up, it has a speaker icon, but it is at the lowest value, and sliding it up (or pressing the volume-up button) or back down does absolutely nothing, my phone still blasts my ear with the voice of the other person on the line.\n\nRegular phone calls, meaning with the speaker turned off, work perfectly fine and I can adjust the volume. Not an accessibility setting, I have tried everything and messed around way too much in the settings app, the only solution so far was to simply use headphones when calling someone.\n\nAnother thing I have noticed is: 1) This is not only on the phone app but also on WhatsApp and Meet, so basically all calling apps with the speaker feature, 2) On whatsapp, the call sounds (you know those little sounds when you start a call or end a call) are also at maximum volume, so loud that you can hear white noise while they play.\n\nHelp??",

Since last Tuesday, 10/21, my PC has been randomly closing apps, shutting down completely (BSOD)w, etc. I took it to a local shop and have the guy look at it, but he was not able to figure anything out other than my CPU was running at meltdown level temperatures. New fans were installed and motherboard, CPU, GPU, and Windows updates/drivers were installed. Got the PC back and I am still having those same issues. Valorant crashes with faulty/corrupt files, Battlefield 6 does not even let me download the update because of corrupt files.\n\nFrom what I have read, this looks to be related to a faulty PSU?

For few minutes it works normally then left and right button (also side buttons) are switched. Cursor works normally. In game settings are as they should be (Eg. Fire is left button assigned in settings but physically I have to press right button). It's seemingly random. Sometimes I boot up the game and it works fine. Sometimes no. Restarting the game and PC doesn't do nothing it's literally random. It's even interesting because sometimes in game menus work with normal right and left click. But gameplay is inverted. Once in Ready Or not I booted up the game played for few minutes normally then mouse inverted again. Few minutes and it went back to normal for a while then it inverted again. Sometimes it goes for few days. \n\nWhat is funny is Windows works normally on pulpit. Windows mouse properties are fine. Everything seems normal but it's not.\n\nWindows 11 btw with AMD card and procesor (not sure about exact specs so I don't want give bad info, I will update in free moment)\n\nHaven't found anyone on Reddit or other forums with this problem. Even ChatGPT is clueless.\n\nPlease help guys.",

I used GPT to summarize everything I explained before so it’s easier to understand the full situation.\n\nI’m losing my mind over this RX 580 2048SP issue and I really need some experienced eyes on it.\nHere’s everything that happened and what I’ve tried so far — I’ll keep it structured.\n\n⸻\n\n🧩 System specs\n\t•\tMotherboard: MSI H310 M M2 Plus\n\t•\tCPU: Intel i3-8100\n\t•\tGPU: RX 580 2048SP 8 GB (Samsung memory, ex-mining)\n\t•\tOS: Windows 11 Pro (UEFI install, currently testing in CSM)\n\n⸻\n\n1️⃣ How it started\nValorant required TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, so I enabled both in BIOS and switched from Legacy/CSM to UEFI only.\n\nAfter saving, no video output — motherboard’s VGA LED stayed on.\n\nI cleared CMOS (battery + JBAT1), reinstalled Windows 11 UEFI on a GPT drive, and got video again only via the iGPU.\nWhenever the RX 580 was connected, there was no display.\n\n⸻\n\n2️⃣ What happens now\nIf I boot with the iGPU:\n\t•\tWindows loads fine.\n\t•\tRX 580 is detected in Device Manager, but with a yellow triangle (Error 43).\n\t•\tGPU-Z shows all specs:\n\t•\tDevice ID 1002 6FDF / Subsystem 1002 0B31\n\t•\tSubvendor: AMD/ATI\n\t•\tMemory: Samsung 8 GB GDDR5\n\t•\tUEFI: ✔ (true)\n\nIf I switch BIOS to PEG First (to use the RX 580 as main display), I get no video output at all — neither HDMI nor DP.\nThe card’s fans spin normally (not locked at 100 %), and power cables are fine.\n\n⸻\n\n3️⃣ What I’ve already tried\n\t•\tMultiple CMOS resets (battery + JBAT1).\n\t•\tReinstall Win 11 UEFI cleanly.\n\t•\tDDU + fresh AMD Adrenalin drivers.\n\t•\tDifferent HDMI cables, ports & monitors.\n\t•\tBIOS updates on the MSI board.\n\t•\tVarious BIOS settings (PEG First, Above 4G Decoding Off, etc).\n\t•\tAnd finally… VBIOS flashing.\n\n⸻\n\n4️⃣ Flashing attempts\n\t•\tMade backups using GPU-Z and AMDVBFlash GUI (not CMD).\n\t•\tWhen I try to restore or flash some ROMs — even my own backups — I get: PN mismatch\n(“Part Number Mismatch”)\n\n\t•\tForced flashing (-f) works but doesn’t fix the no-display problem.\n\t•\tTried multiple BIOS files from TechPowerUp:\n\t•\tRX 580 2048SP 8 GB (Samsung, UEFI Supported Yes)\n\t•\tSubvendor AMD (ATI), PowerColor, Sapphire\n\t•\tAll same Device ID 6FDF / 0B31\nResult: either still PN mismatch, or flash completes but video stays black.\n\n⸻\n\n5️⃣ Current status\n\t•\tWindows 11 (CSM mode), BIOS default.\n\t•\tRX 580 appears in Device Manager with yellow triangle.\n\t•\tWorks as secondary device only (via iGPU).\n\t•\tNo image if PEG First or iGPU disabled.\n\t•\tFans behave normally.\n\t•\tNo longer getting lines/artifacts (simply no output from GPU now).\n\n⸻\n\n6️⃣ What I believe is happening\n\t1.\tThe card has a mining VBIOS missing or corrupting the GOP driver (UEFI init module).\n\t2.\tBecause of that, it fails to initialize under UEFI, even though GPU-Z says “UEFI ✔”.\n\t3.\tError 43 in Device Manager confirms the driver can’t initialize it.\n\t4.\tThe PN mismatch blocks me from flashing even my original BIOS dump back.\n\n⸻\n\n7️⃣ What I need help with\n\t•\tDoes anyone have a stock UEFI VBIOS for:\n\nRX 580 2048SP 8 GB Samsung Memory  \nDevice ID 1002 6FDF – Subsystem 1002 0B31  \nSubvendor AMD (ATI)\n\n\tIs it safe to force flash a ROM with matching Device ID and memory type even if PN differs?\n\t•\tIs there a way to repair only the GOP section (using GOP Updater etc.) instead of flashing the whole ROM?\n\t•\tCould the VRAM itself cause consistent lines or no-output from BIOS onward, even when Windows detects the card?\n\n⸻\n\n8️⃣ TL;DR\n\t•\tRX 580 2048SP 8 GB (Samsung) ex-mining.\n\t•\tWorked fine under Legacy/CSM.\n\t•\tAfter switching to UEFI for Secure Boot/TPM, no video output.\n\t•\tOnly iGPU works.\n\t•\tGPU shows Error 43.\n\t•\tAll VBIOS flashes give “PN Mismatch” or no improvement.\n\t•\tNeed a confirmed UEFI-ready VBIOS or safe way to fix GOP.\n\n⸻\n\nAny help, working ROMs, or insight from people who fixed a 2048SP behaving like this would be seriously appreciated 🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️.\n",

Additionally, my ram usage never goes beyond 22gb so that isnt the issue either. I have also checled the temps, and they are perfectly fine.\n\nMy issue is that despite this, I will only be getting 50 - 70 fps (my monitor supports 165hz): While I understand this is fine, I think it is strange and a little annoying because it seems to me as if I could be getting more. This isnt just one game either. I have tested three games (The Finals, Marvel Rivals & Pacific Drive), all of which gave me the same results (pacific drive did get 90, but would not go over with low-medium settings). I have also made sure that my refresh rate is set to 165 in settings, there is no fps limit (or  I set it to 165) and have tried turning on and off v-sync, but nothing really helps. What could the problem be? \n\n  \nAlso changing the settings does increase the fps so I am thinking GPU related, but then again not by that much and at a point it doesnt really increase if I go to low from medium. \n\n\\*I would add a video of my benchmarks but I cant :(",

Yet it is not only happening in CSP since it was happening in pureref too before I updated it.\n\nA funny detail is when I move the mouse with a brush on, the eraser or any tool of this kind, it freezes on its current position for a very short time every second, but not with the zoom tool, nor the color picker nor the lasso tool etc.\n\nWhen I was moving the view in Pureref, it was freezing all the same, but only in folders that contained a certain number of image references. If the number was low, the freeze was not occurring. (since I updated it, it does not happen at all anymore)\n\nI know so little about tech, this is why I am here, if you have any advice for me about what I should do I would be very grateful.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nLittle note : The freeze also occurs on my main screen if I move clip studio paint or pureref on it, it doesn't simply happen on my tablet.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I have a strange issue that I can’t seem to find the solution for or pin-point the problem.\nI am running an ubuntu server on a former regular PC. It was running fine for a week or so, everything was installed and working fine.\nThen I had to stress test the server, which resulted in the system being under high load for around 5 hours, CPU and RAM being almost at full capacity constantly.\nThis resulted in a crash, which forced me to shut down the server manually.\nAfter restarting I have found that the system was trapped in a boot loop, with the ubuntu server OS attempting to start and then abruptly stopping at seemingly random stages during the boot, but then instantly restarting the boot process.\nI have ran several tests in order to try and pinpoint the issue, which lead to the following results:\n-looked at temperatures and voltages in BIOS\n   -> everything seems okay\n-ran an SSD test out of the BIOS\n   -> no issues found\n-ran a test program called memtest86+ to check RAM and CPU\n   -> test was passed successfully 3 consecutive times with zero Errors\n- checked several boot combinations leading to following results:\n   -> boot with SSD => results in boot loop\n   -> boot with SSD and an ubuntu USB flash drive => results in boot loop, no matter if I boot from the SSD or USB\n   -> boot with ubuntu USB flash drive and SSD removed => results in boot loop\n   -> boot with Windows USB and SSD removed => successfully loads into Windows installer\n   -> boot with Windows USB and SSD installed => results in boot loop, unable to load Windows installer\n\nAdditional info: the SSD is an M.2 SSD\nI did manage to successfully boot the system once with the SSD and an ubuntu USB flash drive, but after I removed the flash drive it instantly shut down and resumed the boot loop again, giving the error “out of memory” as well\nMost common error that show up during startup are “invalid environment block”, pretty much during every ubuntu boot attempt\n\nThe problem is that I don’t understand where the issue is exactly. Is it an issue with the UEFI not being able to load a Linux OS because it got corrupted, or did my SSD? And if it is the SSD, is the SSD hardware broken or is the SSD software corrupted somehow?\nDoes this testing or errors give anyone some kind of useful information or has someone encountered that kind of issue before? What should I do/test next in order to fix this? \nAny help would be much appreciated, thanks!",

This was a legit google search error. Soon after, a CMD prompt popped out of the blue with “netsh” title, but no visible commands running, empty cmd.\n\nI unplugged the internet, ran netsh reset commands from PowerShell, logged out from browser. Changed three of my most important passwords from my phone (unconnected to my wifi), then ran Malwarebytes but no threat found. Then I factory reset my WiFi router, didn’t even wait to check if strange DNS addresses or port forwadings were set. Right now my PC is cut from the internet.\n\nThis does look like a possible attack. How to proceed? I want to copy my photos and important docs from the PC and wipe it with a fresh Windows install. Are there ways to find out if the viruses latched to these kind of files (again, Malwarebytes found nothing sadly) so I won’t move the malware around? I am not great on cybersecurity apart from some obvious steps that I already done. ",

I had my pc idle with spiderman open while I was busy, it went to sleep (or i thought it did anyway) and wouldn't turn on after that. All the lights come on, and the fans too, but no signal on the monitor. So I took it to a shop and they said they *think* its the cpu is just bad. Theres no bent pins or anything tho. But it shouldn't be just bad right? These are very expensive parts, I would really like to know for a fact what's wrong with it.\n\nBut anyway, ive had a few problems in the past, like it would just shut off on me and go to bios. Or shut off and turn back on, or not want to turn on for a while, though it eventually did. Hopefully this helps diagnose it. Not sure what to do next I would really appreciate some guidance guys",

    "selftext": "This is my old phone (Pixel 2). I bought it used seven years ago and it never charged well (and now the camera is broken and the battery life is bad, and and ... but it's still good for Google Photos uploads. Anyway.) I assume the reason it's never charged well is that this little metal collar, inside the charging USB-C port, is loose. Recently when I was cleaning the lint out, I kind of hooked the collar upwards and cleaned under it, then pushed it back into place, but of course it's been bent all along. I realize I don't actually know if collar has become bent away from the *outer* wall of the female port and come towards the center, or whether it's actually separated from the *inner* wall (directly under the pins) and moved into the way. Also, I guess I don't even know if the collar is important or just serves as a guide to the plug. Is this collar what's serving as the opposite wire when charging? If I were to pull it out rather than trying to bend it back into place, would the phone still charge?\n\nHere's a pic: [https://imgur.com/a/wNaU7xZ](https://imgur.com/a/wNaU7xZ)",

Its especially annoying while on a discord call since whenever someone starts speaking or even when they're quiet, any sounds that their mics pick up end with this noice in my headphones. The issue seems to have something to do with the sample rate of the DAC because when i change it from 32-bit to 16-bit the cracking stops. I've read that fiio e10K tc supports 32-bit so i have no idea what the issue might be. If anyone knows anything i would be madly in love with you if you can help me. Thanks in advance.\n\nedit: just checked it it also stops when i plug my headphones into the line out port at the back and not the headphones port in the front",

They're pre-loaded with Win11 Pro, and I have not even taken them out of the shipping boxes.\n\nIn the past, I've brought laptops out of long-term storage, and had nothing but problems: batteries won't charge, or corrupted SSDs, or random BSODs, I even had one with a dead CMOS battery - usually within a week or so of getting the laptop set up for a new employee, if not while trying to set it up for a new employee.\n\nHow do you recommend I store these laptops to prevent the above issues?  Should I just leave them in their shipping boxes and not turn them on until needed?  I've heard removing the batteries is a good idea?  Can/Should I get them set up on the admin side and then store them?  Do I just need to schedule \"Turn on stored laptops\" days every so often?  \n\n(and yes, I realize the warranties are running out while they're in storage - not much I can do about that as buying them to store them long-term was not my call)",

The problem I'm having is that if I plug my Logitech headset into my desktop computer, regardless of whether it's the front or rear panel, the sound is great. However, if I use the splitter on my Logitech headset to plug in a phone headset (I've tried several different brands), the sound has an echo. I notice this echo especially when playing games and listening to music. The game I play the most is CS2, and it's impossible to play. Whenever I hear a gunshot, it feels like my head is going to explode. I just can't seem to find a solution. My Logitech speakers have great sound, and the headset is great too, but whenever I plug in any in-ear headphones, the sound immediately becomes echoey. I am using my g233 splitter but I bought a new splitter to try, but I don't think it will solve the problem. My motherboard is an MSI B550 Pro, and my sound card driver is up to date Realtek 6.0.9865.1 . What do you think is causing the problem? Should I get special in-ear headphones for desktop computers? After all, I need an aux splitter to use them. Does anyone else have any ideas?\n\n",

I also tried different audio ports on the PC, including the back panel and the front panel, but the problem is the same on both. Everything else on the PC seems normal.\n\nIs there something else I should check, like audio drivers or Realtek settings? Could this be a bad audio jack on the motherboard?

Since last Tuesday, 10/21, my PC has been randomly closing apps, shutting down completely (BSOD)w, etc. I took it to a local shop and have the guy look at it, but he was not able to figure anything out other than my CPU was running at meltdown level temperatures. New fans were installed and motherboard, CPU, GPU, and Windows updates/drivers were installed. Got the PC back and I am still having those same issues. Valorant crashes with faulty/corrupt files, Battlefield 6 does not even let me download the update because of corrupt files.\n\nFrom what I have read, this looks to be related to a faulty PSU? Would anyone be able to confirm or assist me in solving this? I am already \\~$500 down the drain and would rather not just throw parts at it. If needed, I should be able to provide any logs in Event Viewer, as long as you advise on how.\n\nMinidump below:\n\n[https://www.mediafire.com/file/h9clulx41xpsdd6/Reddit\\_Minidump.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/h9clulx41xpsdd6/Reddit_Minidump.zip/file)",

At first I thought the issue was of the streaming services, the sites or my mobile internet provider, but after I tried consuming those same medias on my tablet (Samsung galaxy tab s8+) the issue wouldn't be present. Same result if I tried to connect the tablet to my phone's mobile data, just to prove that the issue wasn't the internet provider itself but something related to the phone(the same browser apps where used to go into these sites btw).\n\nSorry for the bad English I'm not a native speaker, if something's not clear tell me and I'll try to explain myself better",

For example, Prime 95 RAM stress test did not return errors.\n\nSo, I assumed that this must be a memory controller error, the chances of BOTH sticks or RAM being faulty at the same time, is highly unlikely.\n\nAnd so, I replaced the mother board.\n\nUnfortunately, the intermittent errors remain, but sadly I no longer get bluescreens, and the event log simply records that the system recovered from an unexpected restart, with no capture of the causing event.\n\nI no longer have access to the sorts of testing gear and hardware swaps that I used to, so any test would require buying components, testing, and returning if not successful.\n\nBefore I embark on that exercise, I thought I'd open up for advice on what to do?\n\nShould I buy two new stuck of RAM\n\nReplace the processor\n\nGo all out and get a new motherboard and swap to AMD?\n\nJust accept the occasional error and save the effort and cost!\n\nThanks!

    "selftext": "Today I installed 2 preview updates. The first .NET Framework Preview update (KB5067931). And the second Update Preview (KB5067036) (26200.7019). This update seems to have screwed up the widget notifications, previously it happened that if you turned off the PC, the notifications would disappear and then be shown again. Now that doesn't happen, they stay. Sometimes it sends duplicates and above all at the moment it is only sending one and that's it, I tried to create a temporary profile on edge and it sent 4, but the same problem arose with the notifications not going away. What should I do? Is it a widget problem? About the update? Or the fact that Microsoft had problems today? I'm going crazy. I uninstalled and reinstalled the windows web experience pack, start esperience app but it didn't solve the problem. I am convinced that this update was a preview. And I can't even uninstall it anymore, neither from settings nor from recovery. What should I do? (I would add that the start experience app was updated today, I don't know if it was because of this update or not.",

    "title": "Microsoft destroyed TWO Xbox controllers when updating the drivers",
    "selftext": "So imagine this, one day I'm using my Xbox one controller, playing BeamNG on my pc (Windows 11). Out of nowhere, the controller disconnects, I try to reconnect it, but it says \"driver error\". So I look up how to update the driver, and use the \"Xbox accessories\" app to do it (BTW why do you have to sign in to a microsoft account to UPDATE A DRIVER???)\n\nAfter updating the driver, whatever I do, the controller either a) refuses to connect altogether (I have to spam the connect button for there to even be a chance) or b) it connects, and immediately disconnects.\n\nThe peculiar thing is, If I hold the controller 1cm from the Bluetooth/Wi-Fi antennas, the controller works perfectly. If I so much as move an INCH, the controller disconnects. So it seems like the problem is the signal strength, EVEN THOUGH IT WORKED PERFECTLY BEFORE.\n\nAfter battling with the first controller for a while, I get my old Xbox one controller from like 2016, and try to connect it to my PC. It works perfectly. I continue playing BeamNG, a happy man.\n\nBut then, after a few weeks, IT HAPPENS AGAIN. Same shit. Driver error. I update the driver. Can't connect anymore. And yes I tested it with another PC, the controllers still don't work.\n\nSo it seems I have been left with two paperweights, shaped like controllers. Thanks a lot Microsoft.\n\nBut seriously, is there anything I can do? Is there a way to downgrade drivers? Because obviously something shitty went on there.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo turns out you can revert firmware on the OLD controller using the this link pasted into the run dialog (found it on GitHub):\n\nxboxaccessories://firmwareupdate?legacyDowngrade=true\n\nWhich is crazy. You can't do it on the new controller since the firmware you would be reverting to is too old, and on top of everything, you can't even do it on the Xbox version of Xbox accessories anymore. You used to, but it was taken out... I see threads from FIVE YEARS AGO describing the same exact problem I am having now, and it still hasn't been fixed.\n\nSo now I have just ONE useless paperweight. Thanks again Microsoft.",

What really got me was that it would be on the App Store on some kind of app that you could cast another device to the tv when it turned on. It would be a different one everytime. I didn’t know what to do so I did restart my tv by unplugging it for a couple minutes and also doing a network restart and switching the network password. I just want to know if anyone thinks this could be someone attempting to hack into my tv and potentially get into other devices, I have cameras connected to the wifi as well so that would worry me, or if this is some weird bug or glitch. It hasn’t happened for a couple days now but I just want to make sure if I should be wary or not.",

The problem I'm having is that if I plug my Logitech headset into my desktop computer, regardless of whether it's the front or rear panel, the sound is great. However, if I use the splitter on my Logitech headset to plug in a phone headset (I've tried several different brands), the sound has an echo. I notice this echo especially when playing games and listening to music. The game I play the most is CS2, and it's impossible to play. Whenever I hear a gunshot, it feels like my head is going to explode. I just can't seem to find a solution. My Logitech speakers have great sound, and the headset is great too, but whenever I plug in any in-ear headphones, the sound immediately becomes echoey. I am using my g233 splitter but I bought a new splitter to try, but I don't think it will solve the problem. My motherboard is an MSI B550 Pro, and my sound card driver is up to date Realtek 6.0.9865.1 . What do you think is causing the problem? Should I get special in-ear headphones for desktop computers? After all, I need an aux splitter to use them. Does anyone else have any ideas?\n\n",

At first I thought the issue was of the streaming services, the sites or my mobile internet provider, but after I tried consuming those same medias on my tablet (Samsung galaxy tab s8+) the issue wouldn't be present. Same result if I tried to connect the tablet to my phone's mobile data, just to prove that the issue wasn't the internet provider itself but something related to the phone(the same browser apps where used to go into these sites btw).\n\nSorry for the bad English I'm not a native speaker, if something's not clear tell me and I'll try to explain myself better",

For example, Prime 95 RAM stress test did not return errors.\n\nSo, I assumed that this must be a memory controller error, the chances of BOTH sticks or RAM being faulty at the same time, is highly unlikely.\n\nAnd so, I replaced the mother board.\n\nUnfortunately, the intermittent errors remain, but sadly I no longer get bluescreens, and the event log simply records that the system recovered from an unexpected restart, with no capture of the causing event.\n\nI no longer have access to the sorts of testing gear and hardware swaps that I used to, so any test would require buying components, testing, and returning if not successful.\n\nBefore I embark on that exercise, I thought I'd open up for advice on what to do?\n\nShould I buy two new stuck of RAM\n\nReplace the processor\n\nGo all out and get a new motherboard and swap to AMD?\n\nJust accept the occasional error and save the effort and cost!\n\nThanks!

    "selftext": "So imagine this, one day I'm using my Xbox one controller, playing BeamNG on my pc (Windows 11). Out of nowhere, the controller disconnects, I try to reconnect it, but it says \"driver error\". So I look up how to update the driver, and use the \"Xbox accessories\" app to do it (BTW why do you have to sign in to a microsoft account to UPDATE A DRIVER???)\n\nAfter updating the driver, whatever I do, the controller either a) refuses to connect altogether (I have to spam the connect button for there to even be a chance) or b) it connects, and immediately disconnects.\n\nThe peculiar thing is, If I hold the controller 1cm from the Bluetooth/Wi-Fi antennas, the controller works perfectly. If I so much as move an INCH, the controller disconnects. So it seems like the problem is the signal strength, EVEN THOUGH IT WORKED PERFECTLY BEFORE.\n\nAfter battling with the first controller for a while, I get my old Xbox one controller from like 2016, and try to connect it to my PC. It works perfectly. I continue playing BeamNG, a happy man.\n\nBut then, after a few weeks, IT HAPPENS AGAIN. Same shit. Driver error. I update the driver. Can't connect anymore. And yes I tested it with another PC, the controllers still don't work.\n\nSo it seems I have been left with two paperweights, shaped like controllers. Thanks a lot Microsoft.\n\nBut seriously, is there anything I can do? Is there a way to downgrade drivers? Because obviously something shitty went on there.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo turns out you can revert firmware on the OLD controller using the this link pasted into the run dialog (found it on GitHub):\n\nxboxaccessories://firmwareupdate?legacyDowngrade=true\n\nWhich is crazy. You can't do it on the new controller since the firmware you would be reverting to is too old, and on top of everything, you can't even do it on the Xbox version of Xbox accessories anymore. You used to, but it was taken out... I see threads from FIVE YEARS AGO describing the same exact problem I am having now, and it still hasn't been fixed.\n\nSo now I have just ONE useless paperweight. Thanks again Microsoft.",

What really got me was that it would be on the App Store on some kind of app that you could cast another device to the tv when it turned on. It would be a different one everytime. I didn’t know what to do so I did restart my tv by unplugging it for a couple minutes and also doing a network restart and switching the network password. I just want to know if anyone thinks this could be someone attempting to hack into my tv and potentially get into other devices, I have cameras connected to the wifi as well so that would worry me, or if this is some weird bug or glitch. It hasn’t happened for a couple days now but I just want to make sure if I should be wary or not.",

    "title": "My mini PC GMKtec Nucbox G5 has a \"Your PC did not start correctly\" message, but I can't click on anything!",
    "selftext": "Basically, I downloaded a program that made me have to restart my PC. After that, it sent me to a normal loading screen, that later displayed a \"Preparing Automatic Repair\" message. After like 10 seconds, it switches to \"Diagnosing your PC\". In this part, my keyboard and mouse lights go off, and the PC gets stuck on the blue screen that says \"Your PC did not start correctly\".\n\nThere's two options there, one that says Restart, and the other one that says \"Advanced options\". I can't click on any of them. My keyboard and mouse are not responding.\n\nI tried messing around in the BIOS, powering the PC on and off repeatedly, and at this point I lost my mind. How did I get here right after trying to download a program!? It feels like a dream. \n\nI really don't want to have to send my PC away, and I'm fine with reseting the whole system because all my files are on a hard drive anyway, so any help with this problem would be more than welcome.\n",
