And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks.\n\nThis paper presents a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties.",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

(Still 87% Battery Health).\n\nWas searching through some drawers at home and came across my entire history of Apple cell phones.\n\nMy journey started with an IPhone 3G. Next was the iPhone 4s, then to iPhone 6s, and finally to my current iPhone XS Max. (Subtle pattern with “s” models I hadn’t realized)\n\nNot sure how I’ve made it to 2025 without a 5G iPhone yet but my current one does everything I need. It is showing its age now and won’t be getting anymore updates with iOS. It’s been a good run and hope to make a decision on a new one soon!",

    "selftext": "Hey r/iphone,\n\nI currently use a Samsung Galaxy S25+ but own an unused Galaxy S24 Ultra that I was planning to sell before pre-ordering the S25+, but couldn't find a buyer in time. Now, with Samsung's poor resale value and my growing interest in switching to iOS OR having an iPhone as a second phone (mostly due to the camera and smoother software), I'm thinking of trading the S24 Ultra for an iPhone. This way, I can test-drive iOS in real life (beyond videos and store demos) after years on Android, and if I hate it, I can just switch back to my S25+. If I like it, I keep the phone and I get what I want.\n\nQuestion: Based on current market values (Samsung resells low everywhere), what iPhone could I realistically trade for with the S24 Ultra? An iPhone 17 Pro Max (512GB) seems way out of reach, but maybe an iPhone 16 Pro Max if I throw in some extra cash? Or should I aim lower? Looking for advice on what to negotiate for when dealing with buyers/traders.\n\nThanks!",

I didn't have the right setting and the thief was able to put it in airplane mode shortly after grabbing it. I was traveling in London when it happened but within 30 minutes of it being snatch I was able to get back to my hotel and call my husband who put it in lost mode. On his device, it said lost mode was activate. He was not able to initiate an erase from his device though.\n\nI later logged into icloud from my laptop and initiated an erase. When I logged into icloud, it said Lost mode was pending, but on my husband's device, it said the Phone was in lost mode.\n\nI then initiated an erase of the phone. As of this morning, I have a new phone. On Find My, my stolen iPhone is sending location information, which has updated several times but hasn't moved. On my new phone it gives me the option to \"cancel erase\". On my laptop iCloud it says \"erase pending\". But when I call Apple and give them my IMEI they say the phone has Activation Lock and has been remotely erased. I'm so confused which one is correct. I don't see how it could be sending location without being connected to the internet, but if it is connected, it should be erased by now. Could the thief have some way of blocking it from erased? If so, why does Apple show it as erased?",

    "selftext": "After four days with the iPhone 17 Pro Max, coming from the 16 Pro Max, I’m honestly impressed this feels like a real step forward in the stuff I notice every day. Battery life is the headline win: I’m finishing long, mixed days (maps, messages, camera, social, a bit of streaming) with noticeably more left in the tank, and standby drain has been minimal once the first day indexing settled. The display is the star brighter in sunlight, super smooth when scrolling, and color accurate without blowing out highlights, so photos and videos look clean rather than oversaturated. Performance is instant across the board; apps pop open, heavy pages render fast, and I haven’t seen any heat spikes.\n\nThe cameras are more consistent in low light with better detail and steadier video, and portraits cut out subjects more cleanly. Connectivity has been rock solid on Wi-Fi and 4G, the speakers are fuller, and the haptics feel crisp. Small touches help too: Face ID is snappier at odd angles, the titanium build feels premium yet lighter, and iOS polish plus widgets/Live Activities make the phone feel useful without getting in the way. Overall, I’m enjoying the 17 Pro Max a lot it’s a confident, practical upgrade over the 16 Pro Max. ",

    "selftext": "The iPhone can be the best tool you own or the biggest attention trap — it all depends on how much noise you let through. Most people I know install dozens of apps and never touch the notification settings again. The result is constant buzzing, banners, and red dots that make it impossible to focus on anything for more than a few minutes.\n\nA few months back I started over. I reset all notifications and asked one question for each app: Do I really need to know this instantly?\nIf the answer wasn’t a clear yes, it got muted. Now only calls, messages, reminders, and genuinely time-sensitive alerts reach me. Everything else waits quietly until I check it myself.\n\nIt’s honestly changed how the phone feels — calmer, faster, and somehow more capable. When it vibrates now, I know it’s something that actually matters.\n\nHow do you handle it?\n• Do you rely on Focus modes or silence everything manually?\n• What notifications have you decided are truly worth keeping?\n• Have you found any setup that keeps your iPhone useful without overwhelming you?",

I normally turn a smidge of brightness on, so I can still see while my eyes adjust.  But… it’s great , if I ever want to use my phone before bed, and occasssionally need to look at the screen(for instance to skip a YouTube ad), the screen is so dim it doesn’t hurt my eyes or wake me up.  And if you ever have to wake up in middle of the night, the phone is perfect brightness for your night adjusted eyes.  Then also have a “brightness” widget which turns reduce white point off so you can undo it with one swipe and one click when you wake up(or give it a while and let your eyes adjust).\n\n10/10 hack for me.  I hope some others get use of it too… I’m sure this isn’t rocket science, and others have done it, but I hadn’t thought of it for years until yesterday… so figured I’d share.",

The Apple logo kept appearing, then the screen went black, and it repeated endlessly.\n\nI tried a forced restart, and after a few attempts, it showed the message “support.apple.com/iphone/restore.” Later that night, I connected it to my MacBook, opened Finder, and tried restoring it following Apple’s own instructions, but it failed with error 4013.\n\nOn Thursday, October 16, I contacted Apple Support. After explaining everything, they created a case for me and told me I needed to take the phone to an Apple Store for inspection. Since there are none in my country, they said it would have to be sent back to the U.S.\n\nThe next day, Friday, October 17, I reached out to the import store that handled the purchase to arrange the warranty process with Apple. That same night, before shipping it out, I decided to try one more thing. I managed to get the phone into DFU mode and performed a full firmware restore. This time it worked. The phone booted up normally, and I set it up as a new iPhone without restoring any backups.\n\nAfter that, it seemed completely fine. I didn’t use it much because I wanted to be sure the issue was really gone. Then, on Tuesday, October 21, I plugged it in to charge for the first time since restoring it, and within a few minutes, it started rebooting in a loop again, exactly like the first time.\n\nI tried another DFU restore, but it didn’t complete. The iPhone stayed on the restore screen, and Finder stopped recognizing it. Since then, it’s been stuck showing either the Apple logo or the restore message, and nothing seems to fix it.\n\nI’ve only ever used original Apple cables and chargers, and the iPhone hasn’t suffered any drops, water exposure, or damage of any kind. At this point, I’m convinced this is a hardware defect, possibly something with the power management IC (PMIC) or NAND connection, since the issue comes back whenever it’s connected to power.\n\nThe phone is still under warranty until October 13, 2026, so the import store will now send it back to the U.S. so that Apple can check it or replace it. Hopefully, the replacement process goes smoothly.\n\nI just wanted to post this here in case anyone has experienced something similar with an iPhone 17. I’m curious if this could be an isolated case or if more people are starting to see the same issue.",

I dabble in Fortnite mobile and COD, I consume a lot of media and need a decent battery for work I do inventory analysis and need to take photos and be able to pull up spreadsheets on my phone at all times.. so my most important question is. Since I’m shelling out the money and it’s only a $300 difference will I notice enough of a power and performance difference difference from the 14 pro to the air or will I wish I just spend the extra money and the 17 pro max?\n\nMy unimportant impractical Reasoning on wanting the air: sorry if it’s a long read but it means something to me\n\nIve always loved Apple and its innovation my my fist device was when I was 12 was an old 1st gen iPhone my Dad gave me when he got the 3GS and then gave me his 3Gs when he got the 4s I got the 4th gen iPod for Christmas later that year with the first front facing camera. my first real iPhone that wasn’t used like an iPod was the 5C when I was 15 I was always obsessed with Apple everytime they did something truly different it always sparked my interest. This being the thinnest iPhone yet/ thinnest phone on the market brings back a lot of memories from the Jony Ive days when they truly thought different and stayed true to Steve’s philosophy he was a big role model of mine growing up I did school projects on him in middle school and high school as college thesis on him. I think dropping titanium and going back to a heat forged aluminum alloy body is a major step downward in quality and innovation I often wonder what things would be like if they were both at the helm still this phone reminds me of old the old Apple I fell in love with",

Maybe I have to give it a quick charge once a day but I had to with my Pro Max as well.\n\nI guess I just don’t understand. If you know the downsides and don’t like them, then look at the other great models!\n\nThe iPhone 17 is definitely the best value but that doesn’t mean that the Air should be getting trashed.

Arent you guys bothered that most of the cases for 17 didnt cover the plateau? Im worried that it might get scratched no matter how protective the phone case is thats why it limits my options on picking any case i want.\n\nI also saw other comments that they do cases with open camera plateau because it hinders heat dissipation? \n\n\nAlthough jerryrig says that the scratches on the plateau itself can be removed by just wiping? Is this really true??\n\nThoughts on this? I really want to buy other cases that doesnt have camera plateau cover but im worried on scratches. Thank you!!\n\n\n",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "After using it for a while, I ended up returning the iPhone Air.\n\nDon’t get me wrong—it’s a good iPhone.\n\nFirst, my quick review:\n\nIn-hand feel: Extremely thin. It feels more like a concept device than a mass-produced phone. Super light—sometimes I forget it’s even in my pocket.\n\nColor/finish: Gorgeous. Honestly the best-looking iPhone I’ve seen. Except for black, the other colors are so elegant that I often set it face-down just to admire the back.\n\nSpeakers: Interesting setup. The speaker’s up top, which took some getting used to. There’s only one, but volume is fine—nothing amazing, just serviceable.\n\nCamera: Good enough and does its job. I came from a 16 Pro Max, so having only one camera forced me to be more deliberate with framing. It’s like slapping a single 24mm lens on a camera body—less is more. Colors and detail are solid.\n\nBattery: No complaints. For my use, it easily lasts a full workday.\n\nSo if everything’s good, why did I return it?\n\nBecause the more I looked at it, the more something felt… off. The phone could be better. That’s the feeling. Two cameras, two speakers, more niche features —something along those lines. And it feels like Apple could make it better this year, not “next year when the tech matures.”\n\nThen I re-checked the price.\n\nIt’s expensive. What are we doing here, Apple? They clearly could have done more but trimmed it down and still priced it at $999?\n\nI originally bought it for the thinness and looks. I assumed the missing pieces—1 camera, 1 speaker—were due to tech limits. But after using it, I realized this device doesn’t match its sticker price.\n\nSo I returned it. The iPhone itself isn’t the problem. The problem is how Apple priced it: too much cut, too high a price.\n\nNo—I’m not burning money for that. If they upgrade it to match the price, I’ll reconsider. This year, I’m out.",

This makes me feel like after installing this profile, my work basically has custody over my phone??\n\nAny thoughts on if installing a company profile seems ok to you?? I am also thinking I might buy a cheap second phone to use only for work since they will reimburse me anyway.\n\nThanks!!",

    "selftext": "Apparently the demand just isn’t there? This is a device with very real compromises (not a dig, just an objective statement) but I would’ve expected it to sell well enough overall. I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra. Now I wonder…",

    "selftext": "Every year we argue about titanium vs aluminum, bezels, battery cycles, camera bumps, charging speeds, AI buzzwords, etc… and then we completely ignore the one feature Apple shipped in the last few years that actually changed how you use the phone in daily life. Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey r/iphone,\n\nI currently use a Samsung Galaxy S25+ but own an unused Galaxy S24 Ultra that I was planning to sell before pre-ordering the S25+, but couldn't find a buyer in time. Now, with Samsung's poor resale value and my growing interest in switching to iOS OR having an iPhone as a second phone (mostly due to the camera and smoother software), I'm thinking of trading the S24 Ultra for an iPhone. This way, I can test-drive iOS in real life (beyond videos and store demos) after years on Android, and if I hate it, I can just switch back to my S25+. If I like it, I keep the phone and I get what I want.\n\nQuestion: Based on current market values (Samsung resells low everywhere), what iPhone could I realistically trade for with the S24 Ultra? An iPhone 17 Pro Max (512GB) seems way out of reach, but maybe an iPhone 16 Pro Max if I throw in some extra cash? Or should I aim lower? Looking for advice on what to negotiate for when dealing with buyers/traders.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I’ve already seen the in question asked but nobody really explains there wants and needs and I feel like you need to be specific when comparing but I’m  coming off the iPhone 14 Pro so either way the screen size is an upgrade and so is the chipset, camera doesn’t matter to me it’s same MP and I can live without telephoto and zoom, but I do take alot of photos and enjoy editing raw street photography i take in Lightroom but it’s not by any means a daily thing for me .  I dabble in Fortnite mobile and COD, I consume a lot of media and need a decent battery for work I do inventory analysis and need to take photos and be able to pull up spreadsheets on my phone at all times.. so my most important question is. Since I’m shelling out the money and it’s only a $300 difference will I notice enough of a power and performance difference difference from the 14 pro to the air or will I wish I just spend the extra money and the 17 pro max?\n\nMy unimportant impractical Reasoning on wanting the air: sorry if it’s a long read but it means something to me\n\nIve always loved Apple and its innovation my my fist device was when I was 12 was an old 1st gen iPhone my Dad gave me when he got the 3GS and then gave me his 3Gs when he got the 4s I got the 4th gen iPod for Christmas later that year with the first front facing camera. my first real iPhone that wasn’t used like an iPod was the 5C when I was 15 I was always obsessed with Apple everytime they did something truly different it always sparked my interest. This being the thinnest iPhone yet/ thinnest phone on the market brings back a lot of memories from the Jony Ive days when they truly thought different and stayed true to Steve’s philosophy he was a big role model of mine growing up I did school projects on him in middle school and high school as college thesis on him. I think dropping titanium and going back to a heat forged aluminum alloy body is a major step downward in quality and innovation I often wonder what things would be like if they were both at the helm still this phone reminds me of old the old Apple I fell in love with",

Curious, I checked mine, and it turned out that “M” stands for a new retail device, “F” for a refurbished device, “N” for a replacement device, and “P” for a personalized device with an engraving. I’m wondering if this information is accurate. Additionally, I’m interested in knowing what other people have and if there are any differences between the retail-sold and replacement models. ",

I didn't have the right setting and the thief was able to put it in airplane mode shortly after grabbing it. I was traveling in London when it happened but within 30 minutes of it being snatch I was able to get back to my hotel and call my husband who put it in lost mode. On his device, it said lost mode was activate. He was not able to initiate an erase from his device though.\n\nI later logged into icloud from my laptop and initiated an erase. When I logged into icloud, it said Lost mode was pending, but on my husband's device, it said the Phone was in lost mode.\n\nI then initiated an erase of the phone. As of this morning, I have a new phone. On Find My, my stolen iPhone is sending location information, which has updated several times but hasn't moved. On my new phone it gives me the option to \"cancel erase\". On my laptop iCloud it says \"erase pending\". But when I call Apple and give them my IMEI they say the phone has Activation Lock and has been remotely erased. I'm so confused which one is correct. I don't see how it could be sending location without being connected to the internet, but if it is connected, it should be erased by now. Could the thief have some way of blocking it from erased? If so, why does Apple show it as erased?",

I have a family member in the USA currently and i asked them if they can pick up a 17 Pro unlocked for me and bring it back to the EU (where we live). I was told the apple store employee confirmed it was \"unlocked\" but they're being paranoid about it NOT being unlocked for some reason. I tried using online services like IMEI24 but it didn't specify whether it was unlocked or not. Is there a way i can check if the phone is unlocked so i can use it with my EU carrier? They're not really \"technologically inclined\" so having them set it up and check in Settings is a bit out of the question and would prefer avoiding that if possible.",

    "selftext": "After using it for a while, I ended up returning the iPhone Air.\n\nDon’t get me wrong—it’s a good iPhone.\n\nFirst, my quick review:\n\nIn-hand feel: Extremely thin. It feels more like a concept device than a mass-produced phone. Super light—sometimes I forget it’s even in my pocket.\n\nColor/finish: Gorgeous. Honestly the best-looking iPhone I’ve seen. Except for black, the other colors are so elegant that I often set it face-down just to admire the back.\n\nSpeakers: Interesting setup. The speaker’s up top, which took some getting used to. There’s only one, but volume is fine—nothing amazing, just serviceable.\n\nCamera: Good enough and does its job. I came from a 16 Pro Max, so having only one camera forced me to be more deliberate with framing. It’s like slapping a single 24mm lens on a camera body—less is more. Colors and detail are solid.\n\nBattery: No complaints. For my use, it easily lasts a full workday.\n\nSo if everything’s good, why did I return it?\n\nBecause the more I looked at it, the more something felt… off. The phone could be better. That’s the feeling. Two cameras, two speakers, more niche features —something along those lines. And it feels like Apple could make it better this year, not “next year when the tech matures.”\n\nThen I re-checked the price.\n\nIt’s expensive. What are we doing here, Apple? They clearly could have done more but trimmed it down and still priced it at $999?\n\nI originally bought it for the thinness and looks. I assumed the missing pieces—1 camera, 1 speaker—were due to tech limits. But after using it, I realized this device doesn’t match its sticker price.\n\nSo I returned it. The iPhone itself isn’t the problem. The problem is how Apple priced it: too much cut, too high a price.\n\nNo—I’m not burning money for that. If they upgrade it to match the price, I’ll reconsider. This year, I’m out.",

    "selftext": "Apparently the demand just isn’t there? This is a device with very real compromises (not a dig, just an objective statement) but I would’ve expected it to sell well enough overall. I genuinely hoped it wouldn’t be another iPhone Mini, but this isn’t what I meant. Does this feel accurate for you, fellow Redditors? Is this one just going to be a slow burn or is it going to fizzle? And if so, why? The b-word is too much a low hanging fruit and they did introduce the MagSafe pack for those times when one really needs the extra juice. If anything I would expect the camera to be the trade-off that might be stopping people, especially those they were already on the iPhone Pro, which was the same price point last year. Especially like to hear from any people that went from a 15 or 16 Pro to the Air. What did you miss? Do you think it will be worth it long time or do you think you may end up trading in again next year? (Or sooner?) This is the first major change in design Apple has made in quite a while so it’s interesting times.\n\nAll I know for sure is I’m in a pretty iPhone heavy microcosm and I’m the kind of guy that notices other people’s devices, as I’m always half feeling the urge to upgrade. But I’ve yet to see *one* iPhone Air in the wild although I’ve seen multiple 17 Pro’s — can’t mistake that plateau and triple array — while I’d expected to see at a couple Airs though.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that Apple anticipated the air itself might be a flash in the pan and it’s prepared to completely replace it with an “iPhone Fold” or “iPhone Ultra.” Although I expected next year’s lineup to be iPhone, iPhone Air 2, iPhone Ultra. Now I wonder…",

    "selftext": "Every year we argue about titanium vs aluminum, bezels, battery cycles, camera bumps, charging speeds, AI buzzwords, etc… and then we completely ignore the one feature Apple shipped in the last few years that actually changed how you use the phone in daily life. Dynamic Island wasn’t “new hardware”, it was a UX decision. Apple took a problem (the camera cutout) and turned it into UI real estate. Music controls, navigation, timers, live activities, authentication, calls, AirPods, it all lives there now. You don’t think about it, you just use it. And that’s the whole point: good design disappears into behavior.\n\nTake it away tomorrow and I guarantee most people would feel something is “missing” immediately. I can’t say the same about the Action Button or about most of the “new” things Apple ships lately.\n\nThe funniest part to me is that Android manufacturers copy Apple instantly when something is shallow (removing accessories, changing ports, renaming modes, etc), but after 3 years nobody even tried to copy the Dynamic Island. Not because they don’t want to, but because that kind of idea requires real integration between hardware and system UI, not just a checkbox feature.\n\nTo me, Dynamic Island is one of the most quietly brilliant Apple moves in years, and people treat it like a minor bullet point.\n\n",

    "title": "Trading My Unused Galaxy S24 Ultra for an iPhone – What Can I Realistically Get?",
    "selftext": "Hey r/iphone,\n\nI currently use a Samsung Galaxy S25+ but own an unused Galaxy S24 Ultra that I was planning to sell before pre-ordering the S25+, but couldn't find a buyer in time. Now, with Samsung's poor resale value and my growing interest in switching to iOS OR having an iPhone as a second phone (mostly due to the camera and smoother software), I'm thinking of trading the S24 Ultra for an iPhone. This way, I can test-drive iOS in real life (beyond videos and store demos) after years on Android, and if I hate it, I can just switch back to my S25+. If I like it, I keep the phone and I get what I want.\n\nQuestion: Based on current market values (Samsung resells low everywhere), what iPhone could I realistically trade for with the S24 Ultra? An iPhone 17 Pro Max (512GB) seems way out of reach, but maybe an iPhone 16 Pro Max if I throw in some extra cash? Or should I aim lower? Looking for advice on what to negotiate for when dealing with buyers/traders.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I’ve already seen the in question asked but nobody really explains there wants and needs and I feel like you need to be specific when comparing but I’m  coming off the iPhone 14 Pro so either way the screen size is an upgrade and so is the chipset, camera doesn’t matter to me it’s same MP and I can live without telephoto and zoom, but I do take alot of photos and enjoy editing raw street photography i take in Lightroom but it’s not by any means a daily thing for me .  I dabble in Fortnite mobile and COD, I consume a lot of media and need a decent battery for work I do inventory analysis and need to take photos and be able to pull up spreadsheets on my phone at all times.. so my most important question is. Since I’m shelling out the money and it’s only a $300 difference will I notice enough of a power and performance difference difference from the 14 pro to the air or will I wish I just spend the extra money and the 17 pro max?\n\nMy unimportant impractical Reasoning on wanting the air: sorry if it’s a long read but it means something to me\n\nIve always loved Apple and its innovation my my fist device was when I was 12 was an old 1st gen iPhone my Dad gave me when he got the 3GS and then gave me his 3Gs when he got the 4s I got the 4th gen iPod for Christmas later that year with the first front facing camera. my first real iPhone that wasn’t used like an iPod was the 5C when I was 15 I was always obsessed with Apple everytime they did something truly different it always sparked my interest. This being the thinnest iPhone yet/ thinnest phone on the market brings back a lot of memories from the Jony Ive days when they truly thought different and stayed true to Steve’s philosophy he was a big role model of mine growing up I did school projects on him in middle school and high school as college thesis on him. I think dropping titanium and going back to a heat forged aluminum alloy body is a major step downward in quality and innovation I often wonder what things would be like if they were both at the helm still this phone reminds me of old the old Apple I fell in love with",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course).

Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "title": "WhatsBerry - WhatsApp for older unsupported devices",
    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Samsung is canceling the upcoming s26 edge completly. but should it?\n\nCurrent reports say its because of poor sales of the 25 edge (only 178k in the first month) vs the other s series (s25 ultra with 1.5m, s25 with more than 1m). \n\nFor my opinion, the poor sales of the s25 edge were caused only because thats a new technology and it was mostly a prototype phone.\nIt had many problems and seemed rushed and unfinished (wasnt that thin, small battery, no telephoto camera). It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

I created an app that helps you to keep track of all your data in one simple place.\n\n# Download\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franko.privacyguard)\n\nI first released it 4 years ago, but Google removed it stating it violates the terms of use. Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

I can hit it 3 or 4 times then it finally shows. It seems like it might be specific to chrome and I noticed it way more while on reddit lol. Crazy stuff I know.

Tested via multiple Device ID apps from PlayStore and later confirmed via Frida Hooking. \n\nManually checking via adb shell was confirming the GSF ID is existing. \n\nI was searching the internet and trying to find any documentations about GSF ID related changed in A16, but I found nothing official.\n\nThat's why I was opening this post in order to search for confirmations if it's official, that A16 does not give access to the GSF ID anymore to normal apps? \n\nAnyone could help me out on that question?

    "selftext": "I have two 5a's and both went dead within a few days of each other, and both in the same way more or less. \n\nI was on a road trip and using Android Auto for mapping and playing podcasts, stopped to take some photos, and boom, black screen of death. No response at all, the car no longer saw the bluetooth, pressing and holding buttons did nothing, just dead. Wouldn't even show the \"charging\" icon when plugged in.\n\nI transferred the sim to the backup, synced the contacts, and went on with my trip. As a former work phone it had fewer apps installed and I didn't try to sync them over cellular. No Waze or podcasts, but I could still use Google maps, and did.  Three days later, same thing.  Stopped at an overlook, got out to take a photo and boom.\n\nHere's were it gets weirder (to me). Unloading the car after the trip I picked up the original phone an bumped a key or the screen and got the \"insufficient charge\" icon on the screen (battery with a sliver of red at the bottom). I plugged it in and is started charging and after I let it charge for a while it rebooted like nothing happened (after I put the sim back in it).\n\nWhat's the odds on the other doing the same? I used it as my camera for most of the vacation and would like to recover the photos if possible. It's been two days already, but I don't know how long its battery will hold out.  It's had less use and I don't know how long the other one took before the battery drained enough to break it out of what ever logic loop it was stuck in.",

As the smartphone was always used with a case, etc., it was in perfect condition apart from the reported fault (no other defects known, even took photos of it beforehand). During the repair process, I was informed yesterday that there were ‘audio problems’ and ‘frame cracks’, which would cost approximately 200€ to repair. However, these must be paid for, otherwise the display fault cannot be repaired.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a no-go business practice, as there was no visible damage to the Pixel other than the display fault.\n\nI have now requested a detailed damage report with photo documentation from Google, which I will forward to the European Consumer Protection Agency.\n\nThis will probably be my last Pixel.",

    "selftext": "I was just messing around with settings on my P10 Pro and I discovered an interesting setting. \n\nGames and emulators have been pretty meh on here so far.  Everyone assumed it's a driver issue.  And I think they're right because enabling something called ANGLE seems to improve performance and fixes compatibility for a lot of games.  Here's what I found:\n\nSettings-System-Developer Options-ANGLE Preferences (under Debugging).\n\nGo to the app you want to try and change the OpenGL driver from \"default\" to \"angle\".  Restart the app and give it a go.\n\n**My tests so far:**\n\nDolphin Emulator - Noticeably improved and more stable framerate in Star Fox Adventures and Metroid Prime.  These were both dropping sub-100% emulation speed.  After ANGLE is enabled, they haven't dropped below 100% speed.\n\nRunescape - Framerate and stability massively improved.  Graphical glitches disappeared.  Runs much, much better.\n\nsrceng (via idtech4a++) - Half Life 2 now works.  No more black textures, though there are some glitches still.  It was completely unplayable before this fix.  Portal unfortunately has a nasty flicker I can't seem to fix, but at least it runs now.\n\nOpenMW 0.50 - Seems to be quite a bit more stable with my modded setup.  Still some stutters here and there, but seems smoother overall.\n\nSubnautica - This ran ok to begin with, but it feels overall smoother and more stable with ANGLE enabled.\n\nI don't fully understand what this does, but I believe it's a translation layer between the GPU and Vulkan, translating each GPU call into something the GPU fully understands.  And since the PowerVR GPU drivers are currently buggy as hell, this fixes a lot of issues.\n\nI feel like this basically confirms a lot of the GPU issues are a driver issue (updated soon hopefully?!) since the translation layer fixes quite a bit from what I can tell.",

I am just about to graduate school and I proimised myself to get a new phone if I got a full time offer (which I did!) - Mint Mobile had the Pixel 10 Pro XL up for grabs for just $600, so I ended up getting Jade. I got the Otterbox Symmetry Case to show off the color.\n\nI prev. used a Pixel 6 with Spigen's Wallet case ([reference](https://partners.spigen.com/products/pixel-6-series-case-slim-armor-cs?variant=44016021471432)) - since my phone has my work ID and transit card, I'm fine if I forget my wallet, which I would like to continue.\n\nI wanted to get a matching snap-on wallet for the Jade 10 Pro XL, so I ordered:  \n\\- MOFT [Earthen Beige](https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Magnetic-Compatible-Adjustment-Magsafe/dp/B0DJ73FP6X?th=1): Unlike the images, I received a grey  thing.  \n  \n\\- So I have ordered MOFT's [Peach Pink](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDB1NFXC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1). I fear being a guy it will come off as girlish? Not that I care if it matches the phone well.\n\n\\- Bellroy has a Tahini color wallet too - [link](https://bellroy.com/products/mag-wallet?color=innovera_tahini&material=innovera#slide-0)\n\nThese are just a few I had shortlisted, but if by chance any of you had better recommendations that matches the gold-ish accents or just the jade colorway that will be much appreciated!",

If I EVER try to record a video with flash it stops becusase It gets too hot. One time it got too hot even though it was -20 C outside. Even watching you tube videos too. at a low brightness\n\n\\-Battery life is comically short. I even have it set to the lower refresh rate and lower resolution. But its still terrible\n\n\\-Crashing. It cashes at least once a week, where I will be doing anything even during a important call and it will just fully shut down and not turn on for about 10-20 minutes. One time it turned off for 8 hours. then randomly turned back on when I was about to bring it to a store. Each time it was at a decently high battery percentage \n\n\\-editing photos takes way too long. even cropping, or writing on images will take a minute sometimes.\n\n\\-I have deleted so many things so its not because storage or things running in the background\n\n\\-It is somehow worse in every way then my old Samsung a71? which is older and much cheaper? \n\n  \nIm so disappointed because I thought it was going to be a great phone and it was my first more expensive phone yet it did so terribly.

After perusing the available phones with my carrier, I found the pixel phones to have a nice look and I’ve heard they have good cameras! My problem… it feels like I can’t research a phone without finding reddit people listing at least 10 horrible things about it. \n\nSo, I’m wondering how the switch is from iPhone to Pixel. How does the battery life compare? For context, I’m looking at the Pixel 9 Pro, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. I have embarrassing high screen time. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows on my phone (through streaming apps). I also play some games that demand a lot of battery life (ex. Pokemon Go). \n\nFor pictures, I want to take beautiful pictures of my loved ones. That’s all I really care about. I don’t like the beautified, filtered look of photos from Samsung. \n\nI use a lot of google products already (google calendar, gmail, google photos, etc.)\n\nThanks for any/all advice!!",

Unfortunately, my screen had a crack in the upper corner, and as per their policy, they had to replace it. So I had to pay INR 7249. Got it in 4 hours. They urged a five-star review, and that's fine.\n\nWithin 3 weeks, the screen started going black in the area where the fingerprint sensor is. I took it to the store and they agreed as it was <90 days for a free replacement. \n\nAfter a while, they opened it and they said they found water inside the phone. I casually mentioned, it must have been the rain. They charged me another INR 850 for an investigation, and they came back with a back panel and droplets in a specific area. Not trying to accuse them, but it did look fresh. Not sure any phone can handle that. \n\nUltimately rejected the warranty and said it'll cost me INR 26K for a new display, motherboard, camera and battery, so maybe get a new phone. I asked the lady, but how is the time being shown if the motherboard is gone? She said it's temporary and it'll stop working soon.\n\n  \nIt's been more than 10 days since this incident, and my phone works perfectly well apart from the display. I am using Google Talkback and Google Assistant, and it works just as normal (Alarms, calls, messages). Had to use a USB keyboard to unlock after switching on, else it unlocks via face. All with a blank display. I have important data and banking apps in there.\n\nTried writing to the Google service, but they don't care. Scripted emails about how they are \"actively investigating\" for more than a week.\n\n  \nWhat are my options here? Have any of you faced any similar situations? \n\n  \nPS: Even tried casting the phone using an HDMI cable, unfortunately, it's available from Pixel 8 series. ",

As the smartphone was always used with a case, etc., it was in perfect condition apart from the reported fault (no other defects known, even took photos of it beforehand). During the repair process, I was informed yesterday that there were ‘audio problems’ and ‘frame cracks’, which would cost approximately 200€ to repair. However, these must be paid for, otherwise the display fault cannot be repaired.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a no-go business practice, as there was no visible damage to the Pixel other than the display fault.\n\nI have now requested a detailed damage report with photo documentation from Google, which I will forward to the European Consumer Protection Agency.\n\nThis will probably be my last Pixel.",

    "selftext": "I was just messing around with settings on my P10 Pro and I discovered an interesting setting. \n\nGames and emulators have been pretty meh on here so far.  Everyone assumed it's a driver issue.  And I think they're right because enabling something called ANGLE seems to improve performance and fixes compatibility for a lot of games.  Here's what I found:\n\nSettings-System-Developer Options-ANGLE Preferences (under Debugging).\n\nGo to the app you want to try and change the OpenGL driver from \"default\" to \"angle\".  Restart the app and give it a go.\n\n**My tests so far:**\n\nDolphin Emulator - Noticeably improved and more stable framerate in Star Fox Adventures and Metroid Prime.  These were both dropping sub-100% emulation speed.  After ANGLE is enabled, they haven't dropped below 100% speed.\n\nRunescape - Framerate and stability massively improved.  Graphical glitches disappeared.  Runs much, much better.\n\nsrceng (via idtech4a++) - Half Life 2 now works.  No more black textures, though there are some glitches still.  It was completely unplayable before this fix.  Portal unfortunately has a nasty flicker I can't seem to fix, but at least it runs now.\n\nOpenMW 0.50 - Seems to be quite a bit more stable with my modded setup.  Still some stutters here and there, but seems smoother overall.\n\nSubnautica - This ran ok to begin with, but it feels overall smoother and more stable with ANGLE enabled.\n\nI don't fully understand what this does, but I believe it's a translation layer between the GPU and Vulkan, translating each GPU call into something the GPU fully understands.  And since the PowerVR GPU drivers are currently buggy as hell, this fixes a lot of issues.\n\nI feel like this basically confirms a lot of the GPU issues are a driver issue (updated soon hopefully?!) since the translation layer fixes quite a bit from what I can tell.",

No response at all, the car no longer saw the bluetooth, pressing and holding buttons did nothing, just dead. Wouldn't even show the \"charging\" icon when plugged in.\n\nI transferred the sim to the backup, synced the contacts, and went on with my trip. As a former work phone it had fewer apps installed and I didn't try to sync them over cellular. No Waze or podcasts, but I could still use Google maps, and did.  Three days later, same thing.  Stopped at an overlook, got out to take a photo and boom.\n\nHere's were it gets weirder (to me). Unloading the car after the trip I picked up the original phone an bumped a key or the screen and got the \"insufficient charge\" icon on the screen (battery with a sliver of red at the bottom). I plugged it in and is started charging and after I let it charge for a while it rebooted like nothing happened (after I put the sim back in it).\n\nWhat's the odds on the other doing the same? I used it as my camera for most of the vacation and would like to recover the photos if possible. It's been two days already, but I don't know how long its battery will hold out.  It's had less use and I don't know how long the other one took before the battery drained enough to break it out of what ever logic loop it was stuck in.",

    "selftext": "My P7P is completely busted (screen only works with a mouse) so I can't take advantage of any trade in deals. I'm getting kind of nervous to keep using it as it has started to drain within a few days of no use (I mainly use my connected Pixel watch for everything and rarely actually use the phone). I need a flagship camera, so the P8P seems to be the best thing I can afford.\n\nGoogle no longer has the P8P on their store as far as I can tell. I'd rather just buy new to avoid any potential headache with refurbished. So eBay seems to be my only option.\n\nI'm a little hesitant because all of the stores selling seem very similar, and none of them have above 98 something % feedback. Idk, they just seem suspicious. I'm just wondering if there is anything I should watch out for in terms of getting a fake phone or one that's been tampered with. \n\nFor example, this is one of the listings I was looking at: [https://ebay.us/m/9qdCE4](https://ebay.us/m/9qdCE4)\n\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks!",

As the smartphone was always used with a case, etc., it was in perfect condition apart from the reported fault (no other defects known, even took photos of it beforehand). During the repair process, I was informed yesterday that there were ‘audio problems’ and ‘frame cracks’, which would cost approximately 200€ to repair. However, these must be paid for, otherwise the display fault cannot be repaired.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a no-go business practice, as there was no visible damage to the Pixel other than the display fault.\n\nI have now requested a detailed damage report with photo documentation from Google, which I will forward to the European Consumer Protection Agency.\n\nThis will probably be my last Pixel.",

    "selftext": "I was just messing around with settings on my P10 Pro and I discovered an interesting setting. \n\nGames and emulators have been pretty meh on here so far.  Everyone assumed it's a driver issue.  And I think they're right because enabling something called ANGLE seems to improve performance and fixes compatibility for a lot of games.  Here's what I found:\n\nSettings-System-Developer Options-ANGLE Preferences (under Debugging).\n\nGo to the app you want to try and change the OpenGL driver from \"default\" to \"angle\".  Restart the app and give it a go.\n\n**My tests so far:**\n\nDolphin Emulator - Noticeably improved and more stable framerate in Star Fox Adventures and Metroid Prime.  These were both dropping sub-100% emulation speed.  After ANGLE is enabled, they haven't dropped below 100% speed.\n\nRunescape - Framerate and stability massively improved.  Graphical glitches disappeared.  Runs much, much better.\n\nsrceng (via idtech4a++) - Half Life 2 now works.  No more black textures, though there are some glitches still.  It was completely unplayable before this fix.  Portal unfortunately has a nasty flicker I can't seem to fix, but at least it runs now.\n\nOpenMW 0.50 - Seems to be quite a bit more stable with my modded setup.  Still some stutters here and there, but seems smoother overall.\n\nSubnautica - This ran ok to begin with, but it feels overall smoother and more stable with ANGLE enabled.\n\nI don't fully understand what this does, but I believe it's a translation layer between the GPU and Vulkan, translating each GPU call into something the GPU fully understands.  And since the PowerVR GPU drivers are currently buggy as hell, this fixes a lot of issues.\n\nI feel like this basically confirms a lot of the GPU issues are a driver issue (updated soon hopefully?!) since the translation layer fixes quite a bit from what I can tell.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion.

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

    "selftext": "I was a Galaxy user for about 10 years (starting with the S1 until the S7) and one thing that always drove me crazy was how my phones would slow down after a year or two. I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I’m going to start to train to load and start. ",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use?

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Btw the objective was to see which Magic Eraser works better. Although Samsungs eraser was sooo much better... but on a different picture. Because my camera couldn't capture one vehicle in the background clearly.\n\nI do have Quick Tap Shutter on and Prioritize Focus over speed off. I thought Samsung could do better because it's pretty much iPhone 15 or 16 equivalent. Idk I thought camera was kinda close to iPhone but phone camers, i think iPhone wins hands down.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "**One UI 8 Watch Upgrade**\n\n**Get things done**\n\nStay on top of important tasks with the Now bar  \nCheck the information you need right now and start essential features straight from your watch face. Ongoing tasks will appear in the Now bar at the bottom of your watch face so you can check key information quickly.\n\nDo more with double pinch  \nJust pinch your thumb and index finger together twice to scroll through notifications, control music, take pictures, and more. You can also customize what happens when you double pinch on the watch face, music controller, as well as alarm, calendar, and reminder alerts. Choose the actions you need most in each situation.\n\nMark reminders as important  \nMark reminders as important by tapping the Star icon. You can choose to have important reminders pinned to the top of the list to make sure you notice them.\n\nNew charging effects  \nWhen your watch is charging, the new screen layout and animations make it easier to check the current battery level and remaining charging time.\n\n**Stay connected**\n\nEasily respond to notifications and alerts  \nUse gestures to quickly respond to notifications and alerts. When a notification appears, you can double pinch to view the details or send a reply. You can also shake your wrist to return to the watch face.\n\nEnhanced notification view  \nNotifications on your watch are now easier to use with an attractive new design. Notifications from the same app are stacked vertically, allowing you to view more notifications with fewer swipes.\n\nSmarter notification settings  \nIt's now easier to decide how to receive notifications from your phone on your watch. If you choose Smart device selection, notifications will appear on your phone only when you're using it and on your watch when you're not using your phone. If you choose Always show on both, notifications will always appear on both your phone and watch.\n\n**Upgrade your health**\n\nRunning coach  \nWhether you're a beginner or an experienced runner, the new Running coach feature in Samsung Health provides personalized training programs and tips to help you run farther and faster while minimizing the risk of injury.\n\nBedtime guidance  \nGet to sleep at the right time so you wake up feeling refreshed. The new Bedtime guidance feature analyzes your sleep data and recommends the best time to go to sleep each night.\n\nMindfulness  \nManage stress and anxiety in your daily life with the new Mindfulness feature in Samsung Health. You can keep track of your moods and emotions and practice breathing exercises to reduce stress.\n\n**Tailored to you**\n\nFind the perfect watch face  \nIt's now easier to find the watch face that's right for you. Just choose a few keywords such as your preferred style, color, and information to show. The best matches will be suggested from our collection of more than 300 watch faces.\n\nRecommended watch faces  \nDiscover new watch faces that you might like. Watch faces with colors, style, or information similar to your current watch face will be recommended on the watch face selection screen.\n\nCreate your own tiles  \nCreate your own custom tiles that show the information you need. You can even combine information from different apps into a single tile. You can include weather information, calendar events, reminders, and more.\n\nPersonalized Apps screen  \nFeatured apps now appear at the top of your Apps screen to give you quick access to the apps you need the most. Apps will be featured based on how often you use them and other usage patterns. You can also view your apps as a list with names instead of only icons.\n\nChoose calendars to show on your watch  \nYou can now choose which calendars to show in the Calendar app on your watch. You can show all of the same calendars that are on your phone or customize to show only the calendars you need.\n\n  \n**Sadly there are no any:**\n\n  \nTrack your vascular load  \nUse your Galaxy Watch to measure your vascular load, which is the amount of stress on your blood vessels. First, take a baseline measurement, then you'll be able to see when your vascular load gets higher or lower over time.  \n  \nCheck your antioxidant intake  \nThe Antioxidant index (Labs) feature on your watch detects the level of carotenoids in your skin. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant contained in fruits and vegetables that can help prevent physical aging.\n\nP.S. It's not bad update overall, but most important features as always Samsung hold just for Ultra models.",

    "selftext": "I have to say, despite how much I love my own personal Galaxy Watch 7 44mm + Galaxy Ring combo, I think that the Fit 3 deserves some tremendous respect for getting so many things right.\n\nI've set three different people up with a Fit 3 so far, with great success.  \n\n\\-It's cheap.  Not everyone is into spending hundreds on a Smartwatch or Ring.\n\n\\-It has great battery life.  I'm fine with the shorter battery life of my Watch 7, but I know that none of these people I set up with a Fit 3 would put up with having to charge their watch every 1-2 days.\n\n\\-It's not bulky.  I don't consider my Watch 7 bulky either, certainly not compared to something like a Watch Ultra, but the Fit 3 is a truly lightweight device.\n\n\\-Has all the basic smartwatch features covered.  I'm amazed how well it integrates with Google Messages when receiving texts.  It's great that it still shows you when you are getting a call (even though you can't answer them).  It handles all the core health tracking.  Built-in find-your-phone feature, fall alerts, etc.\n\n\\-Low maintenance.  No apps that need to update constantly.  The Fit 3 itself turns on and off very quick.  This also makes it a great backup watch.  My old Watch 4 Classic on the other-hand, I have to turn it on periodically just to keep the apps updated and it takes a while, uses maybe 10% of the battery just finishing the boot-up process.\n\n  \nNow obviously each watch has it's own pros and cons, but the Fit 3 does a really great job at not just being a cheap watch, but actually doing certain things better than the more expensive watches and creating a great option to bring a big group of people into the Samsung smartwatch / Samsung health ecosystem.",

    "title": "Here's how I fixed up my galaxy watch 8c battery issue.",
    "selftext": "This is a post to help you folks who are stuck with a watch that dies in 8 hours.\n\nBefore I start, let me just clarify that I don't have a fixed solution for you. I'll tell you what I tried, and what worked.\n\nI got my galaxy watch 8c LTE edition on September 13th. Bought it from a store, enabled whatever I wanted, used it.\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that the battery dies within the day.\n\nI started measuring. I was wearing it to sleep, I was using it to exercise, I was using it like how a proper smart watch is supposed to be used. On an average I got 10-12 hours out of it. 10% battery drain per hour.\n\nI started looking into solutions. Searched reddit, forums, samsung issue resolutions.\n\nSome had this issue because of the Gemini constantly listening. Some had it because they had AOD on. But these folks already had a battery life that spanned atleast 20+ hours. This fix wasn't for me.\n\nThen the next group of people had a solution - clear the cache partition or do a factory reset. Or do both.\nFor some, the cache clear worked. For some the reset did. For some, doing both did it.\n\nSo started my 2 week long experimenting on improving battery life.\n\nClearing cahe partition didn't do much. I cleared again. Nothing.\nI reset the watch. Still showed 12 hours.\n\nSomeone pointed out to do it twice - no idea why - but tried that.\nStill the same.\n\nAfter 3 days of trial and error, my watch suddenly showed 22hrs.\nI didn't do anything much. I had cleared the partition and reset the watch earlier that day.\n\nHoping it would improve again, I repeated this process - twice.\nAfter setting it up as a new watch for God knows how many times, it switched back to showing 12-15h.\n\nHere is when I noticed that the battery drain has a direct correlation with the network settings.. \nI checked my connection settings - wifi, mobile data etc were set to auto. That would mean that when my phone was away, they would use what's needed and would be off when I'm using it with my phone nearby. \n\nBut it seemed that the watch was not turning it off. It was connected to my watch, but not always through bluetooth. It would switch sometimes to wifi and LTE even when the phone was in my pocket. \n\nThis was the root cause. Don't know what caused it, but my samsung phone was not exactly paired to my samsung watch.\n\nI cleared cache partition. That didn't do much. I hard reset the watch multiple times till I ensured it was pairing properly.\n\nAnd immediately I got 1day+12 hours battery life. That's the same amount as promised by samsung with everything on.\n\nAll you have to do is just check if only bluetooth is enabled on the watch menu while your phone is near.\n\nDo some hard resets, clear cache - as many times as needed to ensure only bluetooth icon is visible when phone is near. The wifi and LTE symbols should be off if you're normally wearing your watch. Update your settings to auto. This will get you 1.5 days of battery life with AOD off. If you need more than 36 hours of battery life, then do the things others did - turn off AOD, switch off Gemini, set heart rate to measure every 10 mins etc. that's gonna get u that 2 day battery life.\n\n I still don't know why or what's causing it. Maybe my phone has too many bluetooth devices connected to it. Maybe my watch hates my phone in secret. Who knows. But this should fix it.\n\ntldr; read last 3 paragraphs. Good luck.\n\nPS : not a native English speaker. Sorry for the language.\n\n",

If you are having an issue when your Galaxy watch goes into a sleep mode where the always on display and raise to wake are being turned off and not turned back on when you wake up, this is for you. Go into your modes and routines and just toggle those settings off in the sleep mode. I know that this is not ideal if you want it to turn on and off automatically however I don't think that having these things on while sleeping really affects wearing the watch much. ",

    "selftext": "I have to say, despite how much I love my own personal Galaxy Watch 7 44mm + Galaxy Ring combo, I think that the Fit 3 deserves some tremendous respect for getting so many things right.\n\nI've set three different people up with a Fit 3 so far, with great success.  \n\n\\-It's cheap.  Not everyone is into spending hundreds on a Smartwatch or Ring.\n\n\\-It has great battery life.  I'm fine with the shorter battery life of my Watch 7, but I know that none of these people I set up with a Fit 3 would put up with having to charge their watch every 1-2 days.\n\n\\-It's not bulky.  I don't consider my Watch 7 bulky either, certainly not compared to something like a Watch Ultra, but the Fit 3 is a truly lightweight device.\n\n\\-Has all the basic smartwatch features covered.  I'm amazed how well it integrates with Google Messages when receiving texts.  It's great that it still shows you when you are getting a call (even though you can't answer them).  It handles all the core health tracking.  Built-in find-your-phone feature, fall alerts, etc.\n\n\\-Low maintenance.  No apps that need to update constantly.  The Fit 3 itself turns on and off very quick.  This also makes it a great backup watch.  My old Watch 4 Classic on the other-hand, I have to turn it on periodically just to keep the apps updated and it takes a while, uses maybe 10% of the battery just finishing the boot-up process.\n\n  \nNow obviously each watch has it's own pros and cons, but the Fit 3 does a really great job at not just being a cheap watch, but actually doing certain things better than the more expensive watches and creating a great option to bring a big group of people into the Samsung smartwatch / Samsung health ecosystem.",

Ongoing tasks will appear in the Now bar at the bottom of your watch face so you can check key information quickly.\n\nDo more with double pinch  \nJust pinch your thumb and index finger together twice to scroll through notifications, control music, take pictures, and more. You can also customize what happens when you double pinch on the watch face, music controller, as well as alarm, calendar, and reminder alerts. Choose the actions you need most in each situation.\n\nMark reminders as important  \nMark reminders as important by tapping the Star icon. You can choose to have important reminders pinned to the top of the list to make sure you notice them.\n\nNew charging effects  \nWhen your watch is charging, the new screen layout and animations make it easier to check the current battery level and remaining charging time.\n\n**Stay connected**\n\nEasily respond to notifications and alerts  \nUse gestures to quickly respond to notifications and alerts. When a notification appears, you can double pinch to view the details or send a reply. You can also shake your wrist to return to the watch face.\n\nEnhanced notification view  \nNotifications on your watch are now easier to use with an attractive new design. Notifications from the same app are stacked vertically, allowing you to view more notifications with fewer swipes.\n\nSmarter notification settings  \nIt's now easier to decide how to receive notifications from your phone on your watch. If you choose Smart device selection, notifications will appear on your phone only when you're using it and on your watch when you're not using your phone. If you choose Always show on both, notifications will always appear on both your phone and watch.\n\n**Upgrade your health**\n\nRunning coach  \nWhether you're a beginner or an experienced runner, the new Running coach feature in Samsung Health provides personalized training programs and tips to help you run farther and faster while minimizing the risk of injury.\n\nBedtime guidance  \nGet to sleep at the right time so you wake up feeling refreshed. The new Bedtime guidance feature analyzes your sleep data and recommends the best time to go to sleep each night.\n\nMindfulness  \nManage stress and anxiety in your daily life with the new Mindfulness feature in Samsung Health. You can keep track of your moods and emotions and practice breathing exercises to reduce stress.\n\n**Tailored to you**\n\nFind the perfect watch face  \nIt's now easier to find the watch face that's right for you. Just choose a few keywords such as your preferred style, color, and information to show. The best matches will be suggested from our collection of more than 300 watch faces.\n\nRecommended watch faces  \nDiscover new watch faces that you might like. Watch faces with colors, style, or information similar to your current watch face will be recommended on the watch face selection screen.\n\nCreate your own tiles  \nCreate your own custom tiles that show the information you need. You can even combine information from different apps into a single tile. You can include weather information, calendar events, reminders, and more.\n\nPersonalized Apps screen  \nFeatured apps now appear at the top of your Apps screen to give you quick access to the apps you need the most. Apps will be featured based on how often you use them and other usage patterns. You can also view your apps as a list with names instead of only icons.\n\nChoose calendars to show on your watch  \nYou can now choose which calendars to show in the Calendar app on your watch. You can show all of the same calendars that are on your phone or customize to show only the calendars you need.\n\n  \n**Sadly there are no any:**\n\n  \nTrack your vascular load  \nUse your Galaxy Watch to measure your vascular load, which is the amount of stress on your blood vessels. First, take a baseline measurement, then you'll be able to see when your vascular load gets higher or lower over time.  \n  \nCheck your antioxidant intake  \nThe Antioxidant index (Labs) feature on your watch detects the level of carotenoids in your skin. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant contained in fruits and vegetables that can help prevent physical aging.\n\nP.S. It's not bad update overall, but most important features as always Samsung hold just for Ultra models.",

When I open the app, I tap sign in, and then a loading circle starts spinning and I am taken to the browser to log in. There I enter my credentials, complete 2FA and I get a screen saying:\n\nContinue with ********@*****.com\n\nApplicable service: Samsung Health\n\nContinue\n\nCancel\n\nI tap continue, and I am momentarily taken back to the Samsung Health app, I see a glimpse of something loading, and then I am taken back to the browser to the same \"Continue with ... \" screen, and then none of the two options to continue or to cancel work (I mean I tap them and they do nothing). If I go back to Samsung Health, the loading circle spins indefinitely and I actually have to close the app and I need to close it then open it up again, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nWhile I am still able to use my watch through the Galaxy Wearable app, this issue is severely impacting my experience, as I am basically blocked from using basic health features.\n\nI've tried all the usual troubleshooting steps: Clearing cache and data of Samsung Health, reinstalling Samsung Health, downloading, using a different browser (Samsung Internet instead of Google Chrome), restarting the phone. I am using a Redmi Note 12 running HyperOS 2.\n\nIf someone has any idea how to fix that, any help would be much appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "I have to say, despite how much I love my own personal Galaxy Watch 7 44mm + Galaxy Ring combo, I think that the Fit 3 deserves some tremendous respect for getting so many things right.\n\nI've set three different people up with a Fit 3 so far, with great success.  \n\n\\-It's cheap.  Not everyone is into spending hundreds on a Smartwatch or Ring.\n\n\\-It has great battery life.  I'm fine with the shorter battery life of my Watch 7, but I know that none of these people I set up with a Fit 3 would put up with having to charge their watch every 1-2 days.\n\n\\-It's not bulky.  I don't consider my Watch 7 bulky either, certainly not compared to something like a Watch Ultra, but the Fit 3 is a truly lightweight device.\n\n\\-Has all the basic smartwatch features covered.  I'm amazed how well it integrates with Google Messages when receiving texts.  It's great that it still shows you when you are getting a call (even though you can't answer them).  It handles all the core health tracking.  Built-in find-your-phone feature, fall alerts, etc.\n\n\\-Low maintenance.  No apps that need to update constantly.  The Fit 3 itself turns on and off very quick.  This also makes it a great backup watch.  My old Watch 4 Classic on the other-hand, I have to turn it on periodically just to keep the apps updated and it takes a while, uses maybe 10% of the battery just finishing the boot-up process.\n\n  \nNow obviously each watch has it's own pros and cons, but the Fit 3 does a really great job at not just being a cheap watch, but actually doing certain things better than the more expensive watches and creating a great option to bring a big group of people into the Samsung smartwatch / Samsung health ecosystem.",

Apps will be featured based on how often you use them and other usage patterns. You can also view your apps as a list with names instead of only icons.\n\nChoose calendars to show on your watch  \nYou can now choose which calendars to show in the Calendar app on your watch.

First, take a baseline measurement, then you'll be able to see when your vascular load gets higher or lower over time.  \n  \nCheck your antioxidant intake  \nThe Antioxidant index (Labs) feature on your watch detects the level of carotenoids in your skin. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant contained in fruits and vegetables that can help prevent physical aging.\n\nP.S.

    "selftext": "I have an HP Pavilion 15-ec0013dx. Last week, I started getting an 90b cooling fan error every time I turned the laptop on. When I hit enter to continue with startup process, it would load for like 10 minutes before my screen went blue with another error message saying that startup couldn't be completed. I scoured the internet looking for advice on how to fix it. I tried just about everything. Hard reset wasn't helpful. The fan was not dirty or broken and was properly connected. It still ran fine when the laptop was turned on, but I replaced it anyway. It started working again for like 2 days, but then the cooling fan error came back. I replaced the thermal paste. There was no BIOS update available for my model, and my computer wouldn't allow me to reset the BIOS to it's default settings. I'm not very technologically inclined, so maybe I was doing that part wrong, idk. I ran every test through my laptop's built-in Hardware Diagnostics, and everything passed accept for the cooling system test, which passed on fan speed, but failed on temperature. So I just decided to try again in a few days and I put everything away away. Well, it's been 3 days since I last attempted to fix my problem, so I decided to give it another go. But when I plugged in my laptop, the charging indicator light didn't come on, and it would not power on. I am so confused. The last time I ran tests, everything was functioning properly except for the fan. It said the battery was in great condition, and being as it was just replaced a little over a year ago, it definitely should be. The charging port isn't dirty, and there's no way for it to have gotten damaged while it was put away. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the charger that I can tell, and it was working fine just a few days ago. I'm at a loss. Any tips? Or should I just give up and accept that I'll be buying a new laptop this tax season? ",

I could a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for exactly €1500. At this price, it feels like a good deal especially because I did some comparisons and it clears for performance and battery life. Still, I am not entirely sold:\n\n* Windows alternatives (like Zenbook 14 Ultra 9/7, Vivobook S14 AMD AI 9 HX 370, or Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i) have much better memory cuts (32 + 1TB) and the chips seem ok too, but I'm unsure about durability (battery-wise).\n* Portability, as MBP is not the lightest/thinnest, but ig this is just marginal\n* My biggest concern is macOS — I’m worried I’ll find it restrictive compared to Windows, especially for open-source software, and I won't like \"the apple way\"\n\nSo, is the MBP M4 Pro that much better than the competition at this price? This is for windows user converted to mac: how's the jump? do you regret it? is there really something you miss and, on the contrary, that you love about MacOS? Is a mac gonna be as durable as I think (7+ years or something like that)? Considering that I don't have an iphone and probably never will, does it make sense to move to MacOS and is it gonna be traumatic?\n\nMany questions there, sorry, but thank you all :)",

I thought it was because of the power block, but this hasn’t happened in the 8–9 months I’ve had this laptop. This only started happening recently, like about a week ago.\n\nCould it maybe happen if you slap the lid of the laptop too hard or are too rough with it? I have siblings and a mom who aren’t careful with my stuff, and sometimes they take my laptop and aren’t careful with it. I don’t know… does anyone have an answer?",

I was looking at the zenbook s16 and the dell xps 13. What I was wondering is if the 15in display is really crucial, because it is quite a difference in price range, and if I already have a pc at home with a 4070ti and a 13600k, do I really need a top specs laptop when I’m at school.\n\nThanks in advance.",

My audio is reversing in my headphones randomly, the audio would randomly fade out and I’d have to restart the computer, unplugging my microphone causes my laptop to go nuts, my mic randomly turns into the worst sounding thing ever (decribed as an old lady smoker), the monitor keeps turning off, it changes my wallpaper engine background (I usually have a cat with headphones now but it randomly decided to go back to an old wallpaper I used but isn’t even the one I had as my background recently). I mean it’s a d*ll laptop and my ex told me it was really good and I believed him (-$1100 as an 18 y/o 👎). I’m thinking about selling it atp unless anyone has some crazy idea that would fix everything. I mean my bf currently thinks they messed up putting the ribbon back into place but if that’s the case I think I’ll just throw this thing out of my window and let it fall five floors.

    "selftext": "I've been using a Dell Precision M4800 for a few years now and love it but it's getting more and more past its prime. Due to my lack of funds, I'm looking for something used but newer than this, to buy me a few more years of use without breaking the bank.\n\nWhat I particularly like about this one is how beefy it is, it still has space for an optical drive, it has a docking port, and it has not only a 2.5\" hard drive space but a mSATA space (which I use as my boot drive and then have a 4TB SSD in the 2.5\" space for media. Also like that it has a dedicated GPU, but that's gotten too old for Photoshop which is creating problems.\n\nI do Adobe Creative Suite, video editing, and a lot of multimedia stuff with this laptop. It obviously doesn't support Windows 11 without some workaround.\n\nOpen to suggestions.\n\n  \n**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $300-350 USD\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Must be refurb or used due to low budget\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Prioritize performance and expandability\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** My M4800 is huge and heavy so no qualms about size\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** No preference, use external monitors\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Adobe Creative Suite, Vegas Pro, would like to get into Davinci Resolve\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Only games I play are emulated DOS / CD-ROM games\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Prefer optical drive space, space for two drives (2.5\" SSD or mSATA), dedicated GPU, docking port would be nice\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** See post above.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I’m a teenager and my dad asked me if I need a laptop so I was considering requesting one for Christmas. However I’ve only had one laptop when I was like 7 (it broke in a few years and I don’t know what model it was) and I have no idea what to look for. I think my parents can afford expensive laptops but I don’t want them to spend so much money on me so I’d rather something budget friendly. I’m in UK Y10/9th grade in the US I think? So I would be using it for schoolwork but also to watch Netflix and Youtube and maybe play some games - Minecraft and Roblox and I might look into playing PC only games since I’ve only ever played on mobile. Preferably it would last me until university. Can someone please give recommendations🙏",

    "selftext": "So I've been using this laptop since 2019. A couple years ago we started noticing a crack around the screen frame, but patched it up with some reinforcing plastic and heavy duty tape. We weren't entirely sure what caused it, but assumed it was either natural wear or specific accidents at the time. From this first crack, I was advised to only move the screen by holding it from around the hinge (funnily enough, where this new crack is as above). Over time, more cracks started appearing, so a month or so ago we bought another predator second-hand to replace the entire frame in our one. \n\nThe last time I used the laptop was last night for three hours tops, and can confidently say this new crack wasn't there yesterday, else I would have felt it. Besides, I bubble wrap this thing after all the shit its been through, so I'm really confused. \n\nTLDR: Are frame cracks just an unavoidable issue? Has anyone else experienced this? What can I do to avoid it?",

The keyboard lights up, but the screen stays completely black, and the HDMI output also shows nothing.\n​The Failure occurred on: 10/22/2025\n​My Laptop Specifications (Crucial Info):\n​Model: Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 (System Model: 81Y4 / 15IMH05).\n​Processor: Intel Core(TM) i5-10300H (10th Gen).\n​Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (dedicated GPU) and Intel UHD Graphics (integrated GPU).\n​RAM: 16 GB DDR4.\n​The Problem:\n​The failure occurred immediately after running a driver update for the GTX 1650 using the official NVIDIA software (GeForce Experience). After the mandatory reboot, the display never came back on.\n​Diagnostic Steps I ALREADY TOOK (No Success):\n​Hard Reset: Disconnected the power adapter and battery (internal/external), drained residual power (held power button for 60 seconds), and powered on with the charger only.\n​External Display Test: Connected the laptop via HDMI to an external TV/Monitor. There is NO image on the external screen.\n​RAM Module Testing: Opened the chassis and tested each 8 GB RAM stick individually in both slots. Still a black screen.\n​Force Safe Mode: Forced Windows into Automatic Repair (power cycling 3 times). I have no display to select the boot options.\n​Novo Button: Tried accessing the BIOS/Recovery Menu using the dedicated Lenovo Novo Button. The keyboard lights, but the screen remains black.\n​I Need Guidance on USB BIOS Flash (Crisis Recovery):\n​I suspect the BIOS firmware managing GPU initialization is corrupted, and a USB flash is my last resort before professional service.\n​My Specific Questions:\n​Which BIOS file should I download (version name and extension) for my 81Y4/15IMH05 model?\n​What is the exact key combination for my model (e.g., \\text{Fn} + \\text{R} while plugging in power) to initiate the Crisis Recovery?\n​Is there a specific filename that the recovery system must recognize on the FAT32 formatted USB drive (e.g., BIOS.CAP or MAIN.FD)?\n​Is there any additional test related to the internal battery I should perform (e.g., disconnecting it for a longer period) to ensure a complete chipset reset?\n​What other alternative solutions do you think might work?\n​I greatly appreciate all your comments, thanks.",

    "selftext": "Hi, I was thinking of buying a new gaming laptop, which I would use instead of my desktop since I am away from home being an university student. I'm in Italy, and unfortunately the prices are what they are, but I've seen that some brands are offering discounts lately, plus I could take advantage of the unidays student discounts. I'm not looking for something exaggerated, I'd use the laptop more for coding and development, using some game engines, and play some games like overwatch, valorant, cities skylines 2, and some AAA games just sometimes. I know that battery life is a secondary problem in a gaming laptop, but I would like to stay some hours without being plugged in, although I would mainly use it at home, so it's not really a problem. I also use Linux, so it would be great if it had good penguin support.\n\nI saw these two laptops on sale: The HP omen max 16, with the Ryzen (or the Intel ultra 7 255hx, which is about 100 euro cheaper) and the 5070ti for 1,889.99 plus 150 euros of cashback\n\nThe Lenovo legion pro 5i, with the Intel ultra 7 255hx, with the 5070 for 1.687 plus a 15% discount with unidays\n\nThe HP Omen seems to offer a lot, especially the Intel version which would cost 1,650 Euro in the end, but I have read many complaints about the dissipation and the omen cryo compound solution, and not sure about the battery since the CPU is more powerful than the Ryzen AI, but has a higher TDP.\n\nIn the end, I don't mind what brand it is, if you have other suggestions, it's fine if there are any with discounts and unidays.\n\nThank you for the help!",

    "selftext": "Touchpad issue finally fixed\n\nHi everyone, I have an HP Pavilion x360 convertible 14'' since 2022, and since 2024 the touchpad has stopped working. It didn't stop all of a sudden; at first, it was intermittent—it sometimes stopped working at startup and other times worked for 2-3 months before ceasing to work completely. I searched everywhere for a solution and found out that this is a common problem with this PC, and most of the time it seems to be a hardware issue even though some people said it was unfixable because of a  motherboard issue and some said you had to use the welder to fix a small connector. So I contacted a private technician (warranty was expired), and he told me the problem was the cable connecting the touchpad to the motherboard. If I wanted to fix it, he would need to buy a new cable and replace it, all for 400€. I cursed silently in my mind and kindly declined the offer. I started using a mouse, but wow, it’s really annoying! I bought a notebook for a reason! So, I bought the cable myself and replaced it on my own (I have zero experience with these things), spending only 8€, and now it works. For anyone experiencing the same problem, I suggest trying this yourself. If you don’t know where to start opening the case, there are videos on yt﻿ so you can understand how to remove the battery and reach the touchpad cable for replacement.",

    "selftext": "I have an HP Pavilion 15-ec0013dx. Last week, I started getting an 90b cooling fan error every time I turned the laptop on. When I hit enter to continue with startup process, it would load for like 10 minutes before my screen went blue with another error message saying that startup couldn't be completed. I scoured the internet looking for advice on how to fix it. I tried just about everything. Hard reset wasn't helpful. The fan was not dirty or broken and was properly connected. It still ran fine when the laptop was turned on, but I replaced it anyway. It started working again for like 2 days, but then the cooling fan error came back. I replaced the thermal paste. There was no BIOS update available for my model, and my computer wouldn't allow me to reset the BIOS to it's default settings. I'm not very technologically inclined, so maybe I was doing that part wrong, idk. I ran every test through my laptop's built-in Hardware Diagnostics, and everything passed accept for the cooling system test, which passed on fan speed, but failed on temperature. So I just decided to try again in a few days and I put everything away away. Well, it's been 3 days since I last attempted to fix my problem, so I decided to give it another go. But when I plugged in my laptop, the charging indicator light didn't come on, and it would not power on. I am so confused. The last time I ran tests, everything was functioning properly except for the fan. It said the battery was in great condition, and being as it was just replaced a little over a year ago, it definitely should be. The charging port isn't dirty, and there's no way for it to have gotten damaged while it was put away. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the charger that I can tell, and it was working fine just a few days ago. I'm at a loss. Any tips? Or should I just give up and accept that I'll be buying a new laptop this tax season? ",

I could a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for exactly €1500. At this price, it feels like a good deal especially because I did some comparisons and it clears for performance and battery life. Still, I am not entirely sold:\n\n* Windows alternatives (like Zenbook 14 Ultra 9/7, Vivobook S14 AMD AI 9 HX 370, or Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i) have much better memory cuts (32 + 1TB) and the chips seem ok too, but I'm unsure about durability (battery-wise).\n* Portability, as MBP is not the lightest/thinnest, but ig this is just marginal\n* My biggest concern is macOS — I’m worried I’ll find it restrictive compared to Windows, especially for open-source software, and I won't like \"the apple way\"\n\nSo, is the MBP M4 Pro that much better than the competition at this price? This is for windows user converted to mac: how's the jump? do you regret it? is there really something you miss and, on the contrary, that you love about MacOS? Is a mac gonna be as durable as I think (7+ years or something like that)? Considering that I don't have an iphone and probably never will, does it make sense to move to MacOS and is it gonna be traumatic?\n\nMany questions there, sorry, but thank you all :)",

What I was wondering is if the 15in display is really crucial, because it is quite a difference in price range, and if I already have a pc at home with a 4070ti and a 13600k, do I really need a top specs laptop when I’m at school.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I mean it’s a d*ll laptop and my ex told me it was really good and I believed him (-$1100 as an 18 y/o 👎). I’m thinking about selling it atp unless anyone has some crazy idea that would fix everything. I mean my bf currently thinks they messed up putting the ribbon back into place but if that’s the case I think I’ll just throw this thing out of my window and let it fall five floors. All I know is that I hate dell and whoever worked on this laptop (also mind you it took the repair shop seven weeks to “fix” my laptop)",

I'm in Italy, and unfortunately the prices are what they are, but I've seen that some brands are offering discounts lately, plus I could take advantage of the unidays student discounts. I'm not looking for something exaggerated, I'd use the laptop more for coding and development, using some game engines, and play some games like overwatch, valorant, cities skylines 2, and some AAA games just sometimes. I know that battery life is a secondary problem in a gaming laptop, but I would like to stay some hours without being plugged in, although I would mainly use it at home, so it's not really a problem. I also use Linux, so it would be great if it had good penguin support.\n\nI saw these two laptops on sale: The HP omen max 16, with the Ryzen (or the Intel ultra 7 255hx, which is about 100 euro cheaper) and the 5070ti for 1,889.99 plus 150 euros of cashback\n\nThe Lenovo legion pro 5i, with the Intel ultra 7 255hx, with the 5070 for 1.687 plus a 15% discount with unidays\n\nThe HP Omen seems to offer a lot, especially the Intel version which would cost 1,650 Euro in the end, but I have read many complaints about the dissipation and the omen cryo compound solution, and not sure about the battery since the CPU is more powerful than the Ryzen AI, but has a higher TDP.\n\nIn the end, I don't mind what brand it is, if you have other suggestions, it's fine if there are any with discounts and unidays.\n\nThank you for the help!",

    "selftext": "So I've been using this laptop since 2019. A couple years ago we started noticing a crack around the screen frame, but patched it up with some reinforcing plastic and heavy duty tape. We weren't entirely sure what caused it, but assumed it was either natural wear or specific accidents at the time. From this first crack, I was advised to only move the screen by holding it from around the hinge (funnily enough, where this new crack is as above). Over time, more cracks started appearing, so a month or so ago we bought another predator second-hand to replace the entire frame in our one. \n\nThe last time I used the laptop was last night for three hours tops, and can confidently say this new crack wasn't there yesterday, else I would have felt it. Besides, I bubble wrap this thing after all the shit its been through, so I'm really confused. \n\nTLDR: Are frame cracks just an unavoidable issue? Has anyone else experienced this? What can I do to avoid it?",

Due to my lack of funds, I'm looking for something used but newer than this, to buy me a few more years of use without breaking the bank.\n\nWhat I particularly like about this one is how beefy it is, it still has space for an optical drive, it has a docking port, and it has not only a 2.5\" hard drive space but a mSATA space (which I use as my boot drive and then have a 4TB SSD in the 2.5\" space for media. Also like that it has a dedicated GPU, but that's gotten too old for Photoshop which is creating problems.\n\nI do Adobe Creative Suite, video editing, and a lot of multimedia stuff with this laptop. It obviously doesn't support Windows 11 without some workaround.\n\nOpen to suggestions.\n\n  \n**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $300-350 USD\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Must be refurb or used due to low budget\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Prioritize performance and expandability\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** My M4800 is huge and heavy so no qualms about size\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** No preference, use external monitors\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Adobe Creative Suite, Vegas Pro, would like to get into Davinci Resolve\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Only games I play are emulated DOS / CD-ROM games\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Prefer optical drive space, space for two drives (2.5\" SSD or mSATA), dedicated GPU, docking port would be nice\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** See post above.\n\n",

When I hit enter to continue with startup process, it would load for like 10 minutes before my screen went blue with another error message saying that startup couldn't be completed. I scoured the internet looking for advice on how to fix it. I tried just about everything. Hard reset wasn't helpful. The fan was not dirty or broken and was properly connected. It still ran fine when the laptop was turned on, but I replaced it anyway. It started working again for like 2 days, but then the cooling fan error came back. I replaced the thermal paste. There was no BIOS update available for my model, and my computer wouldn't allow me to reset the BIOS to it's default settings. I'm not very technologically inclined, so maybe I was doing that part wrong, idk. I ran every test through my laptop's built-in Hardware Diagnostics, and everything passed accept for the cooling system test, which passed on fan speed, but failed on temperature. So I just decided to try again in a few days and I put everything away away. Well, it's been 3 days since I last attempted to fix my problem, so I decided to give it another go. But when I plugged in my laptop, the charging indicator light didn't come on, and it would not power on. I am so confused. The last time I ran tests, everything was functioning properly except for the fan. It said the battery was in great condition, and being as it was just replaced a little over a year ago, it definitely should be. The charging port isn't dirty, and there's no way for it to have gotten damaged while it was put away. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the charger that I can tell, and it was working fine just a few days ago. I'm at a loss. Any tips? Or should I just give up and accept that I'll be buying a new laptop this tax season? ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’m looking for a new laptop (budget up to €1500) mainly for studying, multimedia, and occasional VCV Rack/TouchDesigner use.\n\nI've been overwhelmingly recommended a mac and basically everybody in the department has it. I could a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for exactly €1500. At this price, it feels like a good deal especially because I did some comparisons and it clears for performance and battery life. Still, I am not entirely sold:\n\n* Windows alternatives (like Zenbook 14 Ultra 9/7, Vivobook S14 AMD AI 9 HX 370, or Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i) have much better memory cuts (32 + 1TB) and the chips seem ok too, but I'm unsure about durability (battery-wise).\n* Portability, as MBP is not the lightest/thinnest, but ig this is just marginal\n* My biggest concern is macOS — I’m worried I’ll find it restrictive compared to Windows, especially for open-source software, and I won't like \"the apple way\"\n\nSo, is the MBP M4 Pro that much better than the competition at this price? This is for windows user converted to mac: how's the jump? do you regret it? is there really something you miss and, on the contrary, that you love about MacOS? Is a mac gonna be as durable as I think (7+ years or something like that)? Considering that I don't have an iphone and probably never will, does it make sense to move to MacOS and is it gonna be traumatic?\n\nMany questions there, sorry, but thank you all :)",

    "selftext": "So this also happened 2 days ago. I was playing, and then suddenly my laptop became slow. I looked at the battery icon, and it wasn’t charging. Could it be because the power block is too hot? What happened last time was that it didn’t turn on at all—I had to plug it in and out 3 times before it started. Then it gave me a blue screen, went off again, and when I turned it on, it was normal again. I thought it was because of the power block, but this hasn’t happened in the 8–9 months I’ve had this laptop. This only started happening recently, like about a week ago.\n\nCould it maybe happen if you slap the lid of the laptop too hard or are too rough with it? I have siblings and a mom who aren’t careful with my stuff, and sometimes they take my laptop and aren’t careful with it. I don’t know… does anyone have an answer?",

The cupboard in question is about 5ft wide, 3-4ft deep, and then whatever standard uk ceiling height is, the door does have a gap at the bottom now i understand that wont be enough so my plan was going to be widen the already existing hole in the roof of the cupboard where my ethernet comes down and place a 120 or 140 mm fan.

My monitors are two titan army 27 inch 2k monitors FWIW because I think the ports needed are different.\n\nI am not tech literate so is it time for a full upgrade?\n\nIf so I have around $800-1000 budget for the parts (already have monitors, mouse, keyboard, etc.)\n\nI mostly play OldSchool RuneScape which isn't too demanding but occasionally play CS, do a little bit of gfx design stuff and consistently have 10+ tabs open. Mostly I just want a decent computer for OSRS, browsing with like 10 tabs open consistently, with good multi tasking for watching streams/movies, etc. I would prefer some longevity over super high level performance since I don't play super demanding games or anything. \n\nAny advice or general direction would be greatly appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Just wanted to share something wild that came out of experimenting with AI-assisted GPU tuning.\nI took a base model RTX 5080 (not a factory OC, not liquid cooled, just the standard retail card), and let an AI help map out a custom voltage-frequency curve with efficiency as the priority — not raw wattage burn.\n\nThe final profile got nicknamed:\n\n“Why Does Yours Sound Like a Jet?”\nBecause it outperforms the $1500 flagship OC cards…\nwhile staying nearly silent and running in the low 50°C range under max load.\n\nKey results (1440p max settings, DLSS Quality + Frame Gen):\n\t•\tFPS: Better than Master/Aorus/Suprim OC editions in most benchmarks\n\t•\tTemps: ~50–55°C (air cooled)\n\t•\tPower draw: Significantly lower than stock (efficiency gain > performance gain)\n\t•\tNoise: Practically inaudible under load\n\nImportant note:\n\nI’m not sharing exact voltage-frequency coordinates. Every 5080 chip has unique silicon characteristics, so copying numbers is pointless. The achievement is in the method, not the mV.\n\nThe AI-Tuned Method (concept only):\n\t•\tTarget the silicon’s natural stable plateau (where it holds boost clocks without extra volts)\n\t•\tLock to that voltage\n\t•\tTrim unnecessary power overhead\n\t•\tAdd memory OC only after core is fully stable\n\t•\tCap FPS to monitor refresh for flat frametimes and zero dips\n\t•\tUse smarter fan curve (not max RPM brute force)\n\nThis tuning flipped the script on “higher watts = higher performance.” With AI guidance, efficiency became the performance multiplier.\n\nWhy post this?\n\nBecause for years enthusiasts have been overvolting GPUs chasing clocks…\nTurns out, with the right curve, undervolting + AI = silent flagship slayer.\n\nIf anyone wants the concept workflow, I can share more. If you’re looking for exact numbers, you’ll need to map your own chip’s curve — that’s the whole point.\n\nProfile name remains legendary:\n\n“Why Does Yours Sound Like a Jet?”\n\nAttached badge for culture.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello, i need advise about a build i recently sold to a friend. Yesterday i finished the build and handled it to him, an hour later he told me he was getting a  wild stuttering in the two games he was testing on (Cod Warzone and Helldivers 2), i was watching while he played Warzone with stable 120fps and around 3 minutes after the fps went horribly down to a minimum of 9fps, not for 0.1 or 0.5 seconds, but for 2-3 full seconds. This is a build i got from leftovers of my own PC and some other parts i bought in order to complete it, the used parts i know for sure they work, it’s been 2 or less months since i stopped to use them because of an upgrade.\n(The stutter only happens in games)\n\nThings i’ve tried so far:\n\n3DMark Stell nomad test - 4,900ish score without stutter\n\nFresh windows 11 install\n\nDecreasing the GPU power limit to 80% in MSI afterburner\n\nWiping the Nvidia Drivers with DDU and reinstalling them, same thing but with 3 versions old Driver\n\nTurning off and on Resize bar\n\nThis was a few hours before having to go to work, so i’m asking for advise to do once i get to it again.\n\nSpecs:\n\nIntel Core i9 11900k - Brand new\n\nBiostar Z490 GTA EVO - Open box, no previous signs of use in this one.\n \n16GB x2 Kingston fury DDR4 3,200mhz - used from my personal PC\n\nKingston NV2 1TB M.2 x2 brand new\n\nZotac RTX 3080ti - used from my own PC\n\nNZXT C850 80+ Gold PSU - brand new\n\n(Couldn’t see the CPU temps. GPU temps were around 40-60c between HD2 and Warzone, both in high settings)\n\nThanks in advance \n\nAh, forgot to mention something curious and probably alarming, the moment the stuttering occurs, a voltaje regulator he has in his room “clicks”\n(PC is not connected to it, is connected directly to the wall)",

    "selftext": "I plan to upgrade my GPU and have been doing research and I figure the best, safest and most cost effective way is to get one second-hand off of FB Marketplace. Only thing is during my research a common thing that would be mentioned is that if I find one I like and can meet them in person, insist on testing it out before making the final purchase. Okay so, how would I go about that?\n\nHypothetically speaking if I found a card I like and the price is reasonable and I message the seller and tell them \" hey, I'd like to buy the card but I wanna test it first to see if it works!\" and they agree, what do I do? Do I take my PC with me to benchmark it (seems dangerous and a bit much to do but if I need to then...), do I trust them to do the testing while I watch, or is there some way to do this that I can't/am not thinking of?\n\n*Update*: Thanks for the quick responses: all of this was helpful and makes perfect sense. I'm sure it's obvious but I've never even used FB Marketplace before, much less for sourcing my PC parts so knowing how to go about it safely is a big help. Thanks a million, you guys are awesome! 😎",

Would I save more money by ordering now or will I be alright in waiting?\n\nThank you - any help would be appreciated!\n\n\\[PCPartPicker Part List\\]([https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/GTgk2x](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/GTgk2x))\n\nType|Item|Price\n\n:----|:----|:----\n\n\\*\\*CPU\\*\\* | \\[AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 4.7 GHz 8-Core Processor\\]([https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/fPyH99/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-47-ghz-8-core-processor-100-1000001084wof](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/fPyH99/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-47-ghz-8-core-processor-100-1000001084wof)) | £419.98 @ [Scan.co.uk](http://Scan.co.uk)\n\n\\*\\*CPU Cooler\\*\\* | \\[be quiet!

    "selftext": "Hello! I'll be brief as this isn't an essential, more a curiosity. \n\nI've just finished building a budget gaming pc made from second hand parts either gifted or from ebay. The only brand new item I bought was a new case with 6 led rgb fans. The power for the fans runs straight from molex clips from the psu and from the front panel there is this ledsw connector (I was going to share a picture, it fits a 2-pin header) to be used to power and control the rgb lights. The motherboard is a gigabyte ga-a320m-s2h v2 and doesn't have an ledsw header. The only headers free on the mobo in fact are the SPDIF, the sys fan, one of the USB, and the NC line in the front panel header. \n\nIs there any hardware or external kit out there that can be used to attach the ledsw to, and then maybe line into a USB port or something so I can use it? Again, not essential as the rgb lights were not a purchase consideration, just a minor added bonus and would probably impress my gen alpha neices or such 😂\n\nThank you for any input 😊",

    "title": "My PC came back from the dead. HELP.",
    "selftext": "Alright everybody, around 8 months ago I built my very first PC. I had my power supply purchased and in a safe, dark, dry place so it wouldn't break down since 2023. \n\nThe other night, I tried to turn my PC on to no avail. Specifically, I would turn it on, get a flash of light smaller than usual, and when I pressed the power button the fans would light up and spin for a sec before giving out. The IMPORTANT part from this however, is that one I did this and got my fans to light up, they wouldn't light up under any circumstance until I left it for a while. Jump starting didn't work either.\n\nSo I sort out all my warranty shit for my PSU, which many, many people all told me it would be. In fact, I was ready to ship it in a day or two. So I bring it down off my shelf, and realise the box I have isn't big enough. While it sits on my desk, I think to myself, why not plug it in again, for shits and giggles? So I do. and it ***turns the fuck on.*** My PSU is making coil whine, and I noticed that the fans took a LITTLE longer than usual to start, but right now, it is running fine with no problems. \n\nSo right now, I am very confused, I have no idea what this could be, so I take to reddit and find a post from a few years ago in a fascinatingly similar situation, and someone points out it may be that the motherboard needed to drain power during a CMOS reset, which in all honesty I'm not even sure what that is. In short they say that it likely took a few days for the motherboard to drain, and that it was likely caused by some underlying issue and that it would likely happen again.\n\nMy question for you all is this, is that what I am experiencing? And if so, is my PSU the root cause and I should send it in for RMA to Corsair? Admittedly, a game me and my friend wanted to play updated today and, providing it doesn't pose significant risk to my machine, I would like to now that I am given the chance. However I should ask you all first if it would be safe to do so. Any input is greatly appreciated, as I am STUMPED.",

    "title": "Upgrading my PC for Ultrawide gaming/Sim Racing, ~$2000 USD",
    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI am currently looking to upgrade from my current PC that I built in late 2019 and would like feedback/recommendations on my part list before I start buying things this weekend. I've been out of the loop for a while so not up to date on what's going on with PC parts these days. My current PC runs well still for my sim racing but I've noticed with more recent games like Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders that my PCs performance isn't what it used to be and I'm feeling the need to upgrade creep in, especially with games like GTA 6 in the near future that I will want to enjoy as well on top of the others mentioned.  \n  \nI use a 38\" 1440p 144hz monitor for both my gaming and sim racing, I have a swivel mount that I move the monitor back and forth between my desk chair and racing setup, I plan on using this monitor for the foreseeable future but I may want to invest in a OLED version of my monitor, or get a bigger ultrawide for my sim racing like a G9 or something so I could potentially have two ultrawide monitors running at once in the future. I don't care about overclocking, I don't care about RGB, I don't care about min/maxing my price:performance ratio, I don't care about aesthetics, I just want to build a PC I can essentially build and forget it for the next 4-5 years or so and something that is relatively quiet and doesn't sound like a jet engine when gaming.   \n  \nI plan on replacing the stock fans in my case with aftermarket fans like Noctuas or T30s but didn't add then to the list. I also plan on using the 1TB drive for a boot drive/program storage and the 2TB for my games/downloads.

    "selftext": "So pretty much all the info online is pointing me towards amd because they are superior in price to performance. My Dad who’s helping me with the build is suggesting I go with Intel tho because apparently amd cpu’s tend to run hotter reducing their longevity in comparison and driving up power usage and cooling requirements therefore also noice. But he also asked me to look into it myself since he doesn’t work with gaming pc’s.\n\nI found one video about amd 7000 series defaulting to 95C but that being normal/optimised. Other than that I didn’t find a lot of information on the topic. So here I am asking for advice.\n\n1. Is the temperature and longevity really a problem with amd?\n2. If so what scale are we talking, because I probably won’t upgrade my cpu for another 3-5 years or so at least. But if it doesn’t drive up power consumption like crazy and I only need to get an extra cooler fan or two I don’t mind. \n\nLast note, I am considering buying a used cpu if that factors in. As for the model I’m really not sure yet but it definitely won’t be anything high end. I am tempted by the AM 5 ones because of future proofing but I’m not planning on upgrading soon anyway and if I get good enough performance for a good price with an AM 4 model I might as well go for that",

    "selftext": "Needless to say I won’t be buying a pre-built again. That said I did RMA my graphics card which seemed to be a source of a lot of my blue screens and poor game performance. The new card certainly does work better but still having issues so looks like I’m not out of the woods yet. I get stutters in some games and texture pop in to some extent though it’s no where near as bad as was with my old card. I’m am getting driver timeouts with some games though mostly with Metal Eden right now but I also know that there was a bad windows update recently so I’m wondering if it’s just a side effect of that? In any case is there any programs I can use to check if the CPU, GPU, or PSU are throwing any weird numbers while I’m playing so I can narrow down the source of the problem? I know I can use OCCT to check the stability of CPU and GPU is that worth running in this scenario? The only thing other than that I can think of to test is the Mobo and PSU cause I am pretty sure the RAM is good I’ve tested it multiple times multiple ways over the course of trouble shooting and it’s never thrown any errors. Any advice for testing the Mobo and PSU? GPU is 7900 XTX CPU is a Ryzen 7950X3D. I have plenty of Ram 64 gb DDR 5 at 5600 MT/s and the SSD is an M.2 so it shouldn’t be bottle necking anything either.

It showed there's a connection, but when I clicked next 'no connection try again', and that was basically a loop.\n\nBypassed the online setup through cmd, Windows did it's updates, all good. Couldn't connect my account though, it said no connection, how weird.\n\nGoogle works, a few websites work, most won't.\n\nI installed new LAN drivers from MSIs support page, didn't change a thing. Latest (non beta) BIOS version, didn't change a thing. Got drivers from RealTek themselves, no results.\n\nNow ChatGPT had me hunting for some stuff which made me realize, that I do have an ipv6 connection, but not an ipv4 one.\n\nI've followed through all of it's suggestions which included a lot of commands in cmd forcing new connections, clearing DNS cache and stuff like this but nothing is changing.\n\nWiFi does exactly the same thing, everything else in the network connects fine. \n\nPC obviously restarted dozens of times, Router restarted a few times, I have no clue what to do anymore.\n\nI very much hope this speaks to someone who has had similar issues or knows his network stuff, cause I'm very frustrated at this point, so if anyone has ANY idea please chip in.\n\nHappy to give further info if that helps of course.",

Was just wondering on whether the parts selected were fine?\n\nI know AM4 is older but I'm not really planning to upgrade and my use case isn't that heavy (been on 960m + 1650 laptop over the last decade and have just tweaked to dogshit settings to run games and hit 45 fps). I'm fine with just running on low-medium settings but would appreciate at least stable 60 fps in most games. In any case, I don't think I'm planning to upgrade for 5 years, so hopefully it will be fine and I hope the CPU isn't too much of a bottleneck.\n\nThere's definitely cheaper parts in the budget such as getting a cheaper case and PSU, but I don't mind paying a bit more for those parts (since I like the look of the case and the PSU is A-tier (though I'm not too sure on how necessary it is)).\n\nLooking for a 24\" 1080p monitor as well within $250 if possible. I'm upgrading from a laptop so it'll be a big upgrade and I'm not too sure if jumping into 27\" 1440p is \"better\" (but if it's cheaper and has better specs I may consider it).\n\n\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/vNxnPJ)\n\n|Type|Item|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 5 5600 3.5 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/PgcG3C/amd-ryzen-5-5600-36-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100000927box)|$148.77 @ JW Computers|\n|**Motherboard**|[MSI B550M PRO-VDH WIFI Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/PDsnTW/msi-b550m-pro-vdh-wifi-micro-atx-am4-motherboard-b550m-pro-vdh-wifi)|$147.77 @ JW Computers|\n|**Memory**|[Corsair Vengeance LPX 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3600 CL18 Memory](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/VhmFf7/corsair-vengeance-lpx-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-cmk32gx4m2z3600c18)|$115.55 @ Amazon Australia|\n|**Storage**|[Crucial P3 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 3.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/sw4Ycf/crucial-p3-1-tb-m2-2280-nvme-solid-state-drive-ct1000p3ssd8)|$99.00 @ Computer Alliance|\n|**Video Card**|[PowerColor Reaper Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB Video Card](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/fzh2FT/powercolor-reaper-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16-gb-video-card-rx9060xt-16g-a)|$569.00 @ Centre Com|\n|**Case**|[Lian Li A3-mATX MicroATX Mini Tower Case](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/FG7scf/lian-li-a3-matx-microatx-mini-tower-case-a3-matx-wd-black)|$130.00 @ BPC Technology|\n|**Power Supply**|[ADATA XPG Core Reactor II VE 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/dLTZxr/adata-xpg-core-reactor-ii-ve-750-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-corereactoriive750g-bkcus)|$125.00 @ Scorptec|\n|*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts*|||\n|**Total**|**$1335.09**||\n|Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-10-24 05:06 AEDT+1100|||",

I bought a new 2nd hand TUF 4080 Super and 14900k bundle from a guy locally. Both looked very clean, in fact he said he just had the 4080 warranty swapped and had many 2-3 hours on it just to make sure it runs (visually very clean no dust/scuffs, looked new). \n\nNow to my issues, cpu is running great, but my gpu is running 99% and I'm getting sub 30 fps... doesn't matter what game I play, modern games like cyberpunk are unplayable, even older games like classic WoW are 15-20 fps in a town at 99% gpu util. I've ran 3D Mark and my score was 690 averaging 7fps when the average for my setup was 6574. Also my hdmi out on the gpu is completely unresponsive, I'm using a 42\" oled with 4k/120 display port to hdmi to circumvent since my tv/monitor doesn't have dp in, unsure if its all connected but maybe useful info.\n\nThings I've done to try and remedy this.\n\nReseat gpu  \nFlash bios/update bios  \nDDU  \nMake sure reBar enabled  \nMake sure pcie 4  \nMake sure gpu fans are spinning  \nBasically every forum thread suggestion so far\n\nAny and all suggestions are welcome and I'm not opposed to redoing previous steps.

    "title": "Need the ultimate Davinci Resolve Workstation for 6K Open Gate V-Log Editing!",
    "selftext": "Hey r/buildapc,\n\nI've been lurking here for ages, absorbing all the build guides, parts lists, and epic success/fail stories. Now, after years of making do with a less-than-ideal machine, I'm finally ready to take the plunge and build my first true editing powerhouse. I need your collective expertise!\n\nThis PC is strictly a **workstation**, no gaming required (though I won't complain if it can run *Minesweeper* at 240fps).\n\n**The Primary Goal:** Flawless, real-time editing of **6K Open Gate V-Log (H.265 10-bit 4:2:2 or similar high-bitrate footage)**, primarily in **DaVinci Resolve Studio**. This includes heavy color grading, multiple nodes, noise reduction, and some moderate Fusion effects/motion graphics.\n\n**What I know I need (based on my research):**\n\n* **GPU:** I know I need an NVIDIA card for the CUDA performance and high VRAM. I'm currently eyeing something in the **RTX 5070 Ti / 5080** range.\n* **CPU:** Something with enough cores to handle decoding and general system tasks, but the emphasis is on the GPU. I'm flexible between the latest **Intel i9 (for Quick Sync decoding help)** or **AMD Ryzen 9**.\n* **RAM:** I'm aiming for **128GB DDR5**. For this specific high-bit rate 6K workflow, is 128GB necessary for stability, or could I realistically start with 64GB and still achieve a stutter-free experience?\n* **Storage:** Speed is paramount. I'm planning a multi-drive setup:\n   1. OS/Programs: 1TB fast PCIe 5.0 NVMe\n   2. Media Cache/Scratch: Planning to reuse my existing 4TB Samsung 990 Pro (PCIe 4.0) dedicated entirely as the cache drive.\n   3. Project Media: Separate high-capacity SSDs or a fast NAS (future upgrade).\n\n**The Unknowns / Where I need your advice:**\n\n1. **CPU/GPU**: Based on my research so far, I believe an **NVIDIA GPU** is better for the Resolve workflow due to CUDA and VRAM. Is the general consensus still that the **Intel/NVIDIA** combination provides the most reliable and optimized ecosystem for H.265 V-Log work over an AMD setup?\n2. **Motherboard/PSU:** What reliable MoBo/PSU combo can handle these high-power components and offer future-proof connectivity (especially fast external drives/Thunderbolt)?\n3. **Cooling:** With high-end parts pushing 6K footage, which air or AIO coolers do you recommend for keeping things quiet and stable during long renders?\n\n**Budget:** Flexible, but aiming for the best performance/dollar without going full Threadripper/Quadro overkill. Let's say a rough range of **$3000 - $4000 for the tower alone**.\n\nI'm working on a draft list on [PCPartPicker ](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Tg63Lc)now, but before I commit, any suggested parts lists, component tweaks, or tips for a first-time high-end builder would be massively appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

I also added a +2000 memory clock and unlocked the power limit.\n\nI notice that every now and then i will get a frame spike or stutter. Seeing that people have had success with these settings for this card i figured it would be fine.\n\nQuestion is, is it the core clock or the memory clock that needs to be dialed down to address this. Im assuming the memory is far too clocked and is correcting itself causing a stutter to occur. If it was a core clock that needed to be dialed down, wouldn’t the game crash entirely?\n\nThanks in advance. Also, a +250 core and a +1500mhz mem did just fine, i dont even know if the slight difference between the two overclock settings would even make a difference.",

    "selftext": "Howdy, y'all! I'm finally starting the journey to build my first computer. After the one I had as a kid died, I've been playing on a stupid laptop and it is horrible and I've had enough. I've done some research and and come up with a parts list for a pc that feels within my budget and is decent for the games I wanna play, but I wanted to ask some more experienced builders before I go buying everything. As for games, I typically play World of Warcraft and heavily modded minecraft (I'd love to try terrafirmagreg but my laptop can't handle it -\\_-), and a handful of other games. I don't need super high competitive gameplay specs, but I do want to be able to have good graphics. I'm also trying to keep the cost under $1000\n\n[Here is my list:](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Dqn3Lc)\n\nAs for some notes: I'd love to upgrade to ddr5 ram, but that's such an investment since I'd have to upgrade the motherboard and cpu as well. I'm only getting 1 TB stick right now, but I'll get more if I need more in the future, the motherboard has a second slot. Is it worth it to get the 650w PSU? My build seems to only be needing about 400w right now, but I'm not sure how much headroom I need. Is the GPU too much? I definitely don't wanna skimp on the gpu, as graphics are most important to me, but I wanna make sure its not being bottlenecked by the cpu and I'm not overspending.\n\nThanks for any advice! ",

    "selftext": "Hello :)\n\nI'm considering an upgrade to boost my 1080p 144Hz gaming experience, especially for titles like BF6, CS2, Elden Ring, and RDR2. I also plan to use this build for coding and programming assignments and multitasking/browsing. I’ve been out of the loop on hardware for a while, so I’d love some advice on whether my planned upgrade makes sense given today’s market.\n\nHere's my current setup that I built back in 2019 \\[[PCPartPicker link](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/MRRzLP)\\]:\n\n* **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X\n* **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 2070\n* **Motherboard**: MSI B450 Tomahawk\n* **RAM**: Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3000 CL15 Memory\n* **PSU**: Corsair CX650M 650 W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi-modular ATX Power Supply\n\nI'm eyeing the following used components on eBay:\n\n* Ryzen 7 5700X3D - $265\n* NVIDIA RTX 4070 - $450\n\nThis brings the total to around $725–$750. and I’d likely sell my current CPU (\\~$30) and GPU (\\~$150).\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. **Performance Gains**: Will this combination significantly improve my FPS in the games mentioned above at 1080p 144Hz on high/ultra settings? Is it worth it at these prices, especially with 5700X3D availability starting to shrink?\n2. **Longevity**: Considering the 5700X3D is the last AM4 CPU with 3D V-Cache, how long can I expect this setup to remain competitive? Ideally, I’d like something that can last me until around 2030 (or whenever AM6 drops).\n3. **Component Prioritization**: Given my current setup, would upgrading the GPU or CPU alone provide a noticeable performance boost, or are both upgrades equally important?\n4. **Alternatives**: Should I consider upgrading to AM5 instead? What would be the best CPU and GPU combo within a $750–$850 budget, including motherboard and RAM? I'm aiming for a balance between performance and cost-effectiveness, as well as with future-proofing in mind.\n\nI’m looking for the best value upgrade that improves both gaming and general productivity (browsing, coding, multitasking) while still being reasonably future-proof.\n\nAny advice, personal experiences, or part recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",

    "title": "RX 9070 XT (AMD H264) vs RTX 5070 TI (NVENC H264)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone. As I mentioned in the title, this is about the video encoders from AMD and NVIDIA's latest graphics card generations. I'm currently in a dilemma, trying to decide between the two cards, but I'm not sure about the performance impact I might experience with one or the other when recording or streaming content. In Forza Horizon 5, I drove the exact same route, for 10 minutes, with the same in-game time set (when creating routes) on both cards, the RTX 5070 TI and the RX 9070 XT, once without recording and once with recording. I used MSI Afterburner's built-in benchmark recording tool to get a good benchmark for the AVG fps. However, I get significantly better results with the RX 9070 XT when used with the AMD H264 video encoder than with the NVENC H264 video encoder on the RTX 5070 TI. With the RX 9070 XT, I get an average of 217.8 FPS without recording, while with recording, I get 204.5 FPS. So far, so good. But with an RTX 5070 TI, I get a good average of 198.1 FPS without recording, but with NVENC, a rather miserable 169.4 FPS. One thing I noticed quite quickly is that the RTX 5070 TI has a power consumption of 230W-240W when driving the same route without a recording running, but the power consumption drops to around 195W-210W as soon as I open OBS Studio with a recording running.\n\nI also noticed that I get a lot of dropped frames due to render delay in OBS studio when recording with NVIDIA NVENC encoder on the RTX 5070 TI, which ultimately results in stuttery recordings, whereas with the RX 9070 XT it works perfectly with the AMD encoder without any render delay.\n\nSo, I almost always see a significant drop in performance when I start a recording with the NVENC video encoder in Forza Horizon 5 using either the NVIDIA NVENC H264 encoder or the AMD H264 encoder. In OBS Studio, I record at 1440p60 and use .mp4 as the file format. At this point, I'm not entirely sure how this will act in other games. I also tested Fortnite on Epic, TSR (60% Recommended) at 1440p. I positioned myself in a randomly named location with a lot of graphically demanding elements and went AFK for about two minutes at a time, then recorded comparisons between the two cards inside the replay-mode of this match. The same scenario emerged: The RTX 5070 TI achieved an average FPS of 89.3 FPS without recording, and with a recording, the performance dropped to an average of 78.7 FPS. With the RX 9070 XT, I achieved an average of 108.5 FPS without recording and an average of 105.5 FPS with a recording.\n\nMaybe someone else can share their experiences with NVENC, or offer suggestions for potential solutions or improvements. Perhaps there are settings in the NVIDIA control panel. Because when I bought an RTX 5070 TI, I actually expected to experience very good video encoder performance, since many people always say that current NVIDIA graphics cards are well suited for content creators. But currently I have the feeling that the RX 9070 XT is better suited to my situations, as it doesn't produce jerky recordings under full load with unlimited FPS under FH5 at 1440p, preset extreme.\n\nThe exact models of the graphics cards that I currently have are the following: The ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti OC and the ASUS TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC. And I honestly can't decide which of the two I prefer. On the one hand, the NVIDIA card is significantly more efficient, as in some situations it consumes almost 100W less power than the AMD card. Although the AMD card can be undervolted quite well, which I've already tried. Still, I'm undecided.\n\nSomething I forgot to mention and am adding now while editing: I'm using an R7 7800x3D with 32GB of DDR5 5200MHz and an ASUS Strix B650E-F Gaming WIFI motherboard. It also has an 850W gold-certified power supply from Be Quiet! My operating system is Windows 10 and a very fast NVME SSD from Kingston. Both cards were included in my tests, which I continue to run on the latest driver version.",

    "selftext": "###Troubleshooting Help:\n\n**Parts list:** https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xstVxg\n\n**Describe your problem.**\n\nSo I finally got the last of my remaining parts as shown in my pcparts list for my first AMD rig since 2003 on my Athlon XP 2100+\n\nHowever, after updating the UEFI on the new MSI motherboard to Sept 2025 version and then fighting with not being able to boot to the front USB case ports, turning off secure boot and CSM, I gave up put my Sandisk ultra thumb drive on back ports and was finally able to select it with F11 boot selection. I guess MSI boards don't have boot overrides in the UEFI like Asus motherboards I'm used to where I can just click on the USB drive and it boots to it.\n\nAfter finally getting to Win installation menu and doing older install process as I like to manually delete partions as I have a large data partition on my SN850X that I cannot wipe, I experienced things I've never had before:\n\n* *Wiping the partitions is unusually slow, it took a few seconds. Before on my old 9700k/asus z390 prime setup, deleting them was instant*\n* *Once the windows  began installing, it only went up 2-3% at a time and took over 3 minutes to install for the reboot. My old intel setup would do large percentages and would be done in a little over a minute on the same SN850X. It should absolutely fly mach speed style on this SN850X 4TB in the top M.2 slot on the MPG Ti motherboard. There are no other M.2/sata SSD drives attached*\n* *Once it got the UEFI logo/windows loading screen and setting up devices it say on \"Getting ready\" for over 10 minutes to the point I thought something failed so I powered off, rebooted to USB and tried again and it still took over 10 minutes for it to FINALLY go into windows desktop. I have never in my years of installing Win 11 both personally and professionally seen Win11 install churn so long on \"Getting ready\" screen*\n\n\n**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**\n\n* I have been installing 24H2 Windows Pro ISO the last several years but this year I decided to just go right into 25H2 and not deal with a large windows update. Could 25H2 be broken in some way?\n* I used newest rufus to create the bootable USB from 25H2 ISO from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11\n* In rufus I select to remove 4GB, Secure boot, and TPM 2.0 along with Microsoft account, make a local account, disable data collection and disable automatic bit locker. I've done this for years with no issues on my Intel setup, is AMD more picky or is this 25H2 possibly an and go back to 24H2?\n* I then turned secure boot back on and CSM off in UEFI and attempted to install Windows 11 again, but it was still real slow on installing and still sits on \"Getting Ready\" for a long time.\n* I changed the Memory profile to EXPO1 in UEFI as apparently thats proper for AMD memory vs XMP\n* X3D Game Mode is turned off in UEFI\n* I don't plug in ethernet during my Windows installs as I don't want windows auto installing drivers, I want to manually choose and install my pre downloaded chipset, GPU, soundcard drivers ect... or is that not the way to do it with modern Win11 on these AMD boards?\n* 9800X3D is sitting at 42c at 1.16volts according to UEFI, so its not overheating\n\n**Provide any additional details you wish below.**\n\nAgain, I have not built an AMD based rig since 2003, I've been Intel since then, so I\"m sure a lot has changed and despite me building over a dozen systems since 2001, I'm rather perplexed at why Windows is so very slow at install vs my older intel rig to the point I feel like something is wrong and I don't want to proceed with finishing installing windows until I know I'm doing this right",

    "selftext": "In a previous post I asked about the 9060 xt 8gb and 16gb, with the mayority of people saying the 16gb was more worth it in comparison. That made me want to look into the 350 usd price range and I found that the 6800 xt was around that price and in most scenarios it was around 10 to 15% better.\n\nSo I ask, would you buy a new gpu or would you instead buy a used gpu that costs slightly less (25 to 50 usd less), have 10% to 15% higher performance, but at the cost of nearly twice the power consumption (160 vs 300 watts)?\n\nHow far would you go? How much power consumption for performance is too much? What is the price limit to make the exchange worth it? Or is a new gpu always better than a used one?",

In that configuration the fans at the bottom would be intake and the fans at the top exhaust.

    "selftext": "I plan to upgrade my GPU and have been doing research and I figure the best, safest and most cost effective way is to get one second-hand off of FB Marketplace. Only thing is during my research a common thing that would be mentioned is that if I find one I like and can meet them in person, insist on testing it out before making the final purchase. Okay so, how would I go about that?\n\nHypothetically speaking if I found a card I like and the price is reasonable and I message the seller and tell them \" hey, I'd like to buy the card but I wanna test it first to see if it works!\" and they agree, what do I do? Do I take my PC with me to benchmark it (seems dangerous and a bit much to do but if I need to then...), do I trust them to do the testing while I watch, or is there some way to do this that I can't/am not thinking of?\n\n*Update*: Thanks for the quick responses: all of this was helpful and makes perfect sense. I'm sure it's obvious but I've never even used FB Marketplace before, much less for sourcing my PC parts so knowing how to go about it safely is a big help. Thanks a million, you guys are awesome! 😎",

Mostly I just want a decent computer for OSRS, browsing with like 10 tabs open consistently, with good multi tasking for watching streams/movies, etc. I would prefer some longevity over super high level performance since I don't play super demanding games or anything. \n\nAny advice or general direction would be greatly appreciated.",

    "title": "My PC came back from the dead. HELP.",
    "selftext": "Alright everybody, around 8 months ago I built my very first PC. I had my power supply purchased and in a safe, dark, dry place so it wouldn't break down since 2023. \n\nThe other night, I tried to turn my PC on to no avail. Specifically, I would turn it on, get a flash of light smaller than usual, and when I pressed the power button the fans would light up and spin for a sec before giving out. The IMPORTANT part from this however, is that one I did this and got my fans to light up, they wouldn't light up under any circumstance until I left it for a while. Jump starting didn't work either.\n\nSo I sort out all my warranty shit for my PSU, which many, many people all told me it would be. In fact, I was ready to ship it in a day or two. So I bring it down off my shelf, and realise the box I have isn't big enough. While it sits on my desk, I think to myself, why not plug it in again, for shits and giggles? So I do. and it ***turns the fuck on.*** My PSU is making coil whine, and I noticed that the fans took a LITTLE longer than usual to start, but right now, it is running fine with no problems. \n\nSo right now, I am very confused, I have no idea what this could be, so I take to reddit and find a post from a few years ago in a fascinatingly similar situation, and someone points out it may be that the motherboard needed to drain power during a CMOS reset, which in all honesty I'm not even sure what that is. In short they say that it likely took a few days for the motherboard to drain, and that it was likely caused by some underlying issue and that it would likely happen again.\n\nMy question for you all is this, is that what I am experiencing? And if so, is my PSU the root cause and I should send it in for RMA to Corsair? Admittedly, a game me and my friend wanted to play updated today and, providing it doesn't pose significant risk to my machine, I would like to now that I am given the chance. However I should ask you all first if it would be safe to do so. Any input is greatly appreciated, as I am STUMPED.",

I thought it was just windows doing its thing so I did a clean install, but it kept crashing. I tried reseating the ram and cpu, even the ssd (don't know if it actually does anything) did another clean install, but it keeps crashing. Eventually did a sfc /scannow and it actually found corrupt files so i thought \"I'll just redo the windows usb and reinstall, maybe something went wrong\" but even after redoing it and reinstalling 2 times it still found corrupt files all the times. Im at a loss here, the only dodgy brand on the pc parts is the psu, the rest of the parts are all major brands. But even then I suppose that psu instability wouldn't cause this type of issues.

FYI, this is my first PC, so some of these picks may seem a bit dumb, but I don't have the knowledge nor experience to pick out hidden gems. Sorry, but no I will not be changing the NZXT products.

The only brand new item I bought was a new case with 6 led rgb fans. The power for the fans runs straight from molex clips from the psu and from the front panel there is this ledsw connector (I was going to share a picture, it fits a 2-pin header) to be used to power and control the rgb lights. The motherboard is a gigabyte ga-a320m-s2h v2 and doesn't have an ledsw header. The only headers free on the mobo in fact are the SPDIF, the sys fan, one of the USB, and the NC line in the front panel header. \n\nIs there any hardware or external kit out there that can be used to attach the ledsw to, and then maybe line into a USB port or something so I can use it? Again, not essential as the rgb lights were not a purchase consideration, just a minor added bonus and would probably impress my gen alpha neices or such 😂\n\nThank you for any input 😊",

Okay so, how would I go about that?\n\nHypothetically speaking if I found a card I like and the price is reasonable and I message the seller and tell them \" hey, I'd like to buy the card but I wanna test it first to see if it works!\" and they agree, what do I do? Do I take my PC with me to benchmark it (seems dangerous and a bit much to do but if I need to then...), do I trust them to do the testing while I watch, or is there some way to do this that I can't/am not thinking of?\n\n*Update*: Thanks for the quick responses: all of this was helpful and makes perfect sense. I'm sure it's obvious but I've never even used FB Marketplace before, much less for sourcing my PC parts so knowing how to go about it safely is a big help.

My monitors are two titan army 27 inch 2k monitors FWIW because I think the ports needed are different.\n\nI am not tech literate so is it time for a full upgrade?\n\nIf so I have around $800-1000 budget for the parts (already have monitors, mouse, keyboard, etc.)\n\nI mostly play OldSchool RuneScape which isn't too demanding but occasionally play CS, do a little bit of gfx design stuff and consistently have 10+ tabs open. Mostly I just want a decent computer for OSRS, browsing with like 10 tabs open consistently, with good multi tasking for watching streams/movies, etc. I would prefer some longevity over super high level performance since I don't play super demanding games or anything. \n\nAny advice or general direction would be greatly appreciated.",

    "title": "My PC came back from the dead. HELP.",
    "selftext": "Alright everybody, around 8 months ago I built my very first PC. I had my power supply purchased and in a safe, dark, dry place so it wouldn't break down since 2023. \n\nThe other night, I tried to turn my PC on to no avail. Specifically, I would turn it on, get a flash of light smaller than usual, and when I pressed the power button the fans would light up and spin for a sec before giving out. The IMPORTANT part from this however, is that one I did this and got my fans to light up, they wouldn't light up under any circumstance until I left it for a while. Jump starting didn't work either.\n\nSo I sort out all my warranty shit for my PSU, which many, many people all told me it would be. In fact, I was ready to ship it in a day or two. So I bring it down off my shelf, and realise the box I have isn't big enough. While it sits on my desk, I think to myself, why not plug it in again, for shits and giggles? So I do. and it ***turns the fuck on.*** My PSU is making coil whine, and I noticed that the fans took a LITTLE longer than usual to start, but right now, it is running fine with no problems. \n\nSo right now, I am very confused, I have no idea what this could be, so I take to reddit and find a post from a few years ago in a fascinatingly similar situation, and someone points out it may be that the motherboard needed to drain power during a CMOS reset, which in all honesty I'm not even sure what that is. In short they say that it likely took a few days for the motherboard to drain, and that it was likely caused by some underlying issue and that it would likely happen again.\n\nMy question for you all is this, is that what I am experiencing? And if so, is my PSU the root cause and I should send it in for RMA to Corsair? Admittedly, a game me and my friend wanted to play updated today and, providing it doesn't pose significant risk to my machine, I would like to now that I am given the chance. However I should ask you all first if it would be safe to do so. Any input is greatly appreciated, as I am STUMPED.",

I removed it used a smaller one to hook up only the fans the kraken are on just to get it running again and it won’t start up still.

    "title": "Corrupt files on clean install and crashing,",
    "selftext": "So basically my friend bought a pc like 2 years ago and about a week ago it started crashing and black screening on him after just a couple of minutes of use. I thought it was just windows doing its thing so I did a clean install, but it kept crashing. I tried reseating the ram and cpu, even the ssd (don't know if it actually does anything) did another clean install, but it keeps crashing. Eventually did a sfc /scannow and it actually found corrupt files so i thought \"I'll just redo the windows usb and reinstall, maybe something went wrong\" but even after redoing it and reinstalling 2 times it still found corrupt files all the times. Im at a loss here, the only dodgy brand on the pc parts is the psu, the rest of the parts are all major brands. But even then I suppose that psu instability wouldn't cause this type of issues. I even did passmark memtest and nothing came out wrong.\n\nPart list:\n\nKingston fury ddr4 3200mt/s \n\nasus rx 7600 \n\nryzen 5 5600\n\nwd blue sn570 1tb\n\nasus tuf b520m plus 2\n\nnox uranno vx 650w",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing.

It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics.

The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options.

Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do.

In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds.

The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original.

It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

You can prove me wrong 😀\n\nGameplay consists of simple first person point-and-click mechanics. Where it stands out is interactivity. Environment is carefully hand-crafted with attention to detail, from the architecture of the buildings all the way down to the flushing sounds in the toilet.\n\nThe estimated length of the game is roughly 2 hours i would say. The length of the game depends on how fast you solve the puzzles. Some of them might be slightly on the more difficult side of the spectrum since they are a little bit unconventional.\n\n**Main features**\n\n* **Atmospheric first-person** mystery with light point-and-click style interactions.  \n* **Highly interactive environments** \\- almost everything reacts: drawers, switches, computers, instruments, sauna, etc.  \n* **Environmental storytelling**: newspapers, phones, and tiny props that hide clues.  \n* **Puzzles** that skew a bit **unconventional** \\- some are simple, a few are “huh… wait” moments by design.  \n\nBuilt to reward **curiosity** and **note-taking** rather than brute forcing.",

To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description.

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

It’s pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound’s coming from. I don’t see any technical reason why we can’t have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative.

Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game.

Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape.

Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever.

However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries.

While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads.

It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me.

    "selftext": "To be more specific, Massive Entertainment put out a social media statement implying that they're encouraging staff to voluntarily leave the company/lay themselves off with benefits/company assistance:\n\n\"As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games. To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

    "selftext": "\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hoh56t949twf1.gif\n\nHey, I’m Sulo (SuloSounds) and I’m a solo developer from Finland and my game Remote Position is finally here!\n\nRemote Position is a single player game that offers a deep mysterious story with a lot of secrets\n\nI designed some of the secrets to last a lifetime hopefully. You can prove me wrong 😀\n\nGameplay consists of simple first person point-and-click mechanics. Where it stands out is interactivity. Environment is carefully hand-crafted with attention to detail, from the architecture of the buildings all the way down to the flushing sounds in the toilet.\n\nThe estimated length of the game is roughly 2 hours i would say. The length of the game depends on how fast you solve the puzzles. Some of them might be slightly on the more difficult side of the spectrum since they are a little bit unconventional.\n\n**Main features**\n\n* **Atmospheric first-person** mystery with light point-and-click style interactions.  \n* **Highly interactive environments** \\- almost everything reacts: drawers, switches, computers, instruments, sauna, etc.  \n* **Environmental storytelling**: newspapers, phones, and tiny props that hide clues.  \n* **Puzzles** that skew a bit **unconventional** \\- some are simple, a few are “huh… wait” moments by design.  \n\nBuilt to reward **curiosity** and **note-taking** rather than brute forcing.",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative.

It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience.

Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game.

Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape.

Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever.

However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries.

While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019.

It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me.

It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling with a problem that’s been driving me crazy for quite a while now — and I’m completely out of ideas at this point. Maybe someone here has some insight or experience that could help me figure this out.\n\nHere’s my current setup:\n\t•\tCPU: Ryzen 9 5900XT\n\t•\tGPU: Gigabyte RTX 3060\n\t•\tRAM: 64 GB\n\t•\tMotherboard: ASRock B450 HDV-M\n\t•\tPower Supply: be quiet! Gold+ (more than enough wattage)\n\nOn paper, that should be a pretty solid system. However, I’m getting massive frame drops in nearly every game I play — sometimes down to below 1 FPS. The drops happen irregularly but usually not more than 10 seconds apart.\n\nWhen I monitor the system in MSI Afterburner, the pattern shown in the attached screenshot appears. What really stands out is that the FPS drops always occur exactly when the “Voltage Limit” kicks in. I’m starting to suspect that my motherboard might be limiting performance or not distributing power correctly.\n\nHere’s what I’ve already ruled out:\n\t•\tCPU: previously had a Ryzen 5800X – same problem, so CPU is likely fine\n\t•\tPSU: replaced an older budget unit with a be quiet! Gold+ – no difference\n\t•\tDrivers: all up to date\n\t•\tBIOS: updated and optimized\n\t•\tAfterburner: tried maxing out and resetting power limit / core voltage – no effect\n\t•\tGraphics settings: doesn’t matter if low or ultra; even at 50% GPU load, the stutters occur\n\nAt this point, I’m honestly out of ideas. I’ve tried all the common fixes I could find online, and even AI/chat support couldn’t get me anywhere.\n\nHas anyone here experienced something similar, or does anyone know how to bypass or adjust the voltage limit that might be causing these spikes?\nOr could it be something else entirely — maybe a hidden bottleneck I’m missing?\n\nAny help, ideas, or directions would be hugely appreciated. Right now, every game is basically unplayable because of these frame drops, and I’m really running out of patience.\n\nThanks in advance!\nciaokakao",

    "selftext": "So I have the RX7700XT with 12GB OC, and it’s a great GPU, however I have three monitors and when all of them are being used it drops frames a bit, I don’t wanna go out and spend $800 or whatever on a new GPU so my idea was to simply buy a cheap GPU and use that for all my secondary monitors and keep the 7700 for the main monitor, my motherboard is the X670E-PLUS WIFI and I know it’ll be fine with another GPU. I just need to find one, idc if it’s used as long as it all works fine. Is this a good idea? It shouldn’t stress anything on my pc aside from the PSU right? If anyone knows where I can get something that’ll be decent for that it’d be appreciated, I’d prefer AMD but anything will do. The secondary monitors are mainly used for simultaneous playback, possibly some super light games (like Roblox light). (EDIT): I’m getting another 4K OLED monitor and I wanna be able to use it to it potential which is why I’ve decided to do this now, right now I’m all on 1080P not 4K so the second GPU needs at least three outputs.",

    "selftext": "My friends really aren’t into pc building but I’m proud of this and wanted to share it with people who would understand so I made a Reddit account to post here lol.\n\nI wanted to build a powerful pc that was small form factor but I didn’t wanna break the bank in terms of how much both of those things can cost. (I also had no experience pc building at all) So after lots of research, patience and luck this is what I got:\n\nCase: Nzxt H1 v2 I got this off eBay for $150 and I chose it because of the style, ease of building, and the 750w psu. I was most nervous about the case since it was used and I’d heard mixed reviews about the cooler and psu going bad but it works great!\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte x870i aorus pro ice I actually got pretty lucky here. I wouldn’t have gone for such an expensive board but I got it for $155 on Mac.Bid brand new!\n\nCPU: 7800x3D I got from Jawa for $325. I saw that it would pair well with the gpu and since I got such a good deal on the case and mb I didn’t mind spending this on the cpu. It didn’t come with a box though so it’s not pictured.\n\nGpu: 9070xt Reaper I knew I wanted something strong that would last a while and this one only needs a 750w power supply according to the manufacturer. And the best part is I got it at msrp! Microcenter had it for $599! I had to buy it.\n\nRam: T-create expert 32gb ddr5 cl30 6000mhz Technically free? It was on sale on Newegg for $95 but it got lost in the mail so I got a refund. Few weeks later it showed up lol\n\nSSD: Crucial t705 gen 5 ssd 2tb On sale at Amazon for ~$160\n\nOverall I’m really proud of this and surprised it even turned on first try lol. Lmk your thoughts!",

It's a similar rig to friends who aren't feeling the same issues. Was under the impression this PC should be completely *fine* for well optimised games in 2025.\n\nI'm having issues running games as of late. Battlefield 6 is *unplayable* for me (even though it's widely reported as optimised and my PC meets min specs as far as I know) on anything but ultra low settings with DLSS on ultra performance, constant frame drops around 40-50fps. It *defaulted* to max settings presumably because of my specs.\n\nArc Raiders playtest was also struggling to maintain 60fps on medium settings, especially with Discord open in the background.\n\nIt has always felt like I'm getting a bit less performance than I really should with how 'fine' my PC is, quite often wobbling around 60fps on certain titles that should probably run better.\n\n* I have drivers fully updated.\n* I have all but Discord and a couple other things running in the background closed, nothing that's hogging much in task manager whilst playing. Very few startup apps.\n* I don't know what any of the specs really *mean*, I'm completely non-technical with PC *parts* (but understand the things that would slow it down whilst using).\n\nJust looking for support/advice if anyone's able to offer. Are any of these PC specs *so* shit that they could be causing my issues? Outside of that, any other possible solutions?",

I was trying to save some money so I opted to keep my EVGA PSU and my RTX 4090 and use them in my new build.\n\nThen I kept having noisy fan issues with the EVGA. I was kind of kicking myself for not just ponying up for an ATX 3.1 PSU. \n\nI made a post on buildapc asking about which PSUs come with nice sleeved cables. Cablemod reached out and asked which PSU I was looking at. I answered them and they sent me a store code to get a whole new set of cables. I ended up saving like $200 or more thanks to them, and my cables are beautiful.\n\nSo yeah, they are great. Every experience I've had with them has been awesome.

El precio varía la rayzen en cuesta $50 más. Yo hago más trabajo de oficina, uso de Office, pero también juego de vez en cuando y muy ocasionalmente edito. Quiero una computadora algo potente que no necesite cambiar en un par de años. Cuál sería la mejor opción",

My uncle said an NVIDIA Quadro FX 5800(which is a GPU I already have...) is good enough to multitask 3d modeling, art applications, games, and intense music composition(which alone requires 32 gigs of DDR4/5 ram). I say a 1660 super is good. Then there was another hassle about specs(such as CPU, storage(which I already know I need 4tb for, music n games take up lots of storage), motherboard, etc...) I just wanted to know: What exactly are the minimum specs I should get for this PC? Are there any cost-efficient/budget builds for what I need?",

They promised to get a HDD with recovered data and a replacement HDD.\n\nThey received it on the 22nd of August 2025. Recovery was expected to be done by the 3rd of October 2025. On the 23rd of October I asked for an update. Shortly after I received a message that the recovery failed, and that my HDD will be recycled. I asked urgently not to do that, to send ti back to me. They said that they will send back only the platters and that I will not get any functional HDD.\n\nWhat do you think about this? Is this service fake or not ? Were they lacking time and they just gave up on the recovery and said \"no recovery\" to manage theirs resources?\n\nWhat should I do now?\n\nHow can I properly recover my data and is the data recoverable if they send the HDD in the form of platters?\n\nThis is shocking and highly unexpected and I would truly appreciate any feedback on this situation.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Just a question out of curiosity after looking at the extra buttons on my G502 and pondering about the finger flexibility required to reach extra buttons.\n\nWe've had gaming mice that offer the usual side buttons where the thumb rests, extra side buttons to the sides of the left mouse button that simply require moving your finger to the left, but have we ever had a gaming mouse or any mouse with extra buttons at the very end of each main mouse button? Just thinking about it has me thinking it's such a simple place to put them and would only require a simple straighten vs bend of the finger depending which you wanted to click. The main left and right mouse buttons would require a shorted profile but still.\n\nPS. Don't mind the crude MSPaint doodle.",

Be sure to remap controls as they are old school by default lol. Quick Save and Quick Load are my best friends as playing on harder difficulty there is a lot of dying, fond memories coming back....",

I was the lucky one to be selected as the winner! The PC  was even more glorious in person. Here's a quick rundown of the specs:\n\nIntel Core i5-14600K Processor\n\nZotac RTX 5060 Graphics Card\n\nASUS STRIX Z790-I Motherboard\n\nCooler Master 850W SFX Power Supply\n\nTrident Z 32GB DDR5 6000MT/s Memory\n\nWD BLACK 1TB SN7100 NVMe SSD (7,250MB/s)\n\n  \nThis thing fired right up and performed so well...I was getting well over 60 FPS on high settings while playing Battlefield 6.\n\n  \nHuge thanks goes to u/DaKrazyKid for running the giveaway and SignalRGB for building such a cool PC! This is going to be quite a conversation piece for years to come.\n\n\n\n  \n",

Not keen on delidding it. To shit scared to do so. \n\nAnyway, im not doing a custom loop. Im just using my AiO cooler for my CPU. \n\nNOW, here comes the real question:\n\nWhat can I use to protect my copper plate of my AiO cooler against the LM? Both the AiO cooler and the AiO cooler on my GPU has a copper plate. Will the LM just stain the copper or will it eat away at it? \n\nWould this even make a difference to cooling?\n\nIm getting a GPU gasket, thermal putty and Conductonaut from Thermal Grizzly. And will also use a gasket on the contact frame of my CPU. \n\nAny feedback will be appreciated. \n\nAttached is a picture of my system, to show what im working with.\n\nThanks",

Just thinking about it has me thinking it's such a simple place to put them and would only require a simple straighten vs bend of the finger depending which you wanted to click.

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

    "selftext": "I've been playing FPS game for a while, using Ikea solid wood tabletop with 2 alex drawer on each side, and a regular office chair, but i have been having pain on my right back muscle where I hold my mouse, I'm thinking it's the chair problem, so after a few months I bite the bullet and bought the HM Embody gaming chair.\n\nUnfortunately that doesn't seems to fix my problem and seems to make it worse in some way, because I want good control on my mouse, I want my elbow to be slightly or same level of my desk on my sit up straight position, but that means I would have to put my chair near the highest height, and my footrest of 12cm are barely touching my feet, not really feel supported.\n\nThen, my thigh and leg feel numb, because the embody chair seems to be softer on the back, and it cut off blood circulation for my entire thigh and leg, this impact my gaming performance by huge, always adjusting myself feels like something is off.\n\nI'm 5'9\" (175cm) and 219lbs (99kg), could this be my overweight problem (I'm trying to lose weight...) and my desk problem, i feel like the right desk height should be my current desk height \\~75cm minus my footrest 12cm, so the ideal desk height for me is something around 63\\~65cm? i don't really see desk that are that low...\n\nAnyone have solution to the issue?",

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

It is a great setup to have in such a small case/package! This and my Steam Deck is a whole portable gaming setup or this and my laptop is a full productivity setup! \n\n\nNext I'd like to see how you take your keebs to work or school or travel!

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

Overall feels expensive.\n\nBuild quality 10/10 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mpl47f4fowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae90f1ab48f6aab4d5b4eadaf9bd55c81359175d\n\nThe keyboard looks pretty darn well first look, giving off that \"cute aesthetic\" vibe to it (IMHO), I was a bit disappointed because my whole setup is dark/black and the keyboard is standing out between all the dark parts of my PC. I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/osqvzf04zpwf1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934d86fd6b2611ac9c1986eb8209ea86c09bf7b4\n\nA quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design.

They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

I have Zeal PC Zilent V2 62 gram silent tactile switches which helps to keep the noise down. The case I use is a Ltgem stethoscope case recommended to me by another redditor many years ago when I first built it.\n\n\nAs for what I bring with it, I bring a little USB wireless mouse to use with my Steam Deck, USB cables for my phone, Steam Deck, laptop and iPad with adapters/hubs for all. It is a great setup to have in such a small case/package! This and my Steam Deck is a whole portable gaming setup or this and my laptop is a full productivity setup! \n\n\nNext I'd like to see how you take your keebs to work or school or travel! What accessories do you bring? What type of cases do you use?",

However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

It is a great setup to have in such a small case/package!

However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

Connecting the KTC through either HDMI or DP-USB-c leads to the same effect.\n* It's not about the DP-USB-C cable on the ASUS. I've tested swapping the DP-USB-C cables and the result was the same.\n* It's not about the Dock. The effect is the same on the TB4 dock or using the computer's dedicated ports.\n* None of this is an issue on my other Macbook, an M1 Max (Ventura).\n\nMy current intuition is that somehow the KTC is \"faster\" at doing the handshake regardless of the protocol, and my M4 Pro somehow is shutting the recognition window for the slower monitor. And somehow this is an issue for Pro video cards and not for Max ones, regardless of age. Or maybe it's a Sequoia bug?\n\nIs there a way to fix this? Is the culprit the old ASUS monitor?\n\nChatGPT suggests I use an EDID emulator to delay the HPD of the KTC monitor. Does that make sense?",

I’ve seen a few high-end flat models (like the ASUS ROG Swift PG32UCDM and LG UltraGear 32GS95UE), and some curved OLEDs that are only 1440p or ultrawide, but not full 4K *and* curved *and* 240Hz.\n\nSo far, the only one that might fit all three specs is the **Gigabyte FO32U2P**, but I’m not sure if it’s actually curved or if that’s just marketing. Alienware’s 32\" 4K 240Hz QD-OLED also pops up in searches, but details on curvature are mixed. I need it mostly for Films, I might be willing to settle for a non curved if I cant find it but the black colour is also a big issue.\n\nHas anyone seen a *confirmed* curved black 4K OLED 240Hz model that’s actually released (not just announced)?  \nOr is it still something that’ll roll out next year?\n\nThanks in advance, I’d appreciate any real user experience or confirmed info!",

Loved it.\nThen I removed the protective film, crumpled it up, and tossed it in the trash.\n\nWhen I looked at my monitor again, I had the horrible realization: the panel wasn't reflective anymore. It never was. The thing that made it \"reflective\" was, in reality, the protective film.\n\nAh... The universe truly works in very funny ways sometimes.\n\nNow, my question is: is there any product to make this achievable again? And if so, what keywords should I use? I've looked up \"24 inch screen protector\" but all I find is anti-glare/matte ones.\n\nEven if there is something to reproduce the effect, should I go through all that trouble or just return this monitor and return to my search for glassy monitors?",

    "selftext": "Hi /r/monitors 👋\n\nI'm replacing my wife's monitor, it's mostly for productivity but I'll occasionally use it for gaming. Mini LED feels like a great choice here, kind of a best of both worlds. I'd go for a great IPS panel, but given working needs, I'd rather not do an OLED. Targeting 27\" 4K, as 32\" feels a bit much.\n\nHowever, my wife insists that the new monitor be white. That really cuts down on the number of options -- even the monitors with a white backing plate, like BenQ EX321UX, tend to have a black bezel on the front.\n\nOne route would be to tape & cover the screen, then spraypaint, but that's risky. What I'd prefer is if the monitor can be disassembled enough to remove the bezel, then I go paint that separately. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on either:\n- Good monitors with a white bezel that satisfy my specs \n- Good monitors that hit my specs and can be safely disassembled enough to remove the bezel\n- Guides on how to most safely protect the screen in case of spray painting\n\nThank you!\n",

Nowadays we have plenty of good and reasonable priced gpus which can run 4K nicely (with upscaling) and modern console games looks great on 32\" 4K  (PS4, Xbox One X, PS5, Series X)\n\n1080p any refresh rate is the best for competitive responsive gaming without needing to sacrifice visuals if they matter, and with 24-27\" you get anyways decent picture for fast paced FPS games and again console games are also nice with smaller 1080p screens.\n\nSo these are my thoughts, in my case I have ditched 1440p for now, it was mistake at least in my experience.\nQHD is probably nice for productivity but...\nWhat you think about all this?",

    "selftext": "I was waiting for MSI MPG 274URDFW E16M for a very long time, but its release was postponed time after time and at some point I gave up and got myself KOORUI S2741LM (KOORUI is a brand of HKC) while it was on sale on Amazon. I had this monitor for a few weeks now and I have some thoughts, so prepare for a wall of text. But first...\n\n# The specs!\n\nKOORUI S2741LM has an IPS panel with mini LED backlight and a Quantum Dot layer. I couldn't find the amount of dimming zones in any official docs, but I believe it has 1152 of them. I'm too lazy to count them manually. It's a 27\" 4K (UHD) wide gamut panel with 1000:1 native contrast ratio. It has [DisplayHDR 1400 certification](https://displayhdr.org/certified-products/). Official specs list the panel as 10 bit, but Amazon listing says it's 8 bit panel with FRC. I don't have any means to test that, but I haven't noticed any FRC related issues. Colour gamut coverage is: 100% sRGB, 99% Adobe RGB and 98% DCI P3. The panel comes pre-calibrated with a report paper.\n\nThere are four display inputs: two HDMI 2.1, DP1.4 and USB C with 90W power delivery for a laptop. This monitor can do 160 Hz at 4K with DSC enabled over each input. It also supports a dual mode - 1080p at 320 Hz. The response time is listed as 1ms. S2741LM has a USB hub with two USB A ports. I believe it's USB 2.0. The monitor supports VRR, of course.\n\n# Build quality\n\nBuild quality is surprisingly good for a £400 monitor! My more expensive monitors feel more flimsy and squeak a lot more. S2741LM on the other hand has minimal wobble when you tap it on the sides and makes pretty much no noise when you adjust it. With that said it is still a cheap monitor made from plastic, so don't expect full aluminium-manganese body.\n\nThis monitor is using a power brick as a power supply. On one hand I'm not a fan, but on the other hand, my other 4K monitors love to blast me with 40° warm air in the face, but this one definitely runs a bit cooler at the same brightness levels. I guess I'm fine with the brick...\n\n# SDR Colour Accuracy\n\nKOORUI S2741LM comes pre-calibrated from the factory, but it doesn't come with a colour profile. What that means is that its factory calibration is pretty much useless. You will only get correct and accurate colours if you go into monitor settings and clamp it to sRGB mode and set Windows to sRGB profile. But you will lose wide gamut support, so that's not an option. You can also clamp the monitor to Adobe RGB or DCI P3, but Windows doesn't have built-in profiles for these colour spaces, so that won't work either. If you leave the monitor in its default state, then you will not have accurate colours at all.\n\nSo I decided to re-calibrate the monitor using Calibrite Display Plus HL and I got an average delta E of 1.7, which is a great result. You can download my profile [from here](https://hexmode.quickconnect.to/d/s/15WCClArshUyAYo24DL8XpRMecgY8ffZ/x9vdTLmUcZGc-yMQzCwb0ifxjaYtGJeD-KrugvKY7rww). Please note that it was calibrated at 160 nits to match Adobe RGB spec. As I do quite a bit of photography, Adobe RGB calibration target is what I use on all my monitors. To use this profile, disable DCR, leave contrast at 50, set monitor gamma setting to Gamma1, set colour to Standard, scenario mode also Standard and turn off local dimming.\n\nEnable colour management in Windows. Also enable ACM in Windows 11. Then load my profile as SDR profile.\n\nA note on ACM in Windows 11. Some apps like Chrome (and all browsers based on Chromium, like Vivaldi) don't support ACM yet. Such apps will be force clamped to sRGB, which will result in dull colours when viewing wide gamut content. If you're using such apps, open Properties, go to Compatibility tab and enable \"Use legacy display ICC colour management\". You can check your browser if it is properly colour managed by visiting [https://www.wide-gamut.com/](https://www.wide-gamut.com/).\n\nOnce calibrated and properly configured, the monitor looks pretty similar to my other calibrated monitors. It also has a very wide gamut covering both Adobe RGB and DCI P3 to a great extent. You can see [gamut coverage report here](https://hexmode.quickconnect.to/d/s/15WCvphlRrWpVKc6GtT6Edtsam6J3m6L/Rgt2quGA5YoOynLy9rIEW51fetTXo7_k-SLsgztg9rww), monitor profile is indicated by a blue line, red line indicated Adobe RGB, pink line - DCI P3 and green line - sRGB. Native contrast was measured at 1006:1 and white point coordinates are very close to EDID reported value, that means that it is actually calibrated at the factory. It's a shame that KOORUI did not provide an ICM profile...\n\n# SDR Brightness\n\nI haven't measured the peak brightness in SDR mode, but 400 nits are at 57 brightness level. I'd say it should go up to 600 nits in SDR mode. Here's a brightness level table I measured.\n\n|Level|Nits|\n|:-|:-|\n|10|80|\n|13|101|\n|16|122|\n|22|160|\n|28|205|\n|35|252|\n|42|299|\n|57|401|\n\nAs someone who uses a monitor for work during day time, I'm really happy that I can crank it up to 400+ nits. I have no idea how people are using monitors which can't deliver enough brightness. My 9 years old monitor standing nearby can barely deliver 220 nits these days due to backlight degradation, and it's pretty much invisible at full brightness on a sunny day. KOORUI S2741LM replaced a broken monitor which was only doing 170 nits, and it was completely useless during the summer.\n\n# SDR Gaming\n\nThere are three levels of response time in the settings: Normal, Fast and Fastest. I don't have a software to measure response times, but Fast looks the best at 160Hz - minimal blur and no overshoot. DisplayCAL does some rudimentary measurements, they hover between 4 and 9ms, but I don't think it is a valid measurement.\n\nThe games I played so far are: League Of Legends, The Finals, Cyberpunk 2077, No Man's Sky, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 and Death Stranding.\n\nThe blur is hardly noticeable during regular playing sessions, but you can definitely notice some when moving LoL map around rapidly and focusing on it. I use SDR mode without local dimming so lag is minimal.\n\n1080p @ 320Hz mode looks like integer scaling on a static image, but something is off when playing. My feeling is that integer scaling has a sub pixel offset. If I put some black pixels on a white background or vice versa in Photoshop the picture looks like the monitor is doing integer scaling. But with different colours and gradients something is off, but it is barely noticeable when playing fast-paced games like The Finals. Switching to a slower paced game like Senua 2 and I want to switch back to 4K.\n\nI would say use 1080p @ 320Hz mode for fast-paced competitive games, but you will be better off with DLSS P + Framegen at 4K in slow paced story driven games.\n\n# HDR Colour Accuracy\n\nThis monitor doesn't come with an HDR colour profile either, so by default everything looks wacky. I recommend you run Windows HDR calibration tool. It's a simple tool and won't produce a super accurate colour profile, but it will fix crushed whites, washed out blacks and hyper saturated reds. When I ran Windows HDR calibration tool, I set black point until I couldn't see the cross, then I set white point to 1,400 nits and saturation to 30. That gave me the best results so far.\n\nCalibrite Profiler software I use for colour calibration does not support HDR properly yet, but once they roll out HDR update I will this post a proper HDR ICM profile here. Calibrite promised proper HDR support by the end of this year. I haven't measured HDR brightness levels, but filling the screen with a white colour with +4 stops boost in Photoshop can be described as BRIGHT AF.\n\nBrightness control is not disabled when in HDR mode, which is great.\n\n# HDR Experience\n\nKOORUI S2741LM has four local dimming settings: High, Medium, Low and Off. Low and Off are completely unusable in HDR.\n\nHigh is most pleasant for most high quality HDR content like Blu-Ray movies and remuxes, as well as games with good HDR mastering like Senua 2. Low bitrate content suffers from compression artifacts which lead to crushed blacks and whites, and that results in high levels of blooming. It is better to use Medium setting for low quality HDR content.\n\nI have watched Paradise show which has a very poor colour grading. The only time when the bloom was really noticeable was in the second episode during the interrogation scene - for some reason show makers decided to put a protagonist in a very dark room and make his shirt brighter than the sun. I have no idea what is wrong with the people who made this show...\n\nI also watched Alita: Battle Angel (Blu-ray). It has much better grading and looks much better. Haven't noticed any blooming. The same can be said about Andor S1 (Blu-ray). Say what you want about Disney, but they sure do know how to master HDR! Andor looks like a candy!\n\nBut the biggest shock came from Planet Earth III (Blu-ray)! I compared it to an OLED and, my god, OLED is barely an SDR! Mini LED really shines in natural daylight scenes. That's when you can really enjoy the HDR and S2741LM can deliver insane brightness while maintaining excellent contrast, and it's a real viewing pleasure!\n\nAnd then there was another shock - DSLR photo mastering in HDR in Lightroom Classic. My camera can capture 14.6 stops according to DXO testing. SDR monitors can show 5-6 stops according to BBC engineers. Switching to HDR mastering is really mind-blowing! You can see so much more! Imagine a bright cloudy day. SDR preview shows you flat grey sky and dark trees. You switch to HDR mode, and suddenly you see loads of details in the clouds and shadow get lifted and more detailed too. If you are a photographer - you must switch to a mini LED yesterday!\n\n# Issues\n\nOverall I'm very happy with KOORUI S2741LM, but it's not perfect.\n\nFirst, it doesn't come with SDR and HDR profiles. That's a bummer. Especially since these monitors are calibrated at the factory, so HKC/KOORUI already have the profiles. Why don't they share them? Is it so hard to upload a 30kB file to your hosting?\n\nThen there is an issue that the monitor doesn't turn off its backlight when going into stand-by mode. It only turns off when you power down your PC. This is very annoying.\n\nThe USB hub is meh - USB 2.0 and only two USB A ports. Is it really so hard to make it USB 3.2 and add two USB C ports into the mix? I would gladly pay £100 more just to have a better hub.\n\nIt is also very hard to plug anything into any ports due to port layout. Thankfully, I don't plug cables that often.\n\nViewing angles are not the best. I always thought that the viewing angles were one of the main selling points of IPS panels and this is my only IPS monitor which changes brightness when viewed off angle. How? Why?\n\nS2741LM has very small bezels. It looks nice, but that feature has a downside - brightness fall off at the edges. It's not a big deal most of the time, but it is noticeable and annoying when you have white window in full screen. I would prefer to have thicker bezels with a more even backlight around the edges.\n\nLocal dimming in SDR mode is extremely conservative and tries extremely hard to avoid any blooming even at the highest setting. But it is unusable without a specific colour calibration as zones with low contrast (like light grey text on dark grey background) lose all the contrast (and text becomes nearly unreadable). I'm too lazy to create a special profile, so I keep local dimming off in SDR. Maybe some day... Or maybe KOORUI will read this review and will release colour profiles!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs I've already said, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. KOORUI S2741LM is great for general productivity, CAD work, graphical design, photo and video work. It is also a good gaming monitor and an excellent HDR display. It has some issues, but they're minor for me. Colour accuracy, text clarity and brightness are more important to me.\n\nIf you have any questions - I will be glad to answer them.",

I’m returning it. Has anyone else had this problem with SW272U?

I am sticking to 27 inch in size, but I am conflicted between 1440p 360hz vs 4k 240hz, I am leaning towards the latter, the only problem is I am unable to find any decent options for the latter in my country (India), my only two options being the AW2725Q from Alienware, and G81SF from Samsung, the G81SF has a aggressive matte coating problem, while the AW2725Q doesn't include a 3.5 mm jack and adding to it is the random black out of many monitors faced by a lot of users. While in the 1440p 360hz section I am pretty locked in for FO27Q3.\n\nSo I wanted to ask if there are any other 27 inch 4k 240hz monitors available in India or Bangalore offline, that I haven't gone through yet?",

Both are IPS panel but my old acer monitor had perfect vibrant colors and able to display it's 250 nits peak SDR brightness.\n\nEver since I tried my new viewsonic monitor, I'm in denial that this new monitor is really inferior to my old acer monitor. I narrowed down the issue to the coating on both of these monitors. My acer monitor had good semi glossy finish whereas viewsonic one has hard matte coating which is not allowing me to acheive peak SDR brighness which is advertised as 300 nits.\n\nIn addition to this hard matte coating this monitor has no gamma settings at all. It has only Vue and Color saturation setting which makes it even harder for me to see the brightness of this monitor.\n\nMy work is full of coding for 4-10 hours + additional 4 hours on video editing/gaming.\n\nSuggest me some good glossy or semi-glossy monitors in 2K resolution range even if it's only usable with HDMI",

Also, are OLED monitors worth it for console gaming, or should I stick with a high-end LCD?\n\nI would still want my game to look as best as it can be with the best possible frames etc and least controller delay. \n\nWould really appreciate any recommendations for the best monitors that suit competitive play.\n\nI currently have an ASUS 24” 1080 240hz monitor however it’s only 2.0 HDMI. I can feel the delay quite alot especially compared to how smooth it feels in PC. I know it won’t be as smooth as that, but my friends who switched don’t have this delay problem like I do. \n\nThanks! ",

    "selftext": "I just got my first OLED monitor, the MSI MAG 272qpw. The color contrast is great and all, blacks are nice and deep, but reading text really hurts my head. I use my PC for 60% work from home and 40% gaming, and while gaming is amazing, text (even in games) sucks. I sit pretty close to my monitor so I definitely notice the fringing. Every 5 minutes the entire display shifts a pixel, which can be dizzying. Also, I feel like the colors can be over saturated. I’m coming from a cheapo decogear 1440p 120hz VA, much easier on the eyes for productivity but the black smearing is absolutely horrendous. \n\nAm I stuck with IPS then? I’ll have about 600usd when I return this so wondering if that is a good budget for a good display. Or should I be looking for mini-LED? Google didn’t turn up very many options for that (looking for 3440x1440). Or maybe OLED technology is too into its infancy and I should wait it out until there are less drawbacks.",

I don’t even know if it’s just the OLED magic or if MSI really nailed something here, but the difference is night and day.\n\nThe first thing that hit me was the contrast. Blacks are actually black — like the screen disappears in dark scenes — and the colours just pop without feeling cartoonish. Games I’ve played a hundred times suddenly look completely different, like they’ve got more depth or atmosphere. Even desktop stuff feels smoother and cleaner somehow.\n\nThe 240 Hz refresh rate feels incredible too. I thought my old 165 Hz IPS was already fast, but this just feels more fluid and precise. \n\nBuild quality’s solid as well. The stand is sturdy, bezels are slim, and overall it feels more premium than I expected. But it could have been better looking.\n\nNo signs of burn-in yet, though I’m still paranoid about static stuff. MSI’s got some built-in screen protection features, and I’ve been letting it run its refresh cycles regularly.\n\nOverall, switching from IPS to this feels like a massive upgrade. The image quality, the smoothness, the way everything just feels better — it’s honestly hard to go back. I don’t know if it’s purely because it’s OLED or if MSI just nailed this model, but either way, this monitor is ridiculous.",

    "selftext": "We’ve started a **partnership with Titan Army** and will be showcasing new models going forward (with honest community feedback) and probably some giveaways in the future. First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

I use my PC for 60% work from home and 40% gaming, and while gaming is amazing, text (even in games) sucks. I sit pretty close to my monitor so I definitely notice the fringing. Every 5 minutes the entire display shifts a pixel, which can be dizzying. Also, I feel like the colors can be over saturated. I’m coming from a cheapo decogear 1440p 120hz VA, much easier on the eyes for productivity but the black smearing is absolutely horrendous. \n\nAm I stuck with IPS then? I’ll have about 600usd when I return this so wondering if that is a good budget for a good display. Or should I be looking for mini-LED? Google didn’t turn up very many options for that (looking for 3440x1440). Or maybe OLED technology is too into its infancy and I should wait it out until there are less drawbacks.",

I am looking for a 27\" 1440p (144hz and up) screen that ideally is within £300 price range.\n\nAnything will probably be an upgrade at this point considering how outdated the current monitor I have is but there seems to be so many options.\n\nI don't really play competitive games that much anymore, but I do enjoy multiplayer FPS games like Battlefield 6 alongside singleplayer titles. I have looked into AOC Q27G3XMN but I've been reading some bad things about noticeable smearing and VRR flicker, also seen mixed opinions on Xiaomi G Pro 27i.\n\nSo here I am, asking for any advice, are there any hidden gems out there, monitors that are within that price range that are overlooked or ones you had good experiences with.\n\nEDIT: I use it for gaming but also for plenty of static content such as web browsing, youtube etc so any budget OLEDs if there even is any are probably a no no.",

Connecting the KTC through either HDMI or DP-USB-c leads to the same effect.\n* It's not about the DP-USB-C cable on the ASUS. I've tested swapping the DP-USB-C cables and the result was the same.\n* It's not about the Dock. The effect is the same on the TB4 dock or using the computer's dedicated ports.\n* None of this is an issue on my other Macbook, an M1 Max (Ventura).\n\nMy current intuition is that somehow the KTC is \"faster\" at doing the handshake regardless of the protocol, and my M4 Pro somehow is shutting the recognition window for the slower monitor. And somehow this is an issue for Pro video cards and not for Max ones, regardless of age. Or maybe it's a Sequoia bug?\n\nIs there a way to fix this? Is the culprit the old ASUS monitor?\n\nChatGPT suggests I use an EDID emulator to delay the HPD of the KTC monitor. Does that make sense?",

I had this monitor for a few weeks now and I have some thoughts, so prepare for a wall of text. But first...\n\n# The specs!\n\nKOORUI S2741LM has an IPS panel with mini LED backlight and a Quantum Dot layer. I couldn't find the amount of dimming zones in any official docs, but I believe it has 1152 of them. I'm too lazy to count them manually. It's a 27\" 4K (UHD) wide gamut panel with 1000:1 native contrast ratio. It has [DisplayHDR 1400 certification](https://displayhdr.org/certified-products/). Official specs list the panel as 10 bit, but Amazon listing says it's 8 bit panel with FRC. I don't have any means to test that, but I haven't noticed any FRC related issues. Colour gamut coverage is: 100% sRGB, 99% Adobe RGB and 98% DCI P3. The panel comes pre-calibrated with a report paper.\n\nThere are four display inputs: two HDMI 2.1, DP1.4 and USB C with 90W power delivery for a laptop. This monitor can do 160 Hz at 4K with DSC enabled over each input. It also supports a dual mode - 1080p at 320 Hz. The response time is listed as 1ms. S2741LM has a USB hub with two USB A ports. I believe it's USB 2.0. The monitor supports VRR, of course.\n\n# Build quality\n\nBuild quality is surprisingly good for a £400 monitor! My more expensive monitors feel more flimsy and squeak a lot more. S2741LM on the other hand has minimal wobble when you tap it on the sides and makes pretty much no noise when you adjust it. With that said it is still a cheap monitor made from plastic, so don't expect full aluminium-manganese body.\n\nThis monitor is using a power brick as a power supply. On one hand I'm not a fan, but on the other hand, my other 4K monitors love to blast me with 40° warm air in the face, but this one definitely runs a bit cooler at the same brightness levels. I guess I'm fine with the brick...\n\n# SDR Colour Accuracy\n\nKOORUI S2741LM comes pre-calibrated from the factory, but it doesn't come with a colour profile. What that means is that its factory calibration is pretty much useless. You will only get correct and accurate colours if you go into monitor settings and clamp it to sRGB mode and set Windows to sRGB profile. But you will lose wide gamut support, so that's not an option. You can also clamp the monitor to Adobe RGB or DCI P3, but Windows doesn't have built-in profiles for these colour spaces, so that won't work either. If you leave the monitor in its default state, then you will not have accurate colours at all.\n\nSo I decided to re-calibrate the monitor using Calibrite Display Plus HL and I got an average delta E of 1.7, which is a great result. You can download my profile [from here](https://hexmode.quickconnect.to/d/s/15WCClArshUyAYo24DL8XpRMecgY8ffZ/x9vdTLmUcZGc-yMQzCwb0ifxjaYtGJeD-KrugvKY7rww). Please note that it was calibrated at 160 nits to match Adobe RGB spec. As I do quite a bit of photography, Adobe RGB calibration target is what I use on all my monitors. To use this profile, disable DCR, leave contrast at 50, set monitor gamma setting to Gamma1, set colour to Standard, scenario mode also Standard and turn off local dimming.\n\nEnable colour management in Windows. Also enable ACM in Windows 11. Then load my profile as SDR profile.\n\nA note on ACM in Windows 11. Some apps like Chrome (and all browsers based on Chromium, like Vivaldi) don't support ACM yet. Such apps will be force clamped to sRGB, which will result in dull colours when viewing wide gamut content. If you're using such apps, open Properties, go to Compatibility tab and enable \"Use legacy display ICC colour management\". You can check your browser if it is properly colour managed by visiting [https://www.wide-gamut.com/](https://www.wide-gamut.com/).\n\nOnce calibrated and properly configured, the monitor looks pretty similar to my other calibrated monitors. It also has a very wide gamut covering both Adobe RGB and DCI P3 to a great extent. You can see [gamut coverage report here](https://hexmode.quickconnect.to/d/s/15WCvphlRrWpVKc6GtT6Edtsam6J3m6L/Rgt2quGA5YoOynLy9rIEW51fetTXo7_k-SLsgztg9rww), monitor profile is indicated by a blue line, red line indicated Adobe RGB, pink line - DCI P3 and green line - sRGB. Native contrast was measured at 1006:1 and white point coordinates are very close to EDID reported value, that means that it is actually calibrated at the factory. It's a shame that KOORUI did not provide an ICM profile...\n\n# SDR Brightness\n\nI haven't measured the peak brightness in SDR mode, but 400 nits are at 57 brightness level. I'd say it should go up to 600 nits in SDR mode. Here's a brightness level table I measured.\n\n|Level|Nits|\n|:-|:-|\n|10|80|\n|13|101|\n|16|122|\n|22|160|\n|28|205|\n|35|252|\n|42|299|\n|57|401|\n\nAs someone who uses a monitor for work during day time, I'm really happy that I can crank it up to 400+ nits. I have no idea how people are using monitors which can't deliver enough brightness. My 9 years old monitor standing nearby can barely deliver 220 nits these days due to backlight degradation, and it's pretty much invisible at full brightness on a sunny day. KOORUI S2741LM replaced a broken monitor which was only doing 170 nits, and it was completely useless during the summer.\n\n# SDR Gaming\n\nThere are three levels of response time in the settings: Normal, Fast and Fastest. I don't have a software to measure response times, but Fast looks the best at 160Hz - minimal blur and no overshoot. DisplayCAL does some rudimentary measurements, they hover between 4 and 9ms, but I don't think it is a valid measurement.\n\nThe games I played so far are: League Of Legends, The Finals, Cyberpunk 2077, No Man's Sky, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 and Death Stranding.\n\nThe blur is hardly noticeable during regular playing sessions, but you can definitely notice some when moving LoL map around rapidly and focusing on it. I use SDR mode without local dimming so lag is minimal.\n\n1080p @ 320Hz mode looks like integer scaling on a static image, but something is off when playing. My feeling is that integer scaling has a sub pixel offset. If I put some black pixels on a white background or vice versa in Photoshop the picture looks like the monitor is doing integer scaling. But with different colours and gradients something is off, but it is barely noticeable when playing fast-paced games like The Finals. Switching to a slower paced game like Senua 2 and I want to switch back to 4K.\n\nI would say use 1080p @ 320Hz mode for fast-paced competitive games, but you will be better off with DLSS P + Framegen at 4K in slow paced story driven games.\n\n# HDR Colour Accuracy\n\nThis monitor doesn't come with an HDR colour profile either, so by default everything looks wacky. I recommend you run Windows HDR calibration tool. It's a simple tool and won't produce a super accurate colour profile, but it will fix crushed whites, washed out blacks and hyper saturated reds. When I ran Windows HDR calibration tool, I set black point until I couldn't see the cross, then I set white point to 1,400 nits and saturation to 30. That gave me the best results so far.\n\nCalibrite Profiler software I use for colour calibration does not support HDR properly yet, but once they roll out HDR update I will this post a proper HDR ICM profile here. Calibrite promised proper HDR support by the end of this year. I haven't measured HDR brightness levels, but filling the screen with a white colour with +4 stops boost in Photoshop can be described as BRIGHT AF.\n\nBrightness control is not disabled when in HDR mode, which is great.\n\n# HDR Experience\n\nKOORUI S2741LM has four local dimming settings: High, Medium, Low and Off. Low and Off are completely unusable in HDR.\n\nHigh is most pleasant for most high quality HDR content like Blu-Ray movies and remuxes, as well as games with good HDR mastering like Senua 2. Low bitrate content suffers from compression artifacts which lead to crushed blacks and whites, and that results in high levels of blooming. It is better to use Medium setting for low quality HDR content.\n\nI have watched Paradise show which has a very poor colour grading. The only time when the bloom was really noticeable was in the second episode during the interrogation scene - for some reason show makers decided to put a protagonist in a very dark room and make his shirt brighter than the sun. I have no idea what is wrong with the people who made this show...\n\nI also watched Alita: Battle Angel (Blu-ray). It has much better grading and looks much better. Haven't noticed any blooming. The same can be said about Andor S1 (Blu-ray). Say what you want about Disney, but they sure do know how to master HDR! Andor looks like a candy!\n\nBut the biggest shock came from Planet Earth III (Blu-ray)! I compared it to an OLED and, my god, OLED is barely an SDR! Mini LED really shines in natural daylight scenes. That's when you can really enjoy the HDR and S2741LM can deliver insane brightness while maintaining excellent contrast, and it's a real viewing pleasure!\n\nAnd then there was another shock - DSLR photo mastering in HDR in Lightroom Classic. My camera can capture 14.6 stops according to DXO testing. SDR monitors can show 5-6 stops according to BBC engineers. Switching to HDR mastering is really mind-blowing! You can see so much more! Imagine a bright cloudy day. SDR preview shows you flat grey sky and dark trees. You switch to HDR mode, and suddenly you see loads of details in the clouds and shadow get lifted and more detailed too. If you are a photographer - you must switch to a mini LED yesterday!\n\n# Issues\n\nOverall I'm very happy with KOORUI S2741LM, but it's not perfect.\n\nFirst, it doesn't come with SDR and HDR profiles. That's a bummer. Especially since these monitors are calibrated at the factory, so HKC/KOORUI already have the profiles. Why don't they share them? Is it so hard to upload a 30kB file to your hosting?\n\nThen there is an issue that the monitor doesn't turn off its backlight when going into stand-by mode. It only turns off when you power down your PC. This is very annoying.\n\nThe USB hub is meh - USB 2.0 and only two USB A ports. Is it really so hard to make it USB 3.2 and add two USB C ports into the mix? I would gladly pay £100 more just to have a better hub.\n\nIt is also very hard to plug anything into any ports due to port layout. Thankfully, I don't plug cables that often.\n\nViewing angles are not the best. I always thought that the viewing angles were one of the main selling points of IPS panels and this is my only IPS monitor which changes brightness when viewed off angle. How? Why?\n\nS2741LM has very small bezels. It looks nice, but that feature has a downside - brightness fall off at the edges. It's not a big deal most of the time, but it is noticeable and annoying when you have white window in full screen. I would prefer to have thicker bezels with a more even backlight around the edges.\n\nLocal dimming in SDR mode is extremely conservative and tries extremely hard to avoid any blooming even at the highest setting. But it is unusable without a specific colour calibration as zones with low contrast (like light grey text on dark grey background) lose all the contrast (and text becomes nearly unreadable). I'm too lazy to create a special profile, so I keep local dimming off in SDR. Maybe some day... Or maybe KOORUI will read this review and will release colour profiles!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs I've already said, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. KOORUI S2741LM is great for general productivity, CAD work, graphical design, photo and video work. It is also a good gaming monitor and an excellent HDR display. It has some issues, but they're minor for me. Colour accuracy, text clarity and brightness are more important to me.\n\nIf you have any questions - I will be glad to answer them.",

Nowadays we have plenty of good and reasonable priced gpus which can run 4K nicely (with upscaling) and modern console games looks great on 32\" 4K  (PS4, Xbox One X, PS5, Series X)\n\n1080p any refresh rate is the best for competitive responsive gaming without needing to sacrifice visuals if they matter, and with 24-27\" you get anyways decent picture for fast paced FPS games and again console games are also nice with smaller 1080p screens.\n\nSo these are my thoughts, in my case I have ditched 1440p for now, it was mistake at least in my experience.\nQHD is probably nice for productivity but...\nWhat you think about all this?",

    "selftext": "I switched to the MSI MAG 271QPX QD-OLED (E2) from a high-end IPS panel I’d been using for a few years, and honestly… I’m still kind of in shock at how good this thing looks. I don’t even know if it’s just the OLED magic or if MSI really nailed something here, but the difference is night and day.\n\nThe first thing that hit me was the contrast. Blacks are actually black — like the screen disappears in dark scenes — and the colours just pop without feeling cartoonish. Games I’ve played a hundred times suddenly look completely different, like they’ve got more depth or atmosphere. Even desktop stuff feels smoother and cleaner somehow.\n\nThe 240 Hz refresh rate feels incredible too. I thought my old 165 Hz IPS was already fast, but this just feels more fluid and precise. \n\nBuild quality’s solid as well. The stand is sturdy, bezels are slim, and overall it feels more premium than I expected. But it could have been better looking.\n\nNo signs of burn-in yet, though I’m still paranoid about static stuff. MSI’s got some built-in screen protection features, and I’ve been letting it run its refresh cycles regularly.\n\nOverall, switching from IPS to this feels like a massive upgrade. The image quality, the smoothness, the way everything just feels better — it’s honestly hard to go back. I don’t know if it’s purely because it’s OLED or if MSI just nailed this model, but either way, this monitor is ridiculous.",

    "selftext": "Hi /r/monitors 👋\n\nI'm replacing my wife's monitor, it's mostly for productivity but I'll occasionally use it for gaming. Mini LED feels like a great choice here, kind of a best of both worlds. I'd go for a great IPS panel, but given working needs, I'd rather not do an OLED. Targeting 27\" 4K, as 32\" feels a bit much.\n\nHowever, my wife insists that the new monitor be white. That really cuts down on the number of options -- even the monitors with a white backing plate, like BenQ EX321UX, tend to have a black bezel on the front.\n\nOne route would be to tape & cover the screen, then spraypaint, but that's risky. What I'd prefer is if the monitor can be disassembled enough to remove the bezel, then I go paint that separately. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on either:\n- Good monitors with a white bezel that satisfy my specs \n- Good monitors that hit my specs and can be safely disassembled enough to remove the bezel\n- Guides on how to most safely protect the screen in case of spray painting\n\nThank you!\n",

    "title": "KOORUI S2741LM user review",
    "selftext": "I was waiting for MSI MPG 274URDFW E16M for a very long time, but its release was postponed time after time and at some point I gave up and got myself KOORUI S2741LM (KOORUI is a brand of HKC) while it was on sale on Amazon. I had this monitor for a few weeks now and I have some thoughts, so prepare for a wall of text. But first...\n\n# The specs!\n\nKOORUI S2741LM has an IPS panel with mini LED backlight and a Quantum Dot layer. I couldn't find the amount of dimming zones in any official docs, but I believe it has 1152 of them. I'm too lazy to count them manually. It's a 27\" 4K (UHD) wide gamut panel with 1000:1 native contrast ratio. It has [DisplayHDR 1400 certification](https://displayhdr.org/certified-products/). Official specs list the panel as 10 bit, but Amazon listing says it's 8 bit panel with FRC. I don't have any means to test that, but I haven't noticed any FRC related issues. Colour gamut coverage is: 100% sRGB, 99% Adobe RGB and 98% DCI P3. The panel comes pre-calibrated with a report paper.\n\nThere are four display inputs: two HDMI 2.1, DP1.4 and USB C with 90W power delivery for a laptop. This monitor can do 160 Hz at 4K with DSC enabled over each input. It also supports a dual mode - 1080p at 320 Hz. The response time is listed as 1ms. S2741LM has a USB hub with two USB A ports. I believe it's USB 2.0. The monitor supports VRR, of course.\n\n# Build quality\n\nBuild quality is surprisingly good for a £400 monitor! My more expensive monitors feel more flimsy and squeak a lot more. S2741LM on the other hand has minimal wobble when you tap it on the sides and makes pretty much no noise when you adjust it. With that said it is still a cheap monitor made from plastic, so don't expect full aluminium-manganese body.\n\nThis monitor is using a power brick as a power supply. On one hand I'm not a fan, but on the other hand, my other 4K monitors love to blast me with 40° warm air in the face, but this one definitely runs a bit cooler at the same brightness levels. I guess I'm fine with the brick...\n\n# SDR Colour Accuracy\n\nKOORUI S2741LM comes pre-calibrated from the factory, but it doesn't come with a colour profile. What that means is that its factory calibration is pretty much useless. You will only get correct and accurate colours if you go into monitor settings and clamp it to sRGB mode and set Windows to sRGB profile. But you will lose wide gamut support, so that's not an option. You can also clamp the monitor to Adobe RGB or DCI P3, but Windows doesn't have built-in profiles for these colour spaces, so that won't work either. If you leave the monitor in its default state, then you will not have accurate colours at all.\n\nSo I decided to re-calibrate the monitor using Calibrite Display Plus HL and I got an average delta E of 1.7, which is a great result. You can download my profile [from here](https://hexmode.quickconnect.to/d/s/15WCClArshUyAYo24DL8XpRMecgY8ffZ/x9vdTLmUcZGc-yMQzCwb0ifxjaYtGJeD-KrugvKY7rww). Please note that it was calibrated at 160 nits to match Adobe RGB spec. As I do quite a bit of photography, Adobe RGB calibration target is what I use on all my monitors. To use this profile, disable DCR, leave contrast at 50, set monitor gamma setting to Gamma1, set colour to Standard, scenario mode also Standard and turn off local dimming.\n\nEnable colour management in Windows. Also enable ACM in Windows 11. Then load my profile as SDR profile.\n\nA note on ACM in Windows 11. Some apps like Chrome (and all browsers based on Chromium, like Vivaldi) don't support ACM yet. Such apps will be force clamped to sRGB, which will result in dull colours when viewing wide gamut content. If you're using such apps, open Properties, go to Compatibility tab and enable \"Use legacy display ICC colour management\". You can check your browser if it is properly colour managed by visiting [https://www.wide-gamut.com/](https://www.wide-gamut.com/).\n\nOnce calibrated and properly configured, the monitor looks pretty similar to my other calibrated monitors. It also has a very wide gamut covering both Adobe RGB and DCI P3 to a great extent. You can see [gamut coverage report here](https://hexmode.quickconnect.to/d/s/15WCvphlRrWpVKc6GtT6Edtsam6J3m6L/Rgt2quGA5YoOynLy9rIEW51fetTXo7_k-SLsgztg9rww), monitor profile is indicated by a blue line, red line indicated Adobe RGB, pink line - DCI P3 and green line - sRGB. Native contrast was measured at 1006:1 and white point coordinates are very close to EDID reported value, that means that it is actually calibrated at the factory. It's a shame that KOORUI did not provide an ICM profile...\n\n# SDR Brightness\n\nI haven't measured the peak brightness in SDR mode, but 400 nits are at 57 brightness level. I'd say it should go up to 600 nits in SDR mode. Here's a brightness level table I measured.\n\n|Level|Nits|\n|:-|:-|\n|10|80|\n|13|101|\n|16|122|\n|22|160|\n|28|205|\n|35|252|\n|42|299|\n|57|401|\n\nAs someone who uses a monitor for work during day time, I'm really happy that I can crank it up to 400+ nits. I have no idea how people are using monitors which can't deliver enough brightness. My 9 years old monitor standing nearby can barely deliver 220 nits these days due to backlight degradation, and it's pretty much invisible at full brightness on a sunny day. KOORUI S2741LM replaced a broken monitor which was only doing 170 nits, and it was completely useless during the summer.\n\n# SDR Gaming\n\nThere are three levels of response time in the settings: Normal, Fast and Fastest. I don't have a software to measure response times, but Fast looks the best at 160Hz - minimal blur and no overshoot. DisplayCAL does some rudimentary measurements, they hover between 4 and 9ms, but I don't think it is a valid measurement.\n\nThe games I played so far are: League Of Legends, The Finals, Cyberpunk 2077, No Man's Sky, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 and Death Stranding.\n\nThe blur is hardly noticeable during regular playing sessions, but you can definitely notice some when moving LoL map around rapidly and focusing on it. I use SDR mode without local dimming so lag is minimal.\n\n1080p @ 320Hz mode looks like integer scaling on a static image, but something is off when playing. My feeling is that integer scaling has a sub pixel offset. If I put some black pixels on a white background or vice versa in Photoshop the picture looks like the monitor is doing integer scaling. But with different colours and gradients something is off, but it is barely noticeable when playing fast-paced games like The Finals. Switching to a slower paced game like Senua 2 and I want to switch back to 4K.\n\nI would say use 1080p @ 320Hz mode for fast-paced competitive games, but you will be better off with DLSS P + Framegen at 4K in slow paced story driven games.\n\n# HDR Colour Accuracy\n\nThis monitor doesn't come with an HDR colour profile either, so by default everything looks wacky. I recommend you run Windows HDR calibration tool. It's a simple tool and won't produce a super accurate colour profile, but it will fix crushed whites, washed out blacks and hyper saturated reds. When I ran Windows HDR calibration tool, I set black point until I couldn't see the cross, then I set white point to 1,400 nits and saturation to 30. That gave me the best results so far.\n\nCalibrite Profiler software I use for colour calibration does not support HDR properly yet, but once they roll out HDR update I will this post a proper HDR ICM profile here. Calibrite promised proper HDR support by the end of this year. I haven't measured HDR brightness levels, but filling the screen with a white colour with +4 stops boost in Photoshop can be described as BRIGHT AF.\n\nBrightness control is not disabled when in HDR mode, which is great.\n\n# HDR Experience\n\nKOORUI S2741LM has four local dimming settings: High, Medium, Low and Off. Low and Off are completely unusable in HDR.\n\nHigh is most pleasant for most high quality HDR content like Blu-Ray movies and remuxes, as well as games with good HDR mastering like Senua 2. Low bitrate content suffers from compression artifacts which lead to crushed blacks and whites, and that results in high levels of blooming. It is better to use Medium setting for low quality HDR content.\n\nI have watched Paradise show which has a very poor colour grading. The only time when the bloom was really noticeable was in the second episode during the interrogation scene - for some reason show makers decided to put a protagonist in a very dark room and make his shirt brighter than the sun. I have no idea what is wrong with the people who made this show...\n\nI also watched Alita: Battle Angel (Blu-ray). It has much better grading and looks much better. Haven't noticed any blooming. The same can be said about Andor S1 (Blu-ray). Say what you want about Disney, but they sure do know how to master HDR! Andor looks like a candy!\n\nBut the biggest shock came from Planet Earth III (Blu-ray)! I compared it to an OLED and, my god, OLED is barely an SDR! Mini LED really shines in natural daylight scenes. That's when you can really enjoy the HDR and S2741LM can deliver insane brightness while maintaining excellent contrast, and it's a real viewing pleasure!\n\nAnd then there was another shock - DSLR photo mastering in HDR in Lightroom Classic. My camera can capture 14.6 stops according to DXO testing. SDR monitors can show 5-6 stops according to BBC engineers. Switching to HDR mastering is really mind-blowing! You can see so much more! Imagine a bright cloudy day. SDR preview shows you flat grey sky and dark trees. You switch to HDR mode, and suddenly you see loads of details in the clouds and shadow get lifted and more detailed too. If you are a photographer - you must switch to a mini LED yesterday!\n\n# Issues\n\nOverall I'm very happy with KOORUI S2741LM, but it's not perfect.\n\nFirst, it doesn't come with SDR and HDR profiles. That's a bummer. Especially since these monitors are calibrated at the factory, so HKC/KOORUI already have the profiles. Why don't they share them? Is it so hard to upload a 30kB file to your hosting?\n\nThen there is an issue that the monitor doesn't turn off its backlight when going into stand-by mode. It only turns off when you power down your PC. This is very annoying.\n\nThe USB hub is meh - USB 2.0 and only two USB A ports. Is it really so hard to make it USB 3.2 and add two USB C ports into the mix? I would gladly pay £100 more just to have a better hub.\n\nIt is also very hard to plug anything into any ports due to port layout. Thankfully, I don't plug cables that often.\n\nViewing angles are not the best. I always thought that the viewing angles were one of the main selling points of IPS panels and this is my only IPS monitor which changes brightness when viewed off angle. How? Why?\n\nS2741LM has very small bezels. It looks nice, but that feature has a downside - brightness fall off at the edges. It's not a big deal most of the time, but it is noticeable and annoying when you have white window in full screen. I would prefer to have thicker bezels with a more even backlight around the edges.\n\nLocal dimming in SDR mode is extremely conservative and tries extremely hard to avoid any blooming even at the highest setting. But it is unusable without a specific colour calibration as zones with low contrast (like light grey text on dark grey background) lose all the contrast (and text becomes nearly unreadable). I'm too lazy to create a special profile, so I keep local dimming off in SDR. Maybe some day... Or maybe KOORUI will read this review and will release colour profiles!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs I've already said, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. KOORUI S2741LM is great for general productivity, CAD work, graphical design, photo and video work. It is also a good gaming monitor and an excellent HDR display. It has some issues, but they're minor for me. Colour accuracy, text clarity and brightness are more important to me.\n\nIf you have any questions - I will be glad to answer them.",

I’ve seen a few high-end flat models (like the ASUS ROG Swift PG32UCDM and LG UltraGear 32GS95UE), and some curved OLEDs that are only 1440p or ultrawide, but not full 4K *and* curved *and* 240Hz.\n\nSo far, the only one that might fit all three specs is the **Gigabyte FO32U2P**, but I’m not sure if it’s actually curved or if that’s just marketing. Alienware’s 32\" 4K 240Hz QD-OLED also pops up in searches, but details on curvature are mixed. I need it mostly for Films, I might be willing to settle for a non curved if I cant find it but the black colour is also a big issue.\n\nHas anyone seen a *confirmed* curved black 4K OLED 240Hz model that’s actually released (not just announced)?  \nOr is it still something that’ll roll out next year?\n\nThanks in advance, I’d appreciate any real user experience or confirmed info!",

Nowadays we have plenty of good and reasonable priced gpus which can run 4K nicely (with upscaling) and modern console games looks great on 32\" 4K  (PS4, Xbox One X, PS5, Series X)\n\n1080p any refresh rate is the best for competitive responsive gaming without needing to sacrifice visuals if they matter, and with 24-27\" you get anyways decent picture for fast paced FPS games and again console games are also nice with smaller 1080p screens.\n\nSo these are my thoughts, in my case I have ditched 1440p for now, it was mistake at least in my experience.\nQHD is probably nice for productivity but...\nWhat you think about all this?",

Was not too confident with hydrogen peroxide, so got an ear camera cleaning tool by bebird, and honestly it is quite good to use.  \nThe scoop is silicone based so i dont feel much sceptical about it to not put in my ear... However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

The midrange is a little forward, and the treble has some peaks that I am very certain is down to the resin chamber.\n\nThis is purely a for fun project, not final as I plan to do stamped metal as the actual chamber for my closed back.

    "selftext": "That cord always ends up tangled in my pocket, a tiny knot of chaos I have to spend minutes undoing. My clumsy fingers wrestle with the plastic wire, while people with wireless earbuds would’ve already finished two songs by now. It’s been too long—its rubber coating has started to get sticky, the volume button on the controller feels jammed, and sometimes there’s a faint electric buzz in the right ear. Maybe it’s time to replace it.\n\nBut I just can’t quit that little click when I plug it into my phone.\nSo soft, yet so solid.\nLike the sound of an old door lock turning, shutting the whole world out.\n\nWalking is the worst. The wire swings across my chest, rustling against my jacket’s zipper. On the stairs I have to hold it tight, or it’ll catch on the railing. Windy days are even worse—the wire tangles in my hair and pulls hard enough to hurt. I still remember that rainy day when my best friend and I huddled under the convenience store awning. She naturally took off her right earbud and handed it to me:\n“Listen—this intro is amazing.”\nA raindrop slid down the wire into my collar, cold and sharp. We stood together in that shared ninety centimeters of space, and the warmth of her body seemed to flow through the copper line. For a moment, the rain really did feel like decoration.\n\nNow my friend wears thousand-yuan noise-cancelling headphones, walking with confidence, never worrying about tangled cords. She says technology is great—it’s freed us from the wire.\nBut I’m still using this glitchy old pair, the left side fine, the right side buzzing now and then—only working if I hold it at just the right angle. Like me, struggling in that night without an ending—broken, stuttering, unclear.\n\nYesterday on my way to class, the wire snagged on my backpack strap again. I crouched to untie the knot while the person behind me clicked their tongue in annoyance. But honestly, I kind of enjoy this clumsiness. Wireless feels too perfect—perfect like a lie. The spotless charging case, the precise touch controls, never tangled, never messy. But my life is a tangle—why should my music be perfectly ordered?\n\nThis wired earphone has been with me for nearly three years. The braided cable is pilling, the gold plating on the plug worn thin. These flaws are like folded corners in an old diary, recording every ordinary day. Of course a new pair would be better—sleek and shiny—but it doesn’t know my ears. It hasn’t heard the song I played on repeat after you left during that fight. It doesn’t know the white noise that lulled me to sleep on sleepless nights.\n\nLast month I almost replaced it. I even placed the order for the newest model—then canceled it at 3 a.m. The customer service agent asked if there was a problem with the product.\n“No,” I said. “The problem’s with me.”\n—Nostalgia is a sickness with no cure.\n\nToday, as the taxi climbed the overpass, the right ear suddenly went silent. I instinctively twisted the yellowed plug, feeling the rough edge of the tape under my fingers. The river below flowed calmly, and in my left ear Eason Chan was singing:\n‘The water knows well—it’s my duty to cherish the flowers.’\nThe music sounded thin, like a bird that had lost one wing.\nAnd still, I never replaced these earphones.\n\nThe right one is dead now. So be it. One side is enough.\nThis worn-out cord I clung to—\nin the end, it couldn’t keep the two worlds playing in sync.",

At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "title": "Burson Voyager Max + ModHouse Tungsten V1 DS | after 1,5 months",
    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

As a musician, that is very annoying.\n\nOn a more serious discussion, why do manufacturers feel the need to do this? Like I understand if your product is labeled, \"bass-boosted\".

    "selftext": "I noticed something interesting recently. I tried Float32 audio mode in Poweramp :\nAudio - Output settings - OpenSL ES output - Float 32 On - No DVC ON\n\nI decided to try it out to see if it really makes any difference in sound quality.\n\nHonestly, I wasn’t expecting much — I used the same earphones and the same phone as before, no hardware change at all. But once I switched to Float32, the sound quality clearly felt different.\n\nThe bass became smoother and more controlled, the transitions between instruments felt more natural, and even the vocals started standing out with more air and presence. Everything had a sense of space and depth that wasn’t there before.\n\nAfter reading up a bit, I found out that Float32 (32-bit floating point) audio gives the DAC more dynamic range and prevents clipping or distortion. So even though it doesn’t “boost” the sound, it processes it with more precision — which explains that clean and open feeling in the music.\n\nPretty cool to see how even a small thing like this can make a noticeable difference — and all that without changing a single piece of hardware! Thought I’d share this here since some of you might find it interesting too.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them.

The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’ve been experimenting with some EQ presets and wanted to share them for feedback and to see what you’ve all tried as well.\n\nFor this experiment, I used AutoEq's Custom Parametric Eq for the AZ100.\n\n**Custom 1** is **strictly the Harman target curve,** every band matches it as closely as possible.  \n**Custom 2** and **Custom 3** are my personal tweaks designed to make things a bit more fun and engaging while still staying grounded in the Harman philosophy.\n\nThe reason some numbers look a bit extreme is because **“flat” on these earbuds isn’t truly flat**, so Custom 1 compensates for that to accurately reflect Harman’s response.\n\n**Custom 1 (Strict Harman Reference):**  \n\\-9, -3, +3, 0, +2, 0, +2, -10\n\n**Custom 2 (+Bass):**  \n\\-3, -3, +3, 0, +2, 0, +2, -10\n\n**Custom 3 (++Bass):**  \n\\+1, -3, +3, 0, +1, +1, +2, -10\n\nCustom 2 boosts the bass for a fuller low end.  \nCustom 3 goes further, the **4 kHz and 8 kHz bands** are slightly adjusted to **compensate for the bass lift** so it still aligns with the Harman curve in the upper mids and treble region, no change needed to the 250hz range.\n\nCurious how these sound to others. I understand this is a subjective thing, but what EQs have you guys tried?",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI’m starting up a YouTube channel where I talk about Hi-Fi gear, but from the perspective of someone who mostly listens to bass-heavy music: hip-hop, R&B, reggaeton, metal, all the stuff that doesn’t usually get talked about much in the Hi-Fi space.\n\nI’m not asking for buying advice or comparisons, just looking to get some thoughts from people here about what kind of topics or angles would be cool to cover.\n\nI’ve got a few video ideas lined up already:\n\n1: Intro to the hobby : kind of an overview of what “Hi-Fi”actually is, why it’s fun even if your playlists are full of bass-heavy stuff, some common misconceptions, and how EQ can really help shape your sound. Also sort of some intro recs on how you can get a great setup for the same price you could wait a pair of ANC headphones or even less. \n\n2: Wireless ANC headphones: these are where most people start with higher-end gear, so I wanted to do something that talks about that whole category and how it fits into the hobby, especially for people who like tweaking sound profiles and are into bass heavy genres. \n\n3: Talking about my own gear: I’ve got a few headphones I love (HE1K Unveiled, Meze Empyrean 1) and thought it’d be fun to share what I like about them, how they respond to EQ, and how to get the sound you want out of your own setup.\n\nI think there’s room for more content that connects the “audiophile” side of things with the kind of music a lot of us listen to every day, but isn’t really represented in reviews or general talk of the hobby. Sort of give my thoughts on finding the perfect balance of a good thump in the bass, and a super clear rest of the song which just makes the music feel incredibly natural. If you’ve got ideas for what you’d want to see in that kind of channel, I’d love to hear them!\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to read, I’ll share the channel later once the first video’s up. Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT: one last thing, I speak Spanish fluently so I’m thinking of making a Spanish channel as well, if you’re here and speak Spanish and would like that lmk! Thanks! ",

    "selftext": "I was first drugged into using IEMs by a friend — that’s how it all started. I began with budget models like the Tangzu Wan’er, then moved up to the Truthear Hexa and Kefine Delci. I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

I wasn't really tampering with any part of it, but just keeping the speakers rotated flat in the case (required given that it's not the biggest case) which must have resulted in the plastic joint breaking off.

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

After 4–5 years of use, the battery isn’t as strong, and I’ve had to replace the pads twice. The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

That being said, the design wasn’t my favorite. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack location felt awkward, the rotation limiter that attaches on the side felt like an afterthought, and the driver cap, although unique, looked a little weird. \n\nTaking some not-so-subtle design cues from the Dahlia and Tungsten, this was my attempt to solve all those aesthetic issues. Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

This buzzing remains until I go to bed, but then goes away by the time I wake up.\n\nHowever, if I use the same headphones without the ANC on this does not happen.

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

Although I love the richer mids and better details from the arya stealth, I do like the sparkly highs from edition xs more. Makes vocal more exciting. I wonder which frequencies should I begin with to eq my arya stealth to have a bit more \"bites\" in the treble just like edition xs?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

The ones that I found don't have the 'lip' on the inside to lock the ear bud into the tip the way the stock ear tips do.\n\nDoes anyone know of a brand that makes triple flange silicone ear tips that won't slip off the T4? I know that's a bit of a specific question, but hopefully someone's had a similar issues and found a solution!\n\n[These are the tips that I'm currently using (size L). Sometimes I pull the earbud out and the tip stays in, which is very inconvenient.](https://www.amazon.com/ALXCD-Silicone-Replacementl-Connector-Earphone/dp/B0855SC86N?crid=1QZBG11UWQSU4&sprefix=alxcd%2Btriple%2Bflange%2Bear%2Btips%2C%2B6%2Bpairs%2Bs%2Fm%2Fl%2Bsizes%2Btriple%2Bthree%2Bflange%2Bnoise%2Bisolate%2Bsilicone%2Breplacementl%2Bcushion%2Bearbuds%2Btips%2Bwith%2B4mm%2Bconnector%2Bhole%2C%2Bfit%2Bfor%2Bmost%2Bin%2Bear%2Bearbuds%2C%2Bs%2Fm%2Fl%2Bwhite%2B%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-1&th=1)\n\nThanks!\n\nedit:corrected the link",

    "selftext": "DO NOT RECOMMEND OR PURCHASE!!\n\nThe Heavys H1H headphones, marketed for metal fans with an eight-driver design, promised durability and premium sound for $485. Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones’ headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden’s Run to the Hills. The app’s EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The “Hell Blocker” noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

Once I get that sorted, I will definitely measure them, but for now you are going to have to rely on my impressions.\n\nThe bass is not bad at all! It is tight, quick, and honestly fun. While it has a midbass peak somewhere, likely at 200hz which is common among closed backs, I very much do not dislike it! The midrange is a little forward, and the treble has some peaks that I am very certain is down to the resin chamber.\n\nThis is purely a for fun project, not final as I plan to do stamped metal as the actual chamber for my closed back. There is fog that generates inside the chambers which doesn't look pretty, but overall, I think looks very cool! Everything is hand assembled and designed by me.\n\nThe pads are Yaxi ST pads, the drivers are 40mm titanium speakers that I am currently working on with a manufacturer, and the resin chamber is made by facfox.",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them.

However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

I tried Float32 audio mode in Poweramp :\nAudio - Output settings - OpenSL ES output - Float 32 On - No DVC ON\n\nI decided to try it out to see if it really makes any difference in sound quality.\n\nHonestly, I wasn’t expecting much — I used the same earphones and the same phone as before, no hardware change at all. But once I switched to Float32, the sound quality clearly felt different.\n\nThe bass became smoother and more controlled, the transitions between instruments felt more natural, and even the vocals started standing out with more air and presence. Everything had a sense of space and depth that wasn’t there before.\n\nAfter reading up a bit, I found out that Float32 (32-bit floating point) audio gives the DAC more dynamic range and prevents clipping or distortion. So even though it doesn’t “boost” the sound, it processes it with more precision — which explains that clean and open feeling in the music.\n\nPretty cool to see how even a small thing like this can make a noticeable difference — and all that without changing a single piece of hardware!

The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "selftext": "That cord always ends up tangled in my pocket, a tiny knot of chaos I have to spend minutes undoing. My clumsy fingers wrestle with the plastic wire, while people with wireless earbuds would’ve already finished two songs by now. It’s been too long—its rubber coating has started to get sticky, the volume button on the controller feels jammed, and sometimes there’s a faint electric buzz in the right ear. Maybe it’s time to replace it.\n\nBut I just can’t quit that little click when I plug it into my phone.\nSo soft, yet so solid.\nLike the sound of an old door lock turning, shutting the whole world out.\n\nWalking is the worst. The wire swings across my chest, rustling against my jacket’s zipper. On the stairs I have to hold it tight, or it’ll catch on the railing. Windy days are even worse—the wire tangles in my hair and pulls hard enough to hurt. I still remember that rainy day when my best friend and I huddled under the convenience store awning. She naturally took off her right earbud and handed it to me:\n“Listen—this intro is amazing.”\nA raindrop slid down the wire into my collar, cold and sharp. We stood together in that shared ninety centimeters of space, and the warmth of her body seemed to flow through the copper line. For a moment, the rain really did feel like decoration.\n\nNow my friend wears thousand-yuan noise-cancelling headphones, walking with confidence, never worrying about tangled cords. She says technology is great—it’s freed us from the wire.\nBut I’m still using this glitchy old pair, the left side fine, the right side buzzing now and then—only working if I hold it at just the right angle. Like me, struggling in that night without an ending—broken, stuttering, unclear.\n\nYesterday on my way to class, the wire snagged on my backpack strap again. I crouched to untie the knot while the person behind me clicked their tongue in annoyance. But honestly, I kind of enjoy this clumsiness. Wireless feels too perfect—perfect like a lie. The spotless charging case, the precise touch controls, never tangled, never messy. But my life is a tangle—why should my music be perfectly ordered?\n\nThis wired earphone has been with me for nearly three years. The braided cable is pilling, the gold plating on the plug worn thin. These flaws are like folded corners in an old diary, recording every ordinary day. Of course a new pair would be better—sleek and shiny—but it doesn’t know my ears. It hasn’t heard the song I played on repeat after you left during that fight. It doesn’t know the white noise that lulled me to sleep on sleepless nights.\n\nLast month I almost replaced it. I even placed the order for the newest model—then canceled it at 3 a.m. The customer service agent asked if there was a problem with the product.\n“No,” I said. “The problem’s with me.”\n—Nostalgia is a sickness with no cure.\n\nToday, as the taxi climbed the overpass, the right ear suddenly went silent. I instinctively twisted the yellowed plug, feeling the rough edge of the tape under my fingers. The river below flowed calmly, and in my left ear Eason Chan was singing:\n‘The water knows well—it’s my duty to cherish the flowers.’\nThe music sounded thin, like a bird that had lost one wing.\nAnd still, I never replaced these earphones.\n\nThe right one is dead now. So be it. One side is enough.\nThis worn-out cord I clung to—\nin the end, it couldn’t keep the two worlds playing in sync.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI’m starting up a YouTube channel where I talk about Hi-Fi gear, but from the perspective of someone who mostly listens to bass-heavy music: hip-hop, R&B, reggaeton, metal, all the stuff that doesn’t usually get talked about much in the Hi-Fi space.\n\nI’m not asking for buying advice or comparisons, just looking to get some thoughts from people here about what kind of topics or angles would be cool to cover.\n\nI’ve got a few video ideas lined up already:\n\n1: Intro to the hobby : kind of an overview of what “Hi-Fi”actually is, why it’s fun even if your playlists are full of bass-heavy stuff, some common misconceptions, and how EQ can really help shape your sound. Also sort of some intro recs on how you can get a great setup for the same price you could wait a pair of ANC headphones or even less. \n\n2: Wireless ANC headphones: these are where most people start with higher-end gear, so I wanted to do something that talks about that whole category and how it fits into the hobby, especially for people who like tweaking sound profiles and are into bass heavy genres. \n\n3: Talking about my own gear: I’ve got a few headphones I love (HE1K Unveiled, Meze Empyrean 1) and thought it’d be fun to share what I like about them, how they respond to EQ, and how to get the sound you want out of your own setup.\n\nI think there’s room for more content that connects the “audiophile” side of things with the kind of music a lot of us listen to every day, but isn’t really represented in reviews or general talk of the hobby. Sort of give my thoughts on finding the perfect balance of a good thump in the bass, and a super clear rest of the song which just makes the music feel incredibly natural. If you’ve got ideas for what you’d want to see in that kind of channel, I’d love to hear them!\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to read, I’ll share the channel later once the first video’s up. Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT: one last thing, I speak Spanish fluently so I’m thinking of making a Spanish channel as well, if you’re here and speak Spanish and would like that lmk! Thanks! ",

I wasn't really tampering with any part of it, but just keeping the speakers rotated flat in the case (required given that it's not the biggest case) which must have resulted in the plastic joint breaking off.

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

Once I get that sorted, I will definitely measure them, but for now you are going to have to rely on my impressions.\n\nThe bass is not bad at all! It is tight, quick, and honestly fun. While it has a midbass peak somewhere, likely at 200hz which is common among closed backs, I very much do not dislike it! The midrange is a little forward, and the treble has some peaks that I am very certain is down to the resin chamber.\n\nThis is purely a for fun project, not final as I plan to do stamped metal as the actual chamber for my closed back. There is fog that generates inside the chambers which doesn't look pretty, but overall, I think looks very cool! Everything is hand assembled and designed by me.\n\nThe pads are Yaxi ST pads, the drivers are 40mm titanium speakers that I am currently working on with a manufacturer, and the resin chamber is made by facfox.",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them.

At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

Im going to check these two out this friday. The asking price of the focals 500$ and the shures 275$. The shures definitely look just out of the box. So just curious if 500$ is reasonable for the focals (they do come with spare un used ear pads). ",

    "selftext": "I was first drugged into using IEMs by a friend — that’s how it all started. I began with budget models like the Tangzu Wan’er, then moved up to the Truthear Hexa and Kefine Delci. I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

I'm the classic \"buy all these games on steam\" so my catalog is extensive.

I’m not really in it for the graphics, but they are nice to have as high as I could get them if possible.

It will stick to 30 FPS most of the time, but can regularly drop quickly to 28 FPS, with some bigger drops and stutters when entering and leaving buildings and towns.\n\nI also tested Lossless Scaling, which works to some degree, with some parts of the game feeling very smooth with no input lag using 2X, but go into cities and we have some big slowdowns that just feel awful. I personally don't recommend using it, but it does work to some degree, so I can understand the reasoning to try it out.\n\nYou can check out more details in our written or video impressions about performance!\n\n[Written](https://steamdeckhq.com/news/the-outer-worlds-2-is-just-barely-playable-on-the-steam-deck-first-impressions/)\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9czTJtLflpI)",

    "selftext": "**Initial Problem**: Steam Client would not update (in neither Game or Desktop mode) and kept saying there was an \"Update Error... try again later\".\n\n(Sorry for the novella but I figured more detail is better for troubleshooting)\n\nI rebooted the Deck as well as disconnected/reconnected to my WiFi network to see if that would help. It didn't. Due to reasons I'll explain later, I suspect it might have something to do with the WiFi connection and could've possibly been remedied by docking and using a wired connection from the beginning.\n\nI looked around online to see if others experienced/fixed this issue, when I stumbled on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSUyzUT1pzI). **I wish I never had**. The video *does* show the exact error I was having. It suggested going into Desktop Mode and running `sudo steamos-reboot --reboot-other`.\n\nI know... I KNOW. Why would I blindly run a sudo command without reading comments first (of which there are many that have my same regrets)? It was late, I was tired, video seemed legit, and I honestly think there may be cases where this did work for some people. In any case, this what happened next and where I'm at...\n\nAfter running that command, it took a very long time as it attempted to reboot and then it loaded into the initial setup wizard as if this was a new machine (uh oh). I proceeded through the setup until it got to the \"Installing...\" stage where it attempts to update stuff. This also kept failing with a similar error to the original one I had, but now I was stuck in that stage and couldn't boot fully. What I tried:\n\n* I tried restarting, I tried hard shutdowns when it got stuck at times, but every time I ended up at the stage in the wizard with the same error.\n* I next tried doing a Power + QAM (...) button restart, which supposedly lets you choose a prior working state. It offered four options:\n   * Current B\n   * <some long identifier I can't remember>\n   * Current B + boot menu\n   * <same identifier> + boot menu\n* I first tried the second option (presumably \"Previous\")... no difference. I then tried the Current option... still no difference. I may have even tried one of the boot menu options, can't remember, but it didn't help.\n* I started panicking and found some more threads that suggested I try to use the BIOS (Power + Vol Up) and boot from an EFI file. This didn't seem to work either (same outcome).\n* The same set of threads pointed to Steam's official docs that recommend flashing a SteamOS boot drive and use the \"Repair SteamOS\" option, which to my understanding reinstalls a lot of the OS components but attempts to preserve your user info and customizations. So I did that...\n   * It did seem to do *something* because the boot animation changed to (I think) the stock version, but it then dropped me back into the same setup wizard... which then failed at the same point of updating!\n\nI started to suspect something was wrong with the WiFi connection (even though it reported connecting fine). So I docked it, plugged in an ethernet connection, and holy hell it actually started progressing through that stuck update process.\n\nNow, I have what appears to be a \"fresh\" install (not the lightweight repair outcome I thought I would get). I don't have any of the previously installed games, store rewards, settings/customizations, etc. I bought the Deck new two weeks ago and spent a *lot* of time dialing it in to my preferences (Decky plugins, the whole lot). This all seems gone now.\n\nI woke up today with the realization that if I did lose everything I should probably just do a clean wipe to ensure nothing was left over... when I got a small glimmer of hope. In the Storage settings, the drive seems to still have \\~112GB of data somewhere on the drive that the current install doesn't own (see pic).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lg4o07qr8vwf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5ce4a00f2d4e3ecf1085f6839a4c4d755d30cef\n\nCould that be my previous state? Is it possible to get into the guts and somehow restore this? I'm a software engineer so I feel quite comfortable at the command line and whatnot. TIA, y'all.",

Screen brightness of course will go to max, but are there other processor power settings I can change?\n\nAnd yes, I know the batteries are replaceable and I may at some point do it, but the whole \"melting the glue\" or peeling it out of the unit doesn't sound like something I want to do right now.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "As a quick preamble - I've been rocking this combination for a couple of years now, on my Windows machine and it's worked fine.\n\nAfter having recently refreshed the system and reinstalled Windows, I can no longer get the custom resolutions defined in Moondeck to work. What I expect is that when I start the stream my desktop resolution is changed to the Custom Resolution defined in Moondeck, and then back the original once the stream ends.\n\nWhat happens instead is that I'm stuck with my original desktop resolution for the duration of the stream.\n\nWhat I've already checked:\n\n1. The custom resolution is present in Nvidia Control Panel (it is). 1680x1050@60\n2. The resolution is also configured on the Deck in the Moonlight client. Even though I don't recall having to do this step when I previously had it working.\n3. Moonlight client has the \"Optimise game configuration for streaming\" ticked.\n4. Moondeck is set to use custom resolutions, and the values are correctly configured.\n5. I've looked at the Sunshine logs and while I see the client passing refresh value over to the server, I can't see it trying to pass the resolution.\n\nI'm kind of stumped and open to suggestions on what to look at next.\n\nEdit - SOLUTION:\n\nAs suggested, I went with Apollo instead of Sunshine and it's working as expected. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who's finding resolution switching on Sunshine finicky.",

The power led kept blinking. So for that's how it is currently. Any advice moving forward? Is my deck screwed?\n\nDoes anyone else has issue with the deck turn on while in the case?

    "selftext": "I just replaced mine with these. I've tried ElecGear's TMR, GuliKit's Hall effect, and HandheldDIY's Hall effect joysticks for the Steam Deck OLED, and these are the best, hands down.\n\n\n\nCircularity: ElecGear > HandheldDIY > GuliKit\n\n* Circularity is just as good as HandheldDIY's, and both are better than GuliKit's square outer dead zone.\n\n\n\nCentring: ElecGear > GuliKit > HandheldDIY\n\n* Where it reigns supreme is the centring. It is better than GuliKit's, which is better than HandheldDIY's. When pushing the stick and letting go completely it WILL return to the dead centre. Though, it is NOT perfect when pushing the stick and slowly guiding it back to the centre—the Deck will still register the stick as being the tiniest bit pressed, I'm talking within pixels of the centre, and it'll jitter a few pixels.\n\n\n\nCalibration: ElecGear > HandheldDIY > GuliKit\n\n* This video shows how you can flick the joystick to move the dot around, which is, without a doubt, the easiest way to get pixel perfect accuracy during calibration. HandheldDIY's calibration is fine, not as accurate or relaxed as ElecGear's, but a far cry from GuliKit's atrocious method. Go watch Steam Deck Guy's video [GuliKit Joysticks for Steam Deck Review](https://youtu.be/-N6oKOqUvfM?si=Wl15gSPtXHg0WNRL&t=325) and skip to 5:25. The similar K button on the the back of GuliKit's PCB is tinier than a rat's asshole, and is impossible to press with tweezers simultaneously with L3/R3.\n\n\n\nAll in all, this is the only option that should be considered. Now if you'll excuse me, I lost a screw for the back shell and now I have to crawl through a tumbleweed of my own pubes.",

    "selftext": "I found this out through using the SteamgridDB Decky plugin, Steam supports animated coverart and it looks amazing on the Steamdeck...but there is a catch. \n\nThe Steamdeck only has enough processing power to display a set number of animated art before it starts to run into optimisation issues. In other words, if you have multiple collections set up and you try to go to the collections tab you'll find the UI starts to slow down for a short while as it tries to display all of the animated artwork in the collection thumbnails. This also happens on the home screen but it's not as bad as it is on the collection screen.\n\nNow this isn't really a huge issue as nobody needs to have animated artwork, but at the same time I personally think it'd be nice if Steam added an optimisation setting that lets you pause the animated artwork on selected menus. I'd have it set so that animated artwork only shows up outside of the collections tab but also inside the collection folders themselves as those are the only areas where the lag is brief and not much of a hindrance.

I decided to finish what I started and resume my save (which has mods, like CET, etc.).

However, as soon as I got into a car, I cannot accelerate/decelerate. As soon as I hit the right trigger, I enter vehicular combat mode and start firing off shots.\n\nAs soon as I checked my settings I saw the image attached (I tried changing to another layout, but regardless of what I choose, this remained persistent).\n\nI cannot figure out what the hell is going on and what is breaking with the controller layouts and the keybinds. If I hit right trigger in the menus, they work, but as soon as I enter a car, it doesn’t.\n\nMy keybinds in game are the default controller settings, which is fine and expected, but cannot understand what is breaking here.\n\nAny help would be sincerely appreciated.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI did remove `--launcher-skip` parameter I had (the only parameter I had) to launch the game from the launcher, which resulted in my settings being \"corrupt\" and reset to the defaults.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! With The Outer Worlds 2 releasing soon, we got a chance to check it out ahead of its launch and test it on the Steam Deck. I am surprised to say that it is playable, though has some major caveats. It will stick to 30 FPS most of the time, but can regularly drop quickly to 28 FPS, with some bigger drops and stutters when entering and leaving buildings and towns.\n\nI also tested Lossless Scaling, which works to some degree, with some parts of the game feeling very smooth with no input lag using 2X, but go into cities and we have some big slowdowns that just feel awful. I personally don't recommend using it, but it does work to some degree, so I can understand the reasoning to try it out.\n\nYou can check out more details in our written or video impressions about performance!\n\n[Written](https://steamdeckhq.com/news/the-outer-worlds-2-is-just-barely-playable-on-the-steam-deck-first-impressions/)\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9czTJtLflpI)",

I feel like I cannot physically make it, I cannot push through the pain, if I could end it tomorrow I would because I don't see anything worth fighting for, I just feel done. \n\nSo once again, I thank you all for your help, your attention, your support. The reason I fight on is for my family, but it's always for the family I've made here, but as I say, it's becoming too hard. \n\nAdd me on steam, I don't know how often, or whether I will be on, but I will try - 82871772\n\nI am on my discord a little more, you can find me there but again, none of you had to do anything, it's just been nice having you all around. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/X54M525Nq\n\nBeing stuck in bed the past few weeks means, wanting to play games my steam deck either can't or doesn't play well. \n\nSTREAMING! It's honestly such a way forward, wether it's Xbox cloud, moonlight or or Nvidia (I use Nvidia Ge Force and Xbox Cloud) \n\nIt delivers well, I get to play BF6 at 60fps on my deck or Silent Hill F, games with the anti cheat I can now play, it's super helpful. \n\nA little review :\n\nHalloween is my favourite time of year, my second behind Christmas.\n\nRavenous Devils - Heard of Sweeny Todd? Well it's basically that, you manage a Victorian pie shop downstairs and tailor upstairs. It's pretty much a simple click and do this, people come to see the tailor, you kill them drop them down to your wife who grinds the up and makes pies and Steaks. \n\nYou make money, make your system and equipment better and don't get caught! It's fun! \n\nI love games where YOU are the villain. And for 3.99 it's a solid great game that I had never come across before! \n\nThe Drifter - A point and click adventure I came along, you're a \"Drifter\" a homeless guy, an Aussie in Australia dealing with homeless people going missing in the night. \n\nIt's nothing new regarding the mechanics, but simply the story and VOICE ACTING it's phenomenal and again, whilst being cheap, it's scary in a real life kind of way. It's perfect for the deck and just great for when moving a few fingers is the least painful thing to do! \n\nThanks for reading (Apologises for the depressing part) \n\nLove you all. \n\nM\n\n\n P.S. Drop me message on here if you want to talk to ask anything! \n\n",

    "title": "Steam Client wouldn't update, so I tried to fix it and \"oops, might've lost everything\". Please help 🙏🏼️",
    "selftext": "**Initial Problem**: Steam Client would not update (in neither Game or Desktop mode) and kept saying there was an \"Update Error... try again later\".\n\n(Sorry for the novella but I figured more detail is better for troubleshooting)\n\nI rebooted the Deck as well as disconnected/reconnected to my WiFi network to see if that would help. It didn't. Due to reasons I'll explain later, I suspect it might have something to do with the WiFi connection and could've possibly been remedied by docking and using a wired connection from the beginning.\n\nI looked around online to see if others experienced/fixed this issue, when I stumbled on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSUyzUT1pzI). **I wish I never had**. The video *does* show the exact error I was having. It suggested going into Desktop Mode and running `sudo steamos-reboot --reboot-other`.\n\nI know... I KNOW. Why would I blindly run a sudo command without reading comments first (of which there are many that have my same regrets)? It was late, I was tired, video seemed legit, and I honestly think there may be cases where this did work for some people. In any case, this what happened next and where I'm at...\n\nAfter running that command, it took a very long time as it attempted to reboot and then it loaded into the initial setup wizard as if this was a new machine (uh oh). I proceeded through the setup until it got to the \"Installing...\" stage where it attempts to update stuff. This also kept failing with a similar error to the original one I had, but now I was stuck in that stage and couldn't boot fully. What I tried:\n\n* I tried restarting, I tried hard shutdowns when it got stuck at times, but every time I ended up at the stage in the wizard with the same error.\n* I next tried doing a Power + QAM (...) button restart, which supposedly lets you choose a prior working state. It offered four options:\n   * Current B\n   * <some long identifier I can't remember>\n   * Current B + boot menu\n   * <same identifier> + boot menu\n* I first tried the second option (presumably \"Previous\")... no difference. I then tried the Current option... still no difference. I may have even tried one of the boot menu options, can't remember, but it didn't help.\n* I started panicking and found some more threads that suggested I try to use the BIOS (Power + Vol Up) and boot from an EFI file. This didn't seem to work either (same outcome).\n* The same set of threads pointed to Steam's official docs that recommend flashing a SteamOS boot drive and use the \"Repair SteamOS\" option, which to my understanding reinstalls a lot of the OS components but attempts to preserve your user info and customizations. So I did that...\n   * It did seem to do *something* because the boot animation changed to (I think) the stock version, but it then dropped me back into the same setup wizard... which then failed at the same point of updating!\n\nI started to suspect something was wrong with the WiFi connection (even though it reported connecting fine). So I docked it, plugged in an ethernet connection, and holy hell it actually started progressing through that stuck update process.\n\nNow, I have what appears to be a \"fresh\" install (not the lightweight repair outcome I thought I would get). I don't have any of the previously installed games, store rewards, settings/customizations, etc. I bought the Deck new two weeks ago and spent a *lot* of time dialing it in to my preferences (Decky plugins, the whole lot). This all seems gone now.\n\nI woke up today with the realization that if I did lose everything I should probably just do a clean wipe to ensure nothing was left over... when I got a small glimmer of hope. In the Storage settings, the drive seems to still have \\~112GB of data somewhere on the drive that the current install doesn't own (see pic).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lg4o07qr8vwf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5ce4a00f2d4e3ecf1085f6839a4c4d755d30cef\n\nCould that be my previous state? Is it possible to get into the guts and somehow restore this? I'm a software engineer so I feel quite comfortable at the command line and whatnot. TIA, y'all.",

I have a Nintendo switch right now but the catalog is limited and having to buy $40-60 worth of a game each time isn't exactly something I'm fond of. I really love the idea of playing majority of my steam games on the go (hades 2, megabonk, seen I can play some nice AAA titles fairly too). I'm the classic \"buy all these games on steam\" so my catalog is extensive. But I also don't want to just blindly nod and say \"I should get this\" if there's other alternative that better suit my wants. Heck if even getting a steam deck is as worth it with me having a switch. Open to all suggestions on how to go about this. \n\nTL;DR\nWant a steam deck, which one do I get?

Playable with very quiet to no sound. BG3 or Sea of Stars (which I’m enjoying while NOT listening to audiobooks right now, won’t work, as I can’t follow the story while following the story of an audiobook.",

What I expect is that when I start the stream my desktop resolution is changed to the Custom Resolution defined in Moondeck, and then back the original once the stream ends.\n\nWhat happens instead is that I'm stuck with my original desktop resolution for the duration of the stream.\n\nWhat I've already checked:\n\n1. The custom resolution is present in Nvidia Control Panel (it is). 1680x1050@60\n2. The resolution is also configured on the Deck in the Moonlight client. Even though I don't recall having to do this step when I previously had it working.\n3. Moonlight client has the \"Optimise game configuration for streaming\" ticked.\n4. Moondeck is set to use custom resolutions, and the values are correctly configured.\n5. I've looked at the Sunshine logs and while I see the client passing refresh value over to the server, I can't see it trying to pass the resolution.\n\nI'm kind of stumped and open to suggestions on what to look at next.\n\nEdit - SOLUTION:\n\nAs suggested, I went with Apollo instead of Sunshine and it's working as expected. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who's finding resolution switching on Sunshine finicky.",

I am surprised to say that it is playable, though has some major caveats. It will stick to 30 FPS most of the time, but can regularly drop quickly to 28 FPS, with some bigger drops and stutters when entering and leaving buildings and towns.\n\nI also tested Lossless Scaling, which works to some degree, with some parts of the game feeling very smooth with no input lag using 2X, but go into cities and we have some big slowdowns that just feel awful. I personally don't recommend using it, but it does work to some degree, so I can understand the reasoning to try it out.\n\nYou can check out more details in our written or video impressions about performance!\n\n[Written](https://steamdeckhq.com/news/the-outer-worlds-2-is-just-barely-playable-on-the-steam-deck-first-impressions/)\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9czTJtLflpI)",

I feel like I cannot physically make it, I cannot push through the pain, if I could end it tomorrow I would because I don't see anything worth fighting for, I just feel done. \n\nSo once again, I thank you all for your help, your attention, your support. The reason I fight on is for my family, but it's always for the family I've made here, but as I say, it's becoming too hard. \n\nAdd me on steam, I don't know how often, or whether I will be on, but I will try - 82871772\n\nI am on my discord a little more, you can find me there but again, none of you had to do anything, it's just been nice having you all around. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/X54M525Nq\n\nBeing stuck in bed the past few weeks means, wanting to play games my steam deck either can't or doesn't play well. \n\nSTREAMING! It's honestly such a way forward, wether it's Xbox cloud, moonlight or or Nvidia (I use Nvidia Ge Force and Xbox Cloud) \n\nIt delivers well, I get to play BF6 at 60fps on my deck or Silent Hill F, games with the anti cheat I can now play, it's super helpful. \n\nA little review :\n\nHalloween is my favourite time of year, my second behind Christmas.\n\nRavenous Devils - Heard of Sweeny Todd? Well it's basically that, you manage a Victorian pie shop downstairs and tailor upstairs. It's pretty much a simple click and do this, people come to see the tailor, you kill them drop them down to your wife who grinds the up and makes pies and Steaks. \n\nYou make money, make your system and equipment better and don't get caught! It's fun! \n\nI love games where YOU are the villain. And for 3.99 it's a solid great game that I had never come across before! \n\nThe Drifter - A point and click adventure I came along, you're a \"Drifter\" a homeless guy, an Aussie in Australia dealing with homeless people going missing in the night. \n\nIt's nothing new regarding the mechanics, but simply the story and VOICE ACTING it's phenomenal and again, whilst being cheap, it's scary in a real life kind of way. It's perfect for the deck and just great for when moving a few fingers is the least painful thing to do! \n\nThanks for reading (Apologises for the depressing part) \n\nLove you all. \n\nM\n\n\n P.S. Drop me message on here if you want to talk to ask anything! \n\n",

    "title": "Steam Client wouldn't update, so I tried to fix it and \"oops, might've lost everything\". Please help 🙏🏼️",
    "selftext": "**Initial Problem**: Steam Client would not update (in neither Game or Desktop mode) and kept saying there was an \"Update Error... try again later\".\n\n(Sorry for the novella but I figured more detail is better for troubleshooting)\n\nI rebooted the Deck as well as disconnected/reconnected to my WiFi network to see if that would help. It didn't. Due to reasons I'll explain later, I suspect it might have something to do with the WiFi connection and could've possibly been remedied by docking and using a wired connection from the beginning.\n\nI looked around online to see if others experienced/fixed this issue, when I stumbled on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSUyzUT1pzI). **I wish I never had**. The video *does* show the exact error I was having. It suggested going into Desktop Mode and running `sudo steamos-reboot --reboot-other`.\n\nI know... I KNOW. Why would I blindly run a sudo command without reading comments first (of which there are many that have my same regrets)? It was late, I was tired, video seemed legit, and I honestly think there may be cases where this did work for some people. In any case, this what happened next and where I'm at...\n\nAfter running that command, it took a very long time as it attempted to reboot and then it loaded into the initial setup wizard as if this was a new machine (uh oh). I proceeded through the setup until it got to the \"Installing...\" stage where it attempts to update stuff. This also kept failing with a similar error to the original one I had, but now I was stuck in that stage and couldn't boot fully. What I tried:\n\n* I tried restarting, I tried hard shutdowns when it got stuck at times, but every time I ended up at the stage in the wizard with the same error.\n* I next tried doing a Power + QAM (...) button restart, which supposedly lets you choose a prior working state. It offered four options:\n   * Current B\n   * <some long identifier I can't remember>\n   * Current B + boot menu\n   * <same identifier> + boot menu\n* I first tried the second option (presumably \"Previous\")... no difference. I then tried the Current option... still no difference. I may have even tried one of the boot menu options, can't remember, but it didn't help.\n* I started panicking and found some more threads that suggested I try to use the BIOS (Power + Vol Up) and boot from an EFI file. This didn't seem to work either (same outcome).\n* The same set of threads pointed to Steam's official docs that recommend flashing a SteamOS boot drive and use the \"Repair SteamOS\" option, which to my understanding reinstalls a lot of the OS components but attempts to preserve your user info and customizations. So I did that...\n   * It did seem to do *something* because the boot animation changed to (I think) the stock version, but it then dropped me back into the same setup wizard... which then failed at the same point of updating!\n\nI started to suspect something was wrong with the WiFi connection (even though it reported connecting fine). So I docked it, plugged in an ethernet connection, and holy hell it actually started progressing through that stuck update process.\n\nNow, I have what appears to be a \"fresh\" install (not the lightweight repair outcome I thought I would get). I don't have any of the previously installed games, store rewards, settings/customizations, etc. I bought the Deck new two weeks ago and spent a *lot* of time dialing it in to my preferences (Decky plugins, the whole lot). This all seems gone now.\n\nI woke up today with the realization that if I did lose everything I should probably just do a clean wipe to ensure nothing was left over... when I got a small glimmer of hope. In the Storage settings, the drive seems to still have \\~112GB of data somewhere on the drive that the current install doesn't own (see pic).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lg4o07qr8vwf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5ce4a00f2d4e3ecf1085f6839a4c4d755d30cef\n\nCould that be my previous state? Is it possible to get into the guts and somehow restore this? I'm a software engineer so I feel quite comfortable at the command line and whatnot. TIA, y'all.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup?

    "selftext": "Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. Our small team is getting ready to launch a smart digital calendar (syncs seamlessly with your Google/Apple Calendar, shows your agenda, to-dos, and weather).\n\nWe're trying to build something that truly puts users first, which is why we're committing to two core principles that we think this community will appreciate:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠​​Lifetime Warranty:​​ If it breaks, we fix it or replace it. No planned obsolescence.\n2.\t⁠⁠​​No Subscription Fees:​​ All core features (syncing, etc.) are included in a one-time price. No monthly fees ever.\n\nWe believe this is a pretty strong value proposition, but we need your honest opinions to get the pricing right. We're not a giant corporation, so your feedback will directly influence our final decision.\n\n​​We'd love to know:​\n\nWhat do you think is a fair one-time price?​​ Considering the hardware and our promise of lifelong support. \n\nHow much does the \"Lifetime Warranty\" influence your perceived value?​​ Does it make you more confident in buying? \n\nHow big of a dealbreaker are subscription fees for a productivity tool like this?​ \n\nAny general thoughts or questions?​​ \n\nWe're all ears.\n\nThis isn't a stealth ad – we genuinely want to build a product you'd want to buy.

    "title": "Reverse-engineering DPS 101 on LEDVANCE Tuya RGBIC lamp - unknown LED indices cause device reboot",
    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I read online that I need to consider the total wattage that the dimmer will support (e.g. if  I have two strings connected together I would need a dimmer that can support: 60 bulbs x 7 watts each bulb= total 420 watts) and that it's compatible with the listed 31 voltage, right?

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees.

This is how I did it years ago (lived in this house for 18 years) before I had a hub and devices, but I was always annoyed that eventually the internal battery would die and the clock and schedule would get messed up after a power outage.\n\nI'm looking for a similar device that has WiFi capability, only really needed for the purpose of setting the clock from an NTP server after power outage.  Otherwise, I would prefer the device not depend on the cloud for scheduling, etc...\n\nAny suggestions?",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather). The fingerprint access is the reason I bought them at the time, and it rarely works (even when I reprogram the lock, it forgets my prints in a week or two). I will not buy another Utec and when I searched the group that's what people recommended.  \nWe are looking for a deadbolt replacement lock (no handle / knob needed) that has fingerprint and bluetooth (no wifi).

I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

    "title": "Turn ESP32 devices into through-wall motion sensors",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "title": "Reverse-engineering DPS 101 on LEDVANCE Tuya RGBIC lamp - unknown LED indices cause device reboot",
    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

(and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

    "selftext": "UK based and house with no neutrals. \n\nSo currently I have a 1 gang light switch which is permentantly on so that I can control the Tapo smart bulb via voice or HA. However, I was wondering (I don't mind purchasing equipment) if it's possible to replace the dumb 1 gang and replace with a smart 2 gang. The 1st light switch would activate the ceiling light (which I would change to a dumb bulb) unless of course there's a smart switch and bulb that work together but my understanding is there isn't?\n\nThe 2nd switch would activate the under counter LED strip (Yet to install). \n\nIs something like this possible at all?",

    "selftext": "Christmas post… thinking about it already! I’m looking for a compact smart plug that sits between an outlet and a device. When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

What if someone hacks the cameral, etc.\n\nI initially thought it was a joke, but I found the product on the Kohler site ([Dekoda - Tracker & Waste Analyzer](https://www.kohlerhealth.com/dekoda/)) and apparently this is a serious piece of equipment; it's not cheap either at $600.\n\nI love home automation with my full Ubiquiti setup including cameras, WiFi switches, outlets, locks, etc., but I don't think I am ready to install a \"poo cam\".",

My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

    "title": "Reverse-engineering DPS 101 on LEDVANCE Tuya RGBIC lamp - unknown LED indices cause device reboot",
    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

    "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking to add some automation to my home for the very first time. I am looking to start by purchasing a smart lock for my front door. I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup?

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m a student at the University of Central Florida, and my classmates and I are taking an Engineering Entrepreneurship course where we’re developing a startup idea — a **smart safe** that makes protecting valuables simpler, smarter, and more secure.\n\nAs part of our project, we’re interviewing people who **own a safe, have owned one in the past, or are interested in getting one**. We’re just trying to learn what people like, what’s frustrating, and what features they wish safes had.\n\nThe chat would be super casual — about **10–15 minutes** — and there are no right or wrong answers. We’re just gathering honest feedback to help shape our idea.\n\nIf you’d be open to chatting, please comment below or DM me!\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to read this — we really appreciate it!",

    "selftext": "Hi\nAt the moment we are building our new home and i am searching for the perfect solution to set up our Smart Home. \n\nI played a bit with HomeAssistant and I really like that really everything is possible to realise with it. (Some things are more comokicated but with enough time i can handle it) So i would love to have the visualisation over HA. \n\nBUT; What would be the best/easiest way to set up the rest/electricity? This should be more of an easy/straight forward thing. Should run when we move into the house. I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system. (Where I can do the normal stuff already when moving into the house)\n\nThanks for your advice!\n",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

I’d like to replace the system with a fingerprint reader instead. I know it’s not the most secure option, but honestly, having a remote lying around in the driveway isn’t great either.\n\nI’m looking for a simple, weather-resistant (lots of rain) fingerprint reader that can be managed directly on the device, via a web interface, or through an app. Ideally, it should also integrate with Home Assistant.\n\nThere are a lot of Chinese models on the market, but it’s hard to tell which ones are reliable. I’ve looked into Anviz. The P7 is still available locally but seems to be EOL, and the C2 Slim appears to be out of stock everywhere.\n\nDoes anyone have other suggestions or recommendations for specific models?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

I have two in my bedroom and have wanted to automate these with the rest of my set up for a really long time now, however I'm broke and can't afford to shell out $150 for something like this:  \n[https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP](https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Blind-Tilt-Motorized-Blinds/dp/B0BMLFZ4CP)\n\npersonally it makes 0 sense to me that a motor that rotates a blind would cost this much. Any suggestions that are more cost effective, or potentially anyone willing to sell something similar at a cheaper price? I'll still happily quote something fair. Not sure whether this is something I should take up my first DIY project on",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

It and my front sprinkler controls randomly lose power when, for some reason, the GFCI randomly trips. This is a recurring thing every few months, not daily/weekly.  \n\nWould love a simple small WiFi plug that I can plug into that outlet, and if there is a power loss, my Alexa would tell me it’s no longer on the network. This is outdoor but mostly safe from the elements, but something that ideally fits in the weatherproof outlet cover would be ideal. \n\nThx for any suggestions.",

I have been using water sensors with Samsung Smart Things but, even with the zigbee protocol the devices go offline frequently and don’t create the mesh I was looking to create. \n\nSo I found the YoLink starter kit on Amazon. Has anyone had any experiences with these sensors and hub ? They are using LoRa to provide connectivity. And use AAA batteries not the lithium ones the Samsung sensors require. \n\nI also am using Google home and have downloaded the app. And it is integrated. I just need to buy the devices. Any reviews from anyone using these in their home ? \n\nLink provided in case you’re are curious. Amazon has this kit for $10.00 less than the manufacturer \n\nThis YoLink starter kit includes a hub and 4 water leak sensors that provide SMS, email, and push notifications to help prevent water damage. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/ehedlNH\n\n",

Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working.

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

(Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I dont really care what the time increment is. I just wanna be able to set it to dim on at x time and dim off at x time. I have cruised youtube and the google and have not found what I'm lookin for yet, i dont think. So i figured id come to the ole reddit and see if what I'm looking for even exists and if anyone has specific products they would suggest. ",

Any suggestions?\n\nI’ve read quite a few reviews saying Aqara can be hit-or-miss in smart setups (lag, stability, hub quirks). I’m open to solid alternatives available in Europe (EU versions). Please share your picks.  \n  \nLooking for a reliable setup with low latency and stable performance over time.\n\nThanks!",

I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5.

    "selftext": "I feel like i've taken crazy pills going down this rabbit hole of smart bulbs. I ordered Innr Zigbee bulbs not realizing that I need a hub for them. So now, I'm doing some belated research and found I probably wanted wi-fi bulbs, so no hub is needed. What I'm finding though is that sometimes wi-fi bulbs don't work so great if the connection is not stable. I have Starlink, so I have very very few issues with connectivity.   \nDo I need a hub for my set up? or if I do need one, what's a decent basic hub to control 5 or 6 bulbs in a small (1400sq ft) house? I don't want a voice activated system like Alexa or Google Home. Something more simple. What are your suggestions? I'm not trying to create some massive home network here.    \nOverthinking here!  ",

We’re just trying to learn what people like, what’s frustrating, and what features they wish safes had.\n\nThe chat would be super casual — about **10–15 minutes** — and there are no right or wrong answers. We’re just gathering honest feedback to help shape our idea.\n\nIf you’d be open to chatting, please comment below or DM me!\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to read this — we really appreciate it!",

(Some things are more comokicated but with enough time i can handle it) So i would love to have the visualisation over HA. \n\nBUT; What would be the best/easiest way to set up the rest/electricity? This should be more of an easy/straight forward thing. Should run when we move into the house. I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

Now, whenever I boot my PC, I see two little CMD windows pop up and disappear quickly.\n\nThere’s only one contributor to the repo (“phillip hamnett”), and the client has 9 jobs posted but 0 hires. I’ve since deleted the repo, but now my mouse sometimes jumps or gets stuck in a corner.\n\nCould this repo have installed something malicious on my PC?  \nAny suggestions on how to check or clean my system properly would be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance I’m a dev and this situation has me a bit paranoid.",

After an hour of it not turning on i did a hard reset on the pc by holding down the shut off button for 15 seconds and turning it on a minute later but nothing had changed.\n\nAfter 2 days i was about to open the pc case but decided to give it another chance to see if it worked and to my surprise it did, although it didnt turn on normally I was prompted with this message \"The previous overclock settings have failed, system has been restored to it's default settings.

However, if the MacBook was connected via Ethernet, speeds reached 950 Mbps (as expected).\n\nWhen performing a transfer from the Internet (for example, via WeTransfer), I get the expected speeds of **950 Mbps**.\n\nI should also mention that these speeds on the MacBook and iPad were measured over Wi-Fi (**802.11ax \\~950 Mbps Tx Rate**).\n\nI have already reinstalled the OS, checked the disk, and even performed a factory reset on the devices.\n\nOn the MacBook, I have also tried using a different user account, disabled **AWDL** (Apple Wireless Direct Link), and turned off location services and Bluetooth.\n\nBoth devices were purchased recently and have been in use for about a week.\n\nWould love to test some recommendations and thank you in advance",

Connecting the KTC through either HDMI or DP-USB-c leads to the same effect.\n* It's not about the DP-USB-C cable on the ASUS. I've tested swapping the DP-USB-C cables and the result was the same.\n* It's not about the Dock. The effect is the same on the TB4 dock or using the computer's dedicated ports.\n* None of this is an issue on my other Macbook, an M1 Max.\n\nMy current intuition is that somehow the KTC is \"faster\" at doing the handshake regardless of the protocol, and my M4 Pro somehow is shutting the recognition window for the slower monitor. And somehow this is an issue for Pro video cards and not for Max ones, regardless of age.\n\nIs there a way to fix this? Is the culprit the old ASUS monitor?\n\nChatGPT suggests I use an EDID emulator to delay the HPD of the KTC monitor. Does that make sense?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hello! My PC is not turning on, no reaction in the case itself when I press the power button. However, some connected devices that have lights are rhythmically flickering for a fraction of a second every 2 seconds, at the same time. Like mic flashes green, drawing tablet’s circle is halfway lit when it happens (it looks dull purple but at full power working it’s bright blue); as far as I remember, while both devices are connected to a pc that is not on, they shouldn’t light up at all.\n\nIt was working several hours ago, but when I returned home it’s like that. To be honest, I already had similar issues when I left home for several days and turned electricity at my place off, after being back on it sometimes needed to be left for some time or plugged in/out a couple of times before it turned on. The last time it happened was more than 2 months ago, and it was working fine since then. Games were running fine, photoshop was doing fine (bc god knows it sometimes acts like it needs more brainpower to just exist with one pic open then playing cyberpunk), connected devices working without trouble.\n\nKnowing that, I already tried checking how well power cable is in, disconnecting from power source for several minutes before connecting back, moving pc to a different socket where it’s the only device that is powered, letting it sit for half an hour without trying to turn it on after, unplugging everything but necessities (m&k+screen), all of the above in different combinations. The only life within the case that I’ve seen was 1 time after disconnecting from power source, waiting, connecting back, some part of it flickered for a tiny bit when I tried to press the button (if I caught it correctly, it was motherboard’s side part where the ports are, but I can be mistaken).\n\nWriting here in case that description points to something obvious that I could change myself, bc I have friends who had really bad history with tech companies in my country (like saying something is wrong with several pricey parts so they can earn more money on selling said parts, and then it turned out that they didn’t actually change some of them). Or, well, at least I will be aware what parts could be causing the problem and which obviously aren’t.\n\nI’m not from US, going to sleep now, sorry if I don’t answer in time. Part of me still hopes that after sitting a night out it will be back to life (just in case, anything I can check myself with software or smth if it does come back to the world of living?). Thank you anyway, honestly appreciate it already if you made it to the end of my rumbling😅",

Is the battery malfunctioning? Is the DC jock the main problem? I am getting pretty desperate since I have a lot of documents there that are unfinished and need to turn in within the next week, does anyone have any idea on what could be the cause?\n\nIf it helps, the laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15. The laptop itself recognizes when turning on that there's a problem and it's not charging properly.\n\nI would really appreciate some advice, thanks.",

    "title": "ROG Strid G614JI Display and Fan Issues",
    "selftext": "BACKGROUND: Hello! Not sure if this is the right subreddit for a question like this (if not please let me know what would be more suitable!) I've had this G614JI for a year now, I bought it used on OfferUp. Just for some background, it came with a bad liquid metal application, so I replaced that, later down the road had to replace it again, went ahead and just cleaned it completely and applied thermal grease (temps before this incident were pretty good, maxing out at 80 I believe). Anyways, I recently got a new laptop and wanted to sell this one, but the palm rest had paint that was chipping and the screen had this spot where light was bleeding too much. I purchased a palm rest off eBay, replaced it, but the keyboard didn't fit properly. I sent that back and got a new one with the keyboard already installed, replaced it on my laptop and now it looks brand new. I also got a brand new screen off eBay, but it ended up having only 66% sRGB coverage, so I'll be returning that as well and buying an OEM. \n\nISSUES: My issues arise when actually turning on the laptop, the CPU fan will ramp up and get super loud. I also checked GHelper and it said my GPU fan was at 0 RPM, no matter what. I tried turning graphics hybrid, iGPU only, and discrete only, and it persists. I've uninstalled GHelper, tried going back to Armoury Crate, then completely uninstalled that and went back to GHelper, tried updating windows, tried downgrading the BIOS (which I couldn't do because apparently BIOS 331 locks you into it). I even swapped the GPU and CPU fan and the CPU fan, now connected to the GPU header, turned on and spun just as loud, so it is not an issue with the fans itself. Additionally, the GPU fan itself IS spinning, as I've opened it while it was running, but another note is that even though it is spinning, it is not pushing as much air as the CPU fan. I checked if it was possibly a bent pin, but it looks straight to me (I couldn't get a picture of this since its very small.) I've also tried to EC reset multiple times and even completely disconnected the battery. Another issue that I believe is separate is that when I'm playing a game in Standard (iGPU + DGPU), the screen will flash black and the DGPU usage will spike. It only occurs during Standard, if I play using Discrete only or iGPU only I have no issues. I also noted that if I launch a game on battery, this issue won't occur, but if it is plugged in, it happens. Running with only the DGPU also yields similar performance before I was having any of these issues, so I don't think its overheating or thermal throttling. \n\nI want to try and fix this myself so that I don't have to spend even more just to sell this laptop. The warranty on it has also expired so I don't have that option. Please let me know what could possibly cause these issues because I don't know what else to attempt. Thank you!\n\n\n(Just realized I am unable to add pictures as it is greyed out, I'll try to make an imgur link or let me know how to upload pics, thanks!)",

On the top the is a small sheet-like pin that was also easy to pull towards the middle. The problem comes when I try to bend back the last pin. It is again a sheet-like metal, stuck to the wall, and it has a hole in to it towards the top, but it seems intentional as the hole is a perfect circle. The weird thing is that when I open in the device and apply the smallest amount of pressure with a needle to the small metal part that pokes out while listening to a song the song starts to sound perfect but when I stop some of the music sounds like I'm in a tunnel/muddy and something I can't hear the lyrics. Is there any way to bend that pin back/fix the port.",

You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. At least one detected problem appears to be network related. In case you are using a WLAN adapter, try disabling it to get better results. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup.

Background processes are not a factor. It has crashed with the DAW being the only thing opened. The DAW I use is Tracktion Waveform. ",

    "selftext": "# Story / Context:\n\nSo, funny story… I was trying to play Fortnite with some friends. My phone’s internet is fast (90+ Mbps), while my home network is slow (4–9 Mbps). But i normally use home Wi-Fi for the stable latency over fast speeds, but I also needed to plug my phone to transfer some files from my phone.\n\nBy habit, I enabled USB tethering without realizing it. Then Fortnite had a huge update, and to my surprise, the download speeds were way higher than my my home network can provide —well after checking, it was coming from my phone.\n\nThen it hit me: my tablet was still working perfectly as an extra monitor with SuperDisplay even though i was using my phones internet! 🤯\n\nI spent the next bit connecting and disconnecting everything, experimenting like a mad scientist… and after some trial and error, I came up with a repeatable workflow that works every single time.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Verified Solution (Steps):\n\n**1️⃣ Optional: Give USB tethering priority (recommended for stability)**\n\n* Connect your phone via USB tethering once and set that connection to **high priority** in Windows network settings (adapter metric).\n* After this, Windows will remember to prefer your phone’s internet when connected.\n\n**2️⃣ Disconnect the phone.**\n\n**3️⃣ Connect your PC to your home network**\n\n* Use **Ethernet** if possible, it is recommended (or Wi-Fi) if your PC/Laptop cannot support Ethernet, but i am not sure if it will work smoothly via WiFi. This keeps the local network active for your devices.\n\n**4️⃣ Connect your phone/tablet to the same Wi-Fi network** as your PC.\n\n* This ensures the SuperDisplay app can see your tablet.\n\n**5️⃣ Reconnect your phone to your PC via USB tethering.**\n\n**6️⃣ Launch SuperDisplay (or your preferred second-screen app that requires internet connection).**\n\n✅ Result:\n\n* Your PC uses your **phone’s faster internet**.\n* Your tablet/phone remains visible on the **local network**, so SuperDisplay keeps running **smoothly**.\n* Even very old tablets (like a Lenovo with 2 GB RAM) run **perfectly**, including responsive touch.\n\n  \nWhy it works\n\nThink of it like **signal flow in AV**:\n\n* **Ethernet** = “video/control signal path” (local LAN).\n* **USB tether** = “internet/data feed” (WAN).\n* Windows routes **internet traffic through USB** but keeps the **local network alive**, so your SuperDisplay connection stays intact.\n\nBasically, you’re running a **dual-path network signal** — one for the app, one for the internet\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* Connect PC to Ethernet + tablet/phone to Wi-Fi → then USB tether your phone → launch SuperDisplay.\n* Old tablets work fine.\n* Happy accident turned into a permanent fix. 😄",

    "selftext": "A few days ago, there was a windows 11 update that applied as I restarted my dell Inspiron 13 laptop. I booted it after the update and started working, but every ~6 minutes after booting, the laptop's screen would freeze on whatever screen it was on (lockscreen, desktop, applications, etc), and would only start working again after a hard reset via the power button.\n\nI tried restarting graphics drivers via the keyboard shortcut but this did nothing while the laptop was frozen.\n\nI then decided to reimage the laptop, just via the reset settings within windows, no usb media tool. The laptop froze on the desktop as the reset settings window was saying smth akin to 'preparing to reset: %60.'\n\nAfter that, the laptop wont boot. Pressing the power button turns on and off the keyboard backlight very responsively, but holding the power button does nothing except, again turn on the keyboard backlight. I have a USB Boot drive plugged in.\n\nI've tried unplugging the battery and trying again but this changes nothing.\n\n\nAny ideas on what the underlying problem is based on these symptoms? Thanks in advance!\n",

My game crashed with a error saying something about an driver timeout or something like that.

I tried running amds automatic Installer but I got the Error 173 no graphics hardware detected. I had this same problem yesterday where I got the error 182 which means a unsupported amd gpu is installed. I could fix this when I downloaded the latest windows update. The gpu itself is also completetly undetected in the task manager and the device manager says unknown device and gives the error 28 no drivers installed. The error is shown on every pci device (dont have any other pci devices only the gpu). I tried uninstalling the device and restarted multiples times (didnt work) and when I try to download any drivers from device manager it says that no drivers were found. Reinstalling the gpu and checking the pcie cables on the gpu itself and on the psu also didnt work. The gpu itself gives a small white light for a short moment when starting and the small rgb strip on it works too plus the fans are spinning to it isnt completely dead.",

    "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI need some advice ASAP. Here’s what happened:\n\nAbout a month ago in the school computer lab, my friend tried to borrow my flash drive and noticed there was a **Counter-Strike 1.6** file on it. I remembered that the flash drive did have the CS 1.6 file, so since we were done with our tasks, we just **transferred the CS 1.6 files to the PC** to play. We didn’t actually install anything  not even Windows Defender blocked it  we just copied the files and played.\n\nNow, recently, the IT staff said that the PC broke because of the CS 1.6 file. I’m willing to pay if necessary, but I feel like this might **not actually be the reason** the PC broke, and I need to defend myself.\n\nSome extra details:\n\n* The file was transferred to a **Windows 11 PC, i9 11th gen, 8GB RAM**, so I don’t think it’s a performance issue.\n* A few of my friends also transferred it to about 5 other PCs they haven’t broken yet.\n* We were **expected to pay for any PC that breaks**, but what if the reason the PC broke **wasn’t actually influenced by the CS 1.6 file**? I’m worried about being held responsible unfairly.\n* The CS 1.6 file was downloaded from [**csdownload.net**](https://csdownload.net).\n* I already tried contacting [**promocs@gmail.com**](), but no response.\n\nSo, I’m asking: **Can anyone help me verify if this Counter-Strike 1.6 file is actually safe, or could it really have caused the PC to break?** I really need help understanding this before I face any consequences.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

I'm at a loss how to debug this. I tried switching RAM to other sockets(2x16GB), taking out CMOS battery for a few seconds and putting it back on, using hybrid mode on/off for power unit but nothing really helps.

However, if the MacBook was connected via Ethernet, speeds reached 950 Mbps (as expected).\n\nWhen performing a transfer from the Internet (for example, via WeTransfer), I get the expected speeds of **950 Mbps**.\n\nI should also mention that these speeds on the MacBook and iPad were measured over Wi-Fi (**802.11ax \\~950 Mbps Tx Rate**).\n\nI have already reinstalled the OS, checked the disk, and even performed a factory reset on the devices.\n\nOn the MacBook, I have also tried using a different user account, disabled **AWDL** (Apple Wireless Direct Link), and turned off location services and Bluetooth.\n\nBoth devices were purchased recently and have been in use for about a week.\n\nWould love to test some recommendations and thank you in advance",

Connecting the KTC through either HDMI or DP-USB-c leads to the same effect.\n* It's not about the DP-USB-C cable on the ASUS. I've tested swapping the DP-USB-C cables and the result was the same.\n* It's not about the Dock. The effect is the same on the TB4 dock or using the computer's dedicated ports.\n* None of this is an issue on my other Macbook, an M1 Max.\n\nMy current intuition is that somehow the KTC is \"faster\" at doing the handshake regardless of the protocol, and my M4 Pro somehow is shutting the recognition window for the slower monitor. And somehow this is an issue for Pro video cards and not for Max ones, regardless of age.\n\nIs there a way to fix this? Is the culprit the old ASUS monitor?\n\nChatGPT suggests I use an EDID emulator to delay the HPD of the KTC monitor. Does that make sense?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hello! My PC is not turning on, no reaction in the case itself when I press the power button. However, some connected devices that have lights are rhythmically flickering for a fraction of a second every 2 seconds, at the same time. Like mic flashes green, drawing tablet’s circle is halfway lit when it happens (it looks dull purple but at full power working it’s bright blue); as far as I remember, while both devices are connected to a pc that is not on, they shouldn’t light up at all.\n\nIt was working several hours ago, but when I returned home it’s like that. To be honest, I already had similar issues when I left home for several days and turned electricity at my place off, after being back on it sometimes needed to be left for some time or plugged in/out a couple of times before it turned on. The last time it happened was more than 2 months ago, and it was working fine since then. Games were running fine, photoshop was doing fine (bc god knows it sometimes acts like it needs more brainpower to just exist with one pic open then playing cyberpunk), connected devices working without trouble.\n\nKnowing that, I already tried checking how well power cable is in, disconnecting from power source for several minutes before connecting back, moving pc to a different socket where it’s the only device that is powered, letting it sit for half an hour without trying to turn it on after, unplugging everything but necessities (m&k+screen), all of the above in different combinations. The only life within the case that I’ve seen was 1 time after disconnecting from power source, waiting, connecting back, some part of it flickered for a tiny bit when I tried to press the button (if I caught it correctly, it was motherboard’s side part where the ports are, but I can be mistaken).\n\nWriting here in case that description points to something obvious that I could change myself, bc I have friends who had really bad history with tech companies in my country (like saying something is wrong with several pricey parts so they can earn more money on selling said parts, and then it turned out that they didn’t actually change some of them). Or, well, at least I will be aware what parts could be causing the problem and which obviously aren’t.\n\nI’m not from US, going to sleep now, sorry if I don’t answer in time. Part of me still hopes that after sitting a night out it will be back to life (just in case, anything I can check myself with software or smth if it does come back to the world of living?). Thank you anyway, honestly appreciate it already if you made it to the end of my rumbling😅",

    "selftext": "BACKGROUND: Hello! Not sure if this is the right subreddit for a question like this (if not please let me know what would be more suitable!) I've had this G614JI for a year now, I bought it used on OfferUp. Just for some background, it came with a bad liquid metal application, so I replaced that, later down the road had to replace it again, went ahead and just cleaned it completely and applied thermal grease (temps before this incident were pretty good, maxing out at 80 I believe). Anyways, I recently got a new laptop and wanted to sell this one, but the palm rest had paint that was chipping and the screen had this spot where light was bleeding too much. I purchased a palm rest off eBay, replaced it, but the keyboard didn't fit properly. I sent that back and got a new one with the keyboard already installed, replaced it on my laptop and now it looks brand new. I also got a brand new screen off eBay, but it ended up having only 66% sRGB coverage, so I'll be returning that as well and buying an OEM. \n\nISSUES: My issues arise when actually turning on the laptop, the CPU fan will ramp up and get super loud. I also checked GHelper and it said my GPU fan was at 0 RPM, no matter what. I tried turning graphics hybrid, iGPU only, and discrete only, and it persists. I've uninstalled GHelper, tried going back to Armoury Crate, then completely uninstalled that and went back to GHelper, tried updating windows, tried downgrading the BIOS (which I couldn't do because apparently BIOS 331 locks you into it). I even swapped the GPU and CPU fan and the CPU fan, now connected to the GPU header, turned on and spun just as loud, so it is not an issue with the fans itself. Additionally, the GPU fan itself IS spinning, as I've opened it while it was running, but another note is that even though it is spinning, it is not pushing as much air as the CPU fan. I checked if it was possibly a bent pin, but it looks straight to me (I couldn't get a picture of this since its very small.) I've also tried to EC reset multiple times and even completely disconnected the battery. Another issue that I believe is separate is that when I'm playing a game in Standard (iGPU + DGPU), the screen will flash black and the DGPU usage will spike. It only occurs during Standard, if I play using Discrete only or iGPU only I have no issues. I also noted that if I launch a game on battery, this issue won't occur, but if it is plugged in, it happens. Running with only the DGPU also yields similar performance before I was having any of these issues, so I don't think its overheating or thermal throttling. \n\nI want to try and fix this myself so that I don't have to spend even more just to sell this laptop. The warranty on it has also expired so I don't have that option. Please let me know what could possibly cause these issues because I don't know what else to attempt. Thank you!\n\n\n(Just realized I am unable to add pictures as it is greyed out, I'll try to make an imgur link or let me know how to upload pics, thanks!)",

    "selftext": "I am trying to revive an old mp3 player. Currently the only issue that I have is that the jack doesn't work. When I look into it on the right I see a pin that kind of look like one of those small springs in electronics that are used for opening and closing doors. It was easy to pull towards the middle. On the top the is a small sheet-like pin that was also easy to pull towards the middle. The problem comes when I try to bend back the last pin. It is again a sheet-like metal, stuck to the wall, and it has a hole in to it towards the top, but it seems intentional as the hole is a perfect circle. The weird thing is that when I open in the device and apply the smallest amount of pressure with a needle to the small metal part that pokes out while listening to a song the song starts to sound perfect but when I stop some of the music sounds like I'm in a tunnel/muddy and something I can't hear the lyrics. Is there any way to bend that pin back/fix the port.",

You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. At least one detected problem appears to be network related. In case you are using a WLAN adapter, try disabling it to get better results. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup.

When it boots it works perfectly but to boot it is a struggle.  \n\n\nThe issue is also only cold boot, rebooting always works fine.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been having a really weird problem with Windows 11.\n\nWhenever I install a fresh copy of Windows 11, it activates automatically. But after a couple of days, things start to go wrong — when I open the Activation page in Settings, it freezes, and some programs like *MSI Afterburner* stop working properly.\n\nWhen I run `sfc /scannow`, it says there are corrupt files that it can’t fix. Then I try `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`, but it always gets stuck at **62.3%** and never finishes.\n\nI even tried wiping the drive completely and reinstalling a clean Windows image, but the exact same issue comes back every time.\n\nDoes anyone know what could be causing this or how to fix it? Any help would be really appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance ",
