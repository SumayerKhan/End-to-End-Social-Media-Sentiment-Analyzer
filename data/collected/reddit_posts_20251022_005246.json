They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7’s most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> • **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> • **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> • **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> • **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3–4× higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time — yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple’s iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism — effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it’s a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn’t support 240 MHz channels — but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple’s iPhones simply don’t take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple’s documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> • [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> • [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> • [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> • [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> • [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> • [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> • [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> • [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> • [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> • [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> • [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> • [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard. Apple’s current implementation delivers **minimal improvement over Wi-Fi 6/6E**.  \n>  \n> **If you’d like to see full Wi-Fi 7 features enabled on Apple devices, submit feedback via Safari:**  \n\n1. Type *AppleFeedback://* in the address bar and press Enter  \n2. Press **New Feedback**  \n3. Tap **iOS & iPadOS**  \n4. Enter *iPhone Wi-Fi 7 features* as the title  \n5. Select **Wi-Fi** under *“What area are you seeing this issue?”*  \n6. Choose **Suggestion** under *“What type of feedback are you reporting?”*  \n7. In *Details*, write: *Please enable MLMR MLO, 4096-QAM, and 320 MHz channel width support.*  \n\n> For the remaining fields, fill them out as you prefer and submit the feedback request.  \n>  \n> **Thank you!**",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

The DMA, enacted in 2023, aims to regulate the power of large tech companies and has also faced criticism from the US.",

    "title": "Design theory - blur the edges",
    "selftext": "I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 to an Air and I was nervous that the formula for the Air (small battery, less camera, etc.) was going to create product that simply wouldn’t be commercial. With all the press around the launch  I was almost scared off from buying the Air since it was dismissed as a big mis-step for Apple in the vein of Apple Intelligence. Being an Apple fan boy since my first iPod, I’ve always considered that any product I buy from Apple is going to be one of the best products I’ve ever purchased. I was concerned that the Air simply couldn’t live up to this expectation especially for the price. But how wrong I was! A month into using my new phone, it’s quite simply the best piece of hardware I’ve owned, and here’s why:\n\nThe highlights of the experience are mainly in the fluidity of IOS26 paired with the promotion display, the phone flies compared to my 12. My interactions with the phone are way more engaging and natural, stack on Dynamic Island and all of the intrigue from the transparency effects in this OS - i basically just want to stare at it even if i have nothing to really do on it. \n\nWhich brings me to my main point which is: Apple is still at the forefront of hardware and software integration. Despite all the hot air around AI and how abysmal Siri really is, Apple has really doubled down on unifying the software and hardware to the point that using a button feels like touching the software, touching the hardware feels like touching the OS directly. As a consumer I find that very compelling. If a product is so well considered that the form of the hardware is indistinguishable from the software it really opens up a new tech experience which I think is worth more than AI functionality. \n\nI notice the considerations for the hardware on the Air, thinness being the biggest, and I greatly enjoy the design direction it conveys: make the tech invisible so that the experience feels like magic. I think that’s always been a focal point for apple’s brand and why the Air feels like the first return to the Jobs era of product design for the iPhone lineup in a long time. A product that blurs the edges between digital space and the physical world (without a headset) will get my money every time. ",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI really need some help or advice here.\n\nMy iPhone’s cellular stopped working right after updating to iOS 26. I ran Apple Diagnostics and it clearly said hardware issue. Even the authorized Apple Service Center in my city (India) confirmed something was wrong, so they sent my phone to Apple under warranty.\n\nBut now Apple has sent my phone back saying “No Trouble Found.” The weird part? My warranty was valid till October 5, but they dispatched my phone back on October 1 and now that I’ve received it, the warranty has expired. The phone started working fine but again since yesterday the same issue.\n\nI updated to iOS 26.0.1, which Apple themselves say fixes “some users may be unable to connect to a cellular network after updating to iOS 26”  but my issue still persists.\n\nSo… what do I even do now? \nDo I have any chance of Apple fixing this under warranty since I reported and sent it before expiry? Has anyone else faced this cellular issue after iOS 26 / 26.0.1?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would really help.🙏",

Sure, if they stole 10, they would get 1000 ig, but I am also just a tad bit hopeful that they might try to it sell it from a second hand website or so, so very slight chance but, maybe the naive buyer would be able contact me.\n\nCould anyone, who has/ had this experience enlighten me a bit, especially about my chances of getting it back?\n\nThanks so much already!",

    "title": "My top 4 gimbal recommendations for 2025 for iPhone (tried them all so you don’t have to)",
    "selftext": "Just finished using my last one for a couple of days with iPhone 16 pro max (Hohem isteady v3 ultra) and I figured it’s time to post my quick rundown of the best gimbals to consider in 2025. Been testing these over the last few months so here’s a quick take on what each one’s good at, who it’s for and how they compare in price/performance.  \n  \n1. Hohem isteady v3 ultra is priced around $170 and feels like Hohem really leaned into the AI and remote-control side of things. The standout feature is the detachable AI tracker with its own little camera and fill light plus a remote touchscreen that gives you a live feed. You can literally control the gimbal remotely, watching yourself from a distance while recording (perfect if you film alone). It can also add the sub-screen remote control feature. Not only can you view your composition through the exclusive touch remote but you can also scan the QR code with another device in the hohem joy app’s camera to start remote access, making filming effortless, without the need to purchase an Apple watch. It’s light to carry around and even includes an extension rod and tripod legs built in for creative low or high angle shots. If you’re a solo creator or vlogger who needs something compact with reliable subject tracking and within reasonable price, this one might be exactly what you need.  \n  \n2. DJI osmo mobile 7P uses their new Activetrack 7.0 which is noticeably smoother than last year’s version. The 7P model includes a modular attachment that combines a fill light and microphone input which is great if you’re trying to streamline your mobile filming setup. Build quality feels premium and the app integration is also great. It’s an easy recommendation for anyone who values reliable tracking and straightforward functionality over experimental add-ons. Price wise the 7P sits around $125 - $150 on different sites.  \n  \n3. Insta360 flow 2 Pro is a clever update to last year’s flow line. It's more compact, folds neatly and introduces deep track 4.0 which offers improved multi-person tracking and intelligent subject switching. You can also control it remotely using an Apple watch or a second phone but the smartphone functionality may require additional setup. It’s great for travel vloggers, casual creators or anyone who wants solid stabilization without lugging around something bulky. It is priced around $160.  \n  \n4. GoPro fluid pro AI gimbal is designed to handle not just smartphones but also GoPros. It has impressive AI-driven tracking, a built-in fill light and can run up to 18 hours. It doubles as a power bank which makes it really appealing. It’s priced around $230, making it the priciest on this list but you’re paying for flexibility and endurance. It’s not something I’d recommend for casual users or daily vlogging though looking for cost effective gear.  \n  \nAll of these were released in 2025 and it has been a surprisingly strong year for gimbals especially considering how well they go with iPhones. No bad picks this time, just choose based on your style and how much gear you’re willing to carry.",

The PITAKA one looks perfect but I can’t find it anywhere in the EU, and the Alogic Matrix+ is way out of my budget.\n\nThe Mous one looks high-quality and safe, but I’m not sure because im not sure if its weight to much or can fit in his pocket, and he is not going to use the 3 daily. The SwanScout one looks good on paper but I’m not sure if it’s reliable or just another rebranded product.\n\nDoes anyone know any verified, good-quality brand (Anker level or similar) that makes something detachable like PITAKA — or has personally tested one that doesn’t overheat or damage the battery? Because battery health and good quality things are important for him\n\nI’m in France, so I’d prefer something that ships to the EU\n\nThanks in advance! 💗",

But moved to an iPhone 13 in May 2023, and the signal has been *ok*. \n\nI've heard conflicting things about the iPhone 17 Pro. Some say the antenna placement is better, resulting in consistently stronger signal (but they don't specify region or carrier). And others have complained that they experience bad signal strength with their 17 Pro.\n\nIf there is some evidence from users here that the 17 Pro does provide a legitimate signal upgrade on Verizon over the 13, I'd consider upgrading.

This morning when I woke up after putting my phone on the charger to charge last night, I cannot get into my phone as it's stuck on a black screen that has a picture on a laptop and a charger, prompting me to connect my phone to a computer to \"restore\" it. I tried doing this, but then realized I can't do this because I have a chromebook and can't download itunes. My iphone keeps making the sound an iphone makes when it's turning on, and the apple logo keeps coming on and off. I cannot turn it on manually as my lock button doesn't work either. I brought my phone to the apple store today and they want to charge me $700 to fix the phone, it would be $100 if I had apple care. Anyway, i'm wondering if this has happened to anyone. I'm also wondering if it's possible to have a family member or friend who has apple care, to help me fix my phone. Can i use their account?",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

I’ve been an iPhone user since the original was released in 2007, typically upgrading every 1-2 years, and I’ve never had second thoughts about a purchase. However, the battery life on the air is just not enough for me. \n\nI’m typically taking the phone off charger around 6am, and while sometimes I have some juice left when I go to bed around 11pm or so, many times it’s on low battery mode, or I have to top it off. I wouldn’t consider myself a power user, but I use my phone consistently throughout the day. The battery is at 100% capacity, and it’s struggling to keep up with my needs. It’s hard to imagine what it would be like at 90% capacity. \n\nWhen I couple the battery issues with the camera deficiencies and the single speaker, I’m left regretting my purchase. I do make calls on speaker sometimes, and the single speaker can make it hard to hear the person on the other end. I do like the form factor, and that is why I gave it a shot, but to have dramatically better battery/camera/speaker for only $100 more with the pro, I will be returning my air and purchasing the pro. I will miss having a lighter phone, but the tradeoffs on performance are simply not worth it. ",

    "selftext": "I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 to an Air and I was nervous that the formula for the Air (small battery, less camera, etc.) was going to create product that simply wouldn’t be commercial. With all the press around the launch  I was almost scared off from buying the Air since it was dismissed as a big mis-step for Apple in the vein of Apple Intelligence. Being an Apple fan boy since my first iPod, I’ve always considered that any product I buy from Apple is going to be one of the best products I’ve ever purchased. I was concerned that the Air simply couldn’t live up to this expectation especially for the price. But how wrong I was! A month into using my new phone, it’s quite simply the best piece of hardware I’ve owned, and here’s why:\n\nThe highlights of the experience are mainly in the fluidity of IOS26 paired with the promotion display, the phone flies compared to my 12. My interactions with the phone are way more engaging and natural, stack on Dynamic Island and all of the intrigue from the transparency effects in this OS - i basically just want to stare at it even if i have nothing to really do on it. \n\nWhich brings me to my main point which is: Apple is still at the forefront of hardware and software integration. Despite all the hot air around AI and how abysmal Siri really is, Apple has really doubled down on unifying the software and hardware to the point that using a button feels like touching the software, touching the hardware feels like touching the OS directly. As a consumer I find that very compelling. If a product is so well considered that the form of the hardware is indistinguishable from the software it really opens up a new tech experience which I think is worth more than AI functionality. \n\nI notice the considerations for the hardware on the Air, thinness being the biggest, and I greatly enjoy the design direction it conveys: make the tech invisible so that the experience feels like magic. I think that’s always been a focal point for apple’s brand and why the Air feels like the first return to the Jobs era of product design for the iPhone lineup in a long time. A product that blurs the edges between digital space and the physical world (without a headset) will get my money every time. ",

This morning again went to go look at the time and no response, and just a few minutes ago again went to go hang up the call and the screen was black. Could this be a design flaw? Could it be the screen protector messing with the screen? Or just the hit on the floor messed up everything? \n\nEither way I’m heading to the Apple Store later but wanted to get some opinions",

    "title": "My top 4 gimbal recommendations for 2025 for iPhone (tried them all so you don’t have to)",
    "selftext": "Just finished using my last one for a couple of days with iPhone 16 pro max (Hohem isteady v3 ultra) and I figured it’s time to post my quick rundown of the best gimbals to consider in 2025. Been testing these over the last few months so here’s a quick take on what each one’s good at, who it’s for and how they compare in price/performance.  \n  \n1. Hohem isteady v3 ultra is priced around $170 and feels like Hohem really leaned into the AI and remote-control side of things. The standout feature is the detachable AI tracker with its own little camera and fill light plus a remote touchscreen that gives you a live feed. You can literally control the gimbal remotely, watching yourself from a distance while recording (perfect if you film alone). It can also add the sub-screen remote control feature. Not only can you view your composition through the exclusive touch remote but you can also scan the QR code with another device in the hohem joy app’s camera to start remote access, making filming effortless, without the need to purchase an Apple watch. It’s light to carry around and even includes an extension rod and tripod legs built in for creative low or high angle shots. If you’re a solo creator or vlogger who needs something compact with reliable subject tracking and within reasonable price, this one might be exactly what you need.  \n  \n2. DJI osmo mobile 7P uses their new Activetrack 7.0 which is noticeably smoother than last year’s version. The 7P model includes a modular attachment that combines a fill light and microphone input which is great if you’re trying to streamline your mobile filming setup. Build quality feels premium and the app integration is also great. It’s an easy recommendation for anyone who values reliable tracking and straightforward functionality over experimental add-ons. Price wise the 7P sits around $125 - $150 on different sites.  \n  \n3. Insta360 flow 2 Pro is a clever update to last year’s flow line. It's more compact, folds neatly and introduces deep track 4.0 which offers improved multi-person tracking and intelligent subject switching. You can also control it remotely using an Apple watch or a second phone but the smartphone functionality may require additional setup. It’s great for travel vloggers, casual creators or anyone who wants solid stabilization without lugging around something bulky. It is priced around $160.  \n  \n4. GoPro fluid pro AI gimbal is designed to handle not just smartphones but also GoPros. It has impressive AI-driven tracking, a built-in fill light and can run up to 18 hours. It doubles as a power bank which makes it really appealing. It’s priced around $230, making it the priciest on this list but you’re paying for flexibility and endurance. It’s not something I’d recommend for casual users or daily vlogging though looking for cost effective gear.  \n  \nAll of these were released in 2025 and it has been a surprisingly strong year for gimbals especially considering how well they go with iPhones. No bad picks this time, just choose based on your style and how much gear you’re willing to carry.",

    "selftext": "So I wanted to share a really disappointing experience with Caudabe today. I figured I’d change things up from the usual Dbrand case. What a mistake.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both got new iPhone Airs and ordered a pair of Caudabe Sheath cases directly from their site. Both arrived this morning, and both had quality issues right out of the box:\n\n•\tThe black Sheath was badly warped, and even came missing the unlock/sleep button, making it completely unusable.\n\n•\tThe green Sheath was also slightly warped and had green shavings around the camera cutout, just like leftover material on a rough 3D print.\n\n•\tThe packaging was undamaged, so this clearly happened before shipping.\n\nGiven Caudabe’s premium pricing, this kind of quality control issue is completely unacceptable. You’d expect something like this from a cheap $10 Amazon case, not from a brand that markets itself as “precise and premium.”\n\nI posted about it on r/Caudabe this morning with photos, just explaining the problem and why it’s so disappointing. Within minutes Reddit displayed:  \n\n“Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/Caudabe.”\n\nAlmost immediately after it was taken down, the official Caudabe account opened a private chat asking for my order number. As soon as I mentioned how fast my post was removed and that it looked like they were censoring negative experiences, the chat went completely silent, their account was shown as typing briefly, then never responded again.\n\nTo me, that’s not just bad quality control, it’s unethical brand behavior. Deleting valid customer experiences from their own subreddit to maintain an image doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nAt least when a company like Dbrand messes up, they own it publicly. They let their customers talk openly, fix the issue, and move on with integrity. Caudabe’s approach of silencing criticism while ghosting customers feels shady and erodes trust far more than a few defective cases ever could.\n\nJust a heads-up for anyone thinking about buying from them. Sometimes “minimalist” apparently means minimal accountability, too.",

I’ve been an iPhone user since the original was released in 2007, typically upgrading every 1-2 years, and I’ve never had second thoughts about a purchase. However, the battery life on the air is just not enough for me. \n\nI’m typically taking the phone off charger around 6am, and while sometimes I have some juice left when I go to bed around 11pm or so, many times it’s on low battery mode, or I have to top it off. I wouldn’t consider myself a power user, but I use my phone consistently throughout the day. The battery is at 100% capacity, and it’s struggling to keep up with my needs. It’s hard to imagine what it would be like at 90% capacity. \n\nWhen I couple the battery issues with the camera deficiencies and the single speaker, I’m left regretting my purchase. I do make calls on speaker sometimes, and the single speaker can make it hard to hear the person on the other end. I do like the form factor, and that is why I gave it a shot, but to have dramatically better battery/camera/speaker for only $100 more with the pro, I will be returning my air and purchasing the pro. I will miss having a lighter phone, but the tradeoffs on performance are simply not worth it. ",

    "selftext": "I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 to an Air and I was nervous that the formula for the Air (small battery, less camera, etc.) was going to create product that simply wouldn’t be commercial. With all the press around the launch  I was almost scared off from buying the Air since it was dismissed as a big mis-step for Apple in the vein of Apple Intelligence. Being an Apple fan boy since my first iPod, I’ve always considered that any product I buy from Apple is going to be one of the best products I’ve ever purchased. I was concerned that the Air simply couldn’t live up to this expectation especially for the price. But how wrong I was! A month into using my new phone, it’s quite simply the best piece of hardware I’ve owned, and here’s why:\n\nThe highlights of the experience are mainly in the fluidity of IOS26 paired with the promotion display, the phone flies compared to my 12. My interactions with the phone are way more engaging and natural, stack on Dynamic Island and all of the intrigue from the transparency effects in this OS - i basically just want to stare at it even if i have nothing to really do on it. \n\nWhich brings me to my main point which is: Apple is still at the forefront of hardware and software integration. Despite all the hot air around AI and how abysmal Siri really is, Apple has really doubled down on unifying the software and hardware to the point that using a button feels like touching the software, touching the hardware feels like touching the OS directly. As a consumer I find that very compelling. If a product is so well considered that the form of the hardware is indistinguishable from the software it really opens up a new tech experience which I think is worth more than AI functionality. \n\nI notice the considerations for the hardware on the Air, thinness being the biggest, and I greatly enjoy the design direction it conveys: make the tech invisible so that the experience feels like magic. I think that’s always been a focal point for apple’s brand and why the Air feels like the first return to the Jobs era of product design for the iPhone lineup in a long time. A product that blurs the edges between digital space and the physical world (without a headset) will get my money every time. ",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed.

    "selftext": "I've never owned a galaxy S8 (used apple, oneplus, pixel, then my first samsung was my current s24 ultra), but I feel like it's the most influential Android phone in the last 10 years in terms of physical design. It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Samsung is canceling the upcoming s26 edge completly. but should it?\n\nCurrent reports say its because of poor sales of the 25 edge (only 178k in the first month) vs the other s series (s25 ultra with 1.5m, s25 with more than 1m). \n\nFor my opinion, the poor sales of the s25 edge were caused only because thats a new technology and it was mostly a prototype phone.\nIt had many problems and seemed rushed and unfinished (wasnt that thin, small battery, no telephoto camera). It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

The phone suddenly stopped working overnight while charging normally.\n\nI sent it for repair through the official Google channel and received a diagnosis of “liquid damage”, with a repair quote of € 644.52 (out of warranty).\n\nHowever, the phone was never exposed to water. I asked Google Support for objective technical evidence (report, photos, LCI readings, methodology, technician ID, etc.), but they said they don’t have any documentation or photos, since the device was returned immediately after I declined the quote.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2019/771 (transposed in Portugal as Decree-Law 84/2021), sellers must provide technical proof when excluding warranty due to alleged misuse — otherwise, the fault is presumed to have existed at delivery.\n\nThe case was escalated to a “second-line” team three days ago, but I haven’t received any update.\n\nHas anyone in the EU experienced a similar situation with Google repairs? Were you able to get photos, a technical report, or have the decision overturned?\n\nI just want a transparent and evidence-based assessment — nothing more, nothing less.",

    "selftext": "Hi all! I've been working on something I think you'll find useful. **Media Bar** transforms your Android status bar into a functional media controller and progress indicator.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nInstead of pulling down notifications or switching apps to control your music/podcast/video, you can now:\n\n* **See media progress** as a thin colored bar along your status bar\n* **Swipe left/right** on the status bar to scrub through your media\n* **Tap, double-tap, or long-press** three invisible regions on the status bar for custom actions (play/pause, skip, jump forward/back, launch app, etc.)\n\n**How is this different from Android's Live Notifications or OneUI's Now Bar?**\n\nWhile Android's live notifications and Samsung's Now Bar are excellent features, Media Bar takes a different approach:\n\n* **Always visible, minimal footprint** \\- Just a thin line on your status bar (can be as small as 1 pixel), not a pill or expandable widget that takes screen real estate\n* **Blind muscle memory control** \\- Your entire status bar becomes an interactive surface. No need to look for or tap specific small buttons\n* **Works system-wide** \\- Doesn't matter which media app you're using or which Android skin you have\n* **Swipe to scrub** \\- Directly scrub through your media by swiping, rather than tapping skip buttons\n* **Deep customization** \\- Color coding for progress tracking, custom button zones, transparency options, etc.\n\nThink of it as complementary to those features - it's for when you want the most minimal, muscle-memory-based control possible.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI found myself constantly interrupting my workflow to control media playback - whether I was gaming, browsing, or working. I wanted something that was always visible and accessible without being intrusive.\n\n**The \"aha\" moment:**\n\nHere's the thing - **Media Bar might feel a bit unusual at first, but give it a day or two.** Once your muscle memory kicks in, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n\nImagine this: You're at the gym mid-rep and need to pause your music. Instead of fumbling to find the play button, your thumb just *knows* where to tap on the status bar. Or you're deep into a 3-hour podcast and want to skip ahead - a quick swipe does it without even looking.\n\n**That's the magic**: your fingers learn the zones, and suddenly media control becomes second nature. No more hunting for tiny buttons or pulling focus from what you're doing. It just... flows. I'm confident that once it becomes part of your routine, it'll feel indispensable.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Color coding options** \\- Solid colors, dynamic (based on album art/app), segments (changes color at different progress points), or gradients\n\n**Highly customizable** \\- Adjust the bar's thickness (down to 1 pixel!), position (top/bottom), transparency, button regions, and more\n\n**Smart behavior** \\- Auto-hides in fullscreen apps, works with any media player\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, [get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.mediabar)! I would love to hear what you guys think about it and happy to answer any questions you may have! I would specifically like to hear if you build a muscle memory for it! :)",

The issue got escalated to an incident this morning.\n\nWell, I just got news that Google thinks the Pixel hanging/crashing apps bug is now fixed. I've asked for clarification on whether the fix is server-side or requires a Play Services update. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977868145840050230\n\n**Update**: Alright, got confirmation that the Pixel crashing/hanging apps fix is server-side. There will be a post-mortem within Google, but I'm not sure if it will be made public. Incidents like this one cannot happen again. The Android System Intelligence issue is still being worked on. https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1977877354082087048",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Recently, I was searching for flip phone reviews and saw an article on the Vertu website. The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

Usually to try and prevent issues like this and keep my new phone \"clean\" where possible\n* Pixel Watch -> Initially, the steps counter was \"real-time\" and would update every 2-5 steps on average.   Lately I can stare at my watch for 15-30 seconds while walking around and not see it update... then all the sudden it'll add a few 100 steps.   \n   * Note, I restarted the watch and it seems to mostly be working now?\n   * I'm not sure what caused this, possibly turning off my phone?  Leaving my watch to function 100% independently and then when my phone was back in proximity it glitched out?\n* I've had frequent issues where attempting to unlock my device, it acts like it's unlocked but won't load any app icons and shows a blank background image.  I press the lock button and try again and it works. \n   * This isn't unique to a Pixel 10 experience, most phones every so often do this but seems far more common on my pixel 10?",

    "selftext": "I've noticed my Pixel 9A has issues recognizing my fingerprints far more often when unlocking the phone than when I log in/ authenticate an app. Apps where I've opted to use fingerprint recognition versus logging in with a password, almost never fail. But depending on the situation, it seems that more than half the time my fingerprint fails to unlock the phone. Does it use tougher standards to unlock or something?  Why would this issue be happening and is there anything I can do about it? Thanks for any input on this.",

    "title": "A Post About Disappointment – My First Flagship Phone (Pixel 10 Pro)",
    "selftext": "This is not a hate post. It’s something way more sad in my opinion. It’s a **disappointment post**. But let me start from the beginning.\n\nI've never had a **flagship phone**, mostly because they were simply too expensive to afford. But I've always been a phone geek, checking new models, new features, and watching countless reviews and comparisons on YouTube. In my life, I've had many phones from different brands, but as I said, never a flagship. And the phone I always craved the most, the one that always got my attention, was the **Google Pixel**.\n\nThe year 2025 came, and I decided this was the moment. Two months after my 33rd birthday, I bought the **Pixel 10 Pro** on the day it premiered. I can’t describe the emotions and dopamine rush I got in that moment. There, in a few days, I was going to own the newest flagship, the pinnacle of technology. Fast forward one month, and that's why I'm writing this post.\n\nI've used the Pixel for over a month, and on a daily basis, I can’t say anything bad about the phone. It looks fantastic, the build quality feels good, and I like the camera and overall performance in daily usage (I'm not a benchmark guy, nor do I do a lot of mobile gaming). However, there are some things that truly made me disappointed after so many years of craving a Google flagship phone.\n\nTo not make this already long post any longer, I’m going to list the things that, in my opinion, are **unacceptable**:\n\n**1.** I know this is a new standard, but I don’t like it, and I’m going to say it loud. Buying a phone for 1370 EUR / $1590 (the 512GB version, price from my country) where you don’t even get a **charger** really feels like a rip-off (i know all brands does it).\n\n**2.** After a month of using it, I discovered there are some **noises coming from the Pixel**. My first thought: \"Oh my god, it's broken.\" I was devastated. You should have seen my face when I discovered the whole **\"rattle gate\"** issue. I mean, your phone sounding like something is broken inside whenever you move it faster gives a terrible experience. Even though it doesn't affect performance, this is not what I was expecting from a flagship for that much money. Big disappointment. Guess you can get used to it though.\n\n**3.** In my one+ month of using the Pixel 10 Pro, I had about **3 separate occasions in which I was unable to make a call**. Just like that. I don't have 2G connection blocked or anything like that. I wanted to call someone, but it never actually started dialing. The problem disappeared only after a **phone reset**.\n\nIn my two-year experience with a $200 Redmi, I never once had such a case. Do I need to tell you how disappointing this is? It's actually a big problem. What if the call I'll be making is very important, or time is crucial? \"Oh sorry, this time you can't call, reset your phone.\" This actually gives me anxiety each time I'm calling now because i don't know if i'll be able to. After investigating a bit, I encountered a lot of posts and articles about problems with the modem/GSM module (sorry if thats not it, not really a technical guy) in Pixel phones. So, it's not something new either. Calling is a basic feature of phones, and now the Pixel is failing in this as well?\n\n**4.** Last but not least, I became a Google Pixel fan mostly because of their **\"pure Android experience\"**—the whole \"you can customize what you want,\" etc. But it turns out, you can't even customize the main screen! The Google search bar is **unremovable**, as is the date/calendar add-on. They *have* to be there. Quite a small choice for a \"customize everything phone.\" Same goes for function buttons, you can't swap the order. I mean c'mon google.\n\nWith the date add-on(or widget - not really sure how to call it), I'm also actually getting a **bug** where sometimes it disappears, but when I click the place on the screen where it's supposed to be, the calendar opens. After restarting the phone, I see the widget again. So, that’s another weird thing.\n\nI don't want this to be another hate post. Before buying this phone I was the biggest Pixel fanboy ever. I really do like this phone despite all the issues. This is just the perspective of someone who got his first flagship in 2025, from a company he always thought was the best in the business. And I’m just **disappointed**.",

    "selftext": "I've been using Pixels since the 4a, always with Gboard. For the last year I used One UI in a Samsung S24 Ultra (so that the missus could have her P9F), always with Gboard. I'm finally back to Pixel with a 10 Fold. \n\nI'm a traditional keyboard user, ie I type, no gliding. Also, I use gestures for navigation (swipe left instead of the back button).\n\nNow to the problem: in my previous Pixel experience (as well as with One UI), when I have Gboard open and want to close it, I simply swipe from left in any part of the screen. With Android 16, however, the swipe left does not close Gboard if done over Gboard. It doesn't work with the \"one hand\" keyboard view either.\n\nTo close the keyboard I need to swipe left in a place above the keyboard or use the down arrow. This is extremely annoying, since I have to overstretch my thumb to reach above the keyboard what ends up moving the phone and requiring my right hand assistance.\n\nI have triple-checked the settings but could not find out how to solve this one.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

After having the 17 pro since release day, I could no longer put up with the stuttering UI and lesser photography compared to others I have had. Switching to the 10 pro I immediately could tell the software and UI is a lot smoother. Like a finished software compared to Apple ongoing bug fixes. I could also tell the photography is way ahead of Apple in daylight and poor lighting. Of course nothing beats the 17 pros videography. But overall I feel the Pixels are coming up quick on Apple and I feel like my 1,000 dollars is better spent for n the Pixel this year which is surprising due to me being Apple since the X. Also the liquid glass is not my cup of tea personally, it feels like too many people developed it and too many ideas mashed together to make a software fruit salad. ",

They can use data to call and when they do that instead of receiving a phone call I'm getting a call via Uber app using data and when that happens exactly the same thing happens my data goes off then on , off then on again. In the Uber when you go flying it shows you offline with the red mark and when you go online it show you as a green Mark and that's exactly what I see. Red green, red green, red green and obviously I cannot connect to customer and I don't hear anything. \n\nThird and final instance when it happened to me is my online doctor appointment. I'm using doxy.me to connect to my doctor and when I am online in the queue waiting for a doctor. Everything is fine but as soon as doctor connects and video and audio starts streaming from him and from me to him I'm getting exactly the same thing data goes off and then back on again constantly until I drop the call. As soon as I drop the call it stops, data goes back in, and it's happening in the chrome because to connect I just go to the website doxy.me/doctorroomname and that's it.\n\nPlease help !\n\nPS \n\nI am on Pixel 10 Pro XL latest public non beta build.

They said I also had to pay a fee ranging from $0 - $99.00 in addition to it.\n\nMy last question is they said for \"other damages\" I would have to pay for parts, do I also have to pay for the labor?

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\ni wanted to share my experiences regarding my Pixel 8 Pro Video Settings and get your take on them.\n\n1) I prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + FHD+ 30fps + HDR + Active Video Stabilization\" because the video is less pixelated and the zoom produces a clearer image (thanks to video optimization) and the brightness is better (adjusted by AI), which works perfectly for videos in low light conditions (such as walking through a tunnel with light at the end). I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation. Even standard stabilisation copes perfectly well with normal walking.\n\n  \n2) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 30fps + HDR +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because of the benefits of the Video Optimization mentioned above (clearer image).\n\n3) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 60fps + HDR not available +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because the additional 30 fps do not provide any additional benefit, except that the size of the video becomes larger.\n\n  \n",

Only some like chrome can once it detects dual screen, but this is very limited.\n\nI SWEAR the Samsung galaxy fold 7 somehow forces these apps for dual screen, or even have a pop up feature.\n\n  \nNot to mention, even though I got use to the camara on the pixel 10 fold, the pixel 10 pro still outshines it.  At least its better than the Galaxy fold 7, which is why I haven't switched to it.\n\n  \nI know this is android, I know there has to be ways or methods to make it work on this pixel 10 fold.  Otherwise If very limited to one screen on majority of the apps I use, I might as well return it and get a regular pixel or invest in a galaxy fold 7, even with the botched cameras.\n\n  \nAny ideas, or suggestions? Anybody played with developer options and see what it has?\n\n",

Deleted cache and storage. Restarted the phone. Reset voice match. Put it to charge without limits, charge optimization off, 100% all night. It is 9:40 pm and I still have 74% - 2:10 SOT.Wow!

Same as last month.\n\nSo for anyone there facing the same, maybe try to delete data from the Google app and let it charge all night to 100%? No clue how might that be related, but it was the only thing I did different from the previous weeks.\n\nI would post a screenshot, but I can't, it is greyed out.\n\nEdit: typos and an update- 6:30 SOT almost 48h since last charge.

I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

    "title": "1 Month Review of Google Pixel 10 Pro - Disappointing for the price, Don't Buy Yet",
    "selftext": "I Bought this phone for my mother who previously had a Pixel 8. She liked the phone overall and was complaining about the battery and it freezing occasionally. She doesn't use her phone for much besides content and communication, so I thought that and the fact she's already in the ecosystem, I'd by her a 10 Pro. After a month of use we're both going to return the phone and try to buy something like a s25+ or 17 pro. Here's my honest review\n\n**Pros**\n\n* *UI/Software -* Phone feels great to use, UI is responsive and visually appealing. I genuinely think it has the best UI out of any phone currently\n* *Hardware -* Feels premium in the hand, a bit heavy but overall the screen, cameras, buttons, charging, and finger print reader keep up with the other phones of the same price and what I'd expect for paying $1k+\n* *AI -* Didn't use too many of the features since it's not my phone, but when I did use it it was all really impressive. The AI photo tools are surprisingly good and useful, and Gemini is miles ahead of other phones, giving actual response (unlike Apple \"Intelligence\")\n\n**Issues**\n\n* *Battery -* For comparison, I have a 2 year old 15 pro max with 80% battery health, I have on average 2 more hours screen time than her on the pixel, and I occasionally game on the 15 pro max. We'd end the day and I'd have more battery almost always compared to her. You should still be able to get through a day of moderate use with a Pixel, but it's a bit lackluster compared to other phones right now.\n* *Freezing -* My mom would mention an app freezing every other day, and in some cases you'd even have to full restart the phone for the app to work. She uses her phone a lot for work, and when your apps keep crashing it makes the entire experience frustrating. I expect maybe in a few months some updates will fix this issue\n* *Google Apps -* Youtube has a decent amount of issues when it comes to going fullscreen, sometimes freezes. Google Maps was the biggest problem. When using it the location and direction were so inaccurate that it was literally unusable(not exaggerating). I tried debugging both, but they are updated and still have issues. You'd expect Google apps to work on a Google Phone, but they both work better on my Iphone.\n\nOverall I really like the Pixel, and was actually looking to switch my phone over after my current one breaks or gets old, but the issues are too glaring. The last straw happened today, her phone was on the lock screen, but completely frozen, the time and notifications were visible, the fingerprint reader was functional, but as soon as you open the phone you're met with a black screen. A restart fixed the issue, but at this point after a month of complaints I think it will just be best if we replace it with a different phone. I think most of the issues will be fixed eventually with updates, but also keep in mind I spent $1100. I don't see the appeal for wanting the current pixel unless you really love the AI features it has. The pixel is slower, has worse battery life, and has more bugs as compared to other phones its price. If you use your phone primarily for photos/social media and don't use game, I'd say wait a few months for them to update them, otherwise I'd avoid buying this phone. I have high hopes for Pixel, however, and hope they can fix the issues in future generations.\n\nThanks for the read, I'll try to answer any questions",

Little did I know Pixels are the ONLY line of major phone brands that don't support Casting onto wireless displays without inbuilt Chromecast (which yeah of course companies won't build in since Pixels represent like 1% of phone sales worldwide...).   \n  \nI get it for TV functionality, but then no smart cast accessories for FILMING/TAKING PICS work on a phone that has HEAVY marketing around its cameras. We will rather have 300 useless AI features, right? (and actually not even that since updated google photos actively destroyed their magic editor and replaced it with substandard way of editing photos and removing stuff, which was also their biggest marketing push since 8pro). \n\nI am less and less likely to buy another pixel next year to be honest...",

They advertise that their case works with PixelSnap and even has product photos of it using a stand, but it's false advertising and their case doesn't work at all with PixelSnap accessories.\n\nThey also have a return policy of 30 days and when I reached out, their automated emailing system said it would be 24 hours before they would get back to me and that never happened. I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what? I finally got a response and they are having me pay for shipping the case back with me just putting a return number in the package. There's not real official return process outside of that \n\nTLDR: The Ghostek Pixel 10 Pro Fold case is a scam and doesn't work with PixelSnap.",

I'm finally back to Pixel with a 10 Fold. \n\nI'm a traditional keyboard user, ie I type, no gliding. Also, I use gestures for navigation (swipe left instead of the back button).\n\nNow to the problem: in my previous Pixel experience (as well as with One UI), when I have Gboard open and want to close it, I simply swipe from left in any part of the screen. With Android 16, however, the swipe left does not close Gboard if done over Gboard. It doesn't work with the \"one hand\" keyboard view either.\n\nTo close the keyboard I need to swipe left in a place above the keyboard or use the down arrow. This is extremely annoying, since I have to overstretch my thumb to reach above the keyboard what ends up moving the phone and requiring my right hand assistance.\n\nI have triple-checked the settings but could not find out how to solve this one.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

Deleted cache and storage. Restarted the phone. Reset voice match. Put it to charge without limits, charge optimization off, 100% all night. It is 9:40 pm and I still have 74% - 2:10 SOT.Wow!

Same as last month.\n\nSo for anyone there facing the same, maybe try to delete data from the Google app and let it charge all night to 100%? No clue how might that be related, but it was the only thing I did different from the previous weeks.\n\nI would post a screenshot, but I can't, it is greyed out.\n\nEdit: typos and an update- 6:30 SOT almost 48h since last charge.

Switching to the 10 pro I immediately could tell the software and UI is a lot smoother. Like a finished software compared to Apple ongoing bug fixes. I could also tell the photography is way ahead of Apple in daylight and poor lighting. Of course nothing beats the 17 pros videography. But overall I feel the Pixels are coming up quick on Apple and I feel like my 1,000 dollars is better spent for n the Pixel this year which is surprising due to me being Apple since the X. Also the liquid glass is not my cup of tea personally, it feels like too many people developed it and too many ideas mashed together to make a software fruit salad. ",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

The camera is a great improvement too, video are better this time.  I always envied iPhone users when they were taking videos, not anymore now.\n\nThe added pixel snap is great too.  Although it gets a bit hot when using it for charging.  \n\nHaving owned the P2, P4XL, P6 Pro and P8 Pro, it's Google's best phone to date in my opinion.  \n\nI'm tired of always having the faster processor out there, the phone works great and feels snappy.  The P8 pro still feel great too by the way.  I'm really glad google doesn't follow Apple's moto of getting the fastest chip out there, it's just not needed.  The experience on the pixel is great and that's what matters.\n\n  \nThe only negative with google is their naming convention :)\n\nFeel free to ask questions.  \n\n",

Also, I use gestures for navigation (swipe left instead of the back button).\n\nNow to the problem: in my previous Pixel experience (as well as with One UI), when I have Gboard open and want to close it, I simply swipe from left in any part of the screen. With Android 16, however, the swipe left does not close Gboard if done over Gboard. It doesn't work with the \"one hand\" keyboard view either.\n\nTo close the keyboard I need to swipe left in a place above the keyboard or use the down arrow. This is extremely annoying, since I have to overstretch my thumb to reach above the keyboard what ends up moving the phone and requiring my right hand assistance.\n\nI have triple-checked the settings but could not find out how to solve this one.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

Deleted cache and storage. Restarted the phone. Reset voice match. Put it to charge without limits, charge optimization off, 100% all night. It is 9:40 pm and I still have 74% - 2:10 SOT.Wow!

Same as last month.\n\nSo for anyone there facing the same, maybe try to delete data from the Google app and let it charge all night to 100%?

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

I know they're currently focusing in appliances and phones, but the cameras? They just wasted an opportunity— I mean they have 200 mp on their cameras they can some improve it. ",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

(The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra?

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

    "selftext": "I’ve never been a big fan of Samsung electronics. Didn’t have anything against them per se, but I just wasn’t often impressed by them. I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

If you’re an engineer that worked on this product - thank you!\n\n1. Loads a bunch of wash fluids (detergent & such). Back saver. \n2. I just set and forget. Literally can get a load done overnight!! Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I’m going to start to train to load and start. ",

It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use?

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

What a POS this Galaxy Ultra watch is compared to Apples Ultra. I love Android and why I'm back but just received my watch in the mail today. \n\nThis thing doesn't notify me of any text/call even though the setting is set to notify both my phone and watch. Try and do the gestures like shake or double finger pinch and when even just testing it says to put on my wrist first, while it's in my wrist!  I've re-positioned this thing and wear it exactly where my Apple Watch was and it never senses my wrist. \n\nAOD is useless, why is it called Always on Display if the display turns off and takes 5 shakes to wake up to view the watch when I'm staring right at it. Have all the settings on correctly even with 1 minute screen timeout on. \n\nLove the orange band and dark titanium look but this is not worth the money. About to just purchase a Garmin 8 and return this POS. \n\nNot going back to iOS that's for sure just want a Galaxy watch that actually works. Samsung has improved the Fold 7 from my original Fold 1 but this watch is useless. \n\nEnd of rant. ",

If you are having an issue when your Galaxy watch goes into a sleep mode where the always on display and raise to wake are being turned off and not turned back on when you wake up, this is for you. Go into your modes and routines and just toggle those settings off in the sleep mode. I know that this is not ideal if you want it to turn on and off automatically however I don't think that having these things on while sleeping really affects wearing the watch much. ",

    "selftext": "My totally serious thoughts on One UI 8 for the Galaxy Watch 7 (aka how I lost an hour just messing with tiles)\n\nAlright, I’ve been playing with One UI 8 for a bit now and… I kinda love it.\nThe new tiles and customisation options are awesome — I spent way too long rearranging them like I was designing a tiny apartment for my wrist.\n\nRunning coach looks interesting too. Can’t wait to see if it motivates me or just roasts me for my “brisk walking” pace.\n\nBut seriously, can someone explain why some of these new features aren’t available on the other Galaxy Watches?\nSame sensors, same everything — but nope, Samsung said “you can look, but you can’t touch.”\n\nHaving Facer back is great though. I’ve already changed my watch face three times today because apparently commitment isn’t my thing.\n\nAlso, the grouped notifications — chef’s kiss. Finally, my wrist doesn’t look like it’s having a notification panic attack.\n\nOverall, One UI 8 feels like a solid glow-up. Just wish Samsung didn’t sprinkle in that classic “you can’t have this yet” energy.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I currently have a Samsung s25 ultra with a magsafe case, the buds 3 pro, and the Galaxy watch 8 classic. I'm curious to see what people have gotten in terms of a bedside wireless charging station I tried the two official ones from Samsung, one with a magnet the other one is just a pad and I didn't really like either of them. The magnetic stand doesn't charge overnight for some reason, and the pad I don't like how finicky alignment can be. I prefer something magnetic if possible but yeah I was wondering what everyone else has. I don't want to get one of those cheap Chinese knockoffs, I've had a bad experience without with my old iPhone, they would burn the cable.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

    "selftext": "I was discovering the features of the One UI 8 on the Galaxy Watch 7, and I expected that, given that they delayed the update for 3 months compared to the rest of the watches that support this feature, it would be supported so that they could wait for the new watches to be sold and then release them to the public, but wow. They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

I noticed a bit of flimsiness and a bit of clang as my arm moves. This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

But after several registration attempts, I kept getting error codes 4001 and 5000.\n\nI went to the Globe Business Center at SM North EDSA, where they told me the service was not yet available, even though it’s already on their website. I also checked with the Samsung Service Center, and they said the same thing — it’s still unavailable. Feeling disappointed, I realized I was misled by outdated information.\n\nNearby, I visited the Smart Telecom Center, where they introduced me to Device Link, their version of Globe One Number. They suggested I apply for a Smart postpaid plan and use Mobile Number Portability (MNP) to keep my Globe number.\n\nThe approval was quick. I went back to Globe to settle my balance, terminate my open-contract plan, and process the number transfer. Then I returned to Smart, where they immediately activated my postpaid and Device Link service.\n\nIt was a frustrating start with Globe, but everything went smoothly once I switched to Smart — and now my watch works perfectly.",

    "selftext": "I was discovering the features of the One UI 8 on the Galaxy Watch 7, and I expected that, given that they delayed the update for 3 months compared to the rest of the watches that support this feature, it would be supported so that they could wait for the new watches to be sold and then release them to the public, but wow. They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

If you are having an issue when your Galaxy watch goes into a sleep mode where the always on display and raise to wake are being turned off and not turned back on when you wake up, this is for you. Go into your modes and routines and just toggle those settings off in the sleep mode. I know that this is not ideal if you want it to turn on and off automatically however I don't think that having these things on while sleeping really affects wearing the watch much. ",

Can’t wait to see if it motivates me or just roasts me for my “brisk walking” pace.\n\nBut seriously, can someone explain why some of these new features aren’t available on the other Galaxy Watches?\nSame sensors, same everything — but nope, Samsung said “you can look, but you can’t touch.”\n\nHaving Facer back is great though. I’ve already changed my watch face three times today because apparently commitment isn’t my thing.\n\nAlso, the grouped notifications — chef’s kiss. Finally, my wrist doesn’t look like it’s having a notification panic attack.\n\nOverall, One UI 8 feels like a solid glow-up. Just wish Samsung didn’t sprinkle in that classic “you can’t have this yet” energy.",

This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

Main thing I have seen is the new faces, especially as they can show stress and oxygen which I didn't find as a complication in previous faces. Albeit the stress reading was accurate before (ok I only got the watch on Friday) still, since today it's all over the place and as I am lounging at home that doesn't make much sense. I tested it with my old Huawei watch that says I am cool as a cucumber with it, while gw7 on the other arm says I am highly stressed (lol I am not, I should know, I have a masters in psychology lol). Really the only things that would have made this interesting are the vascular load and the anti oxidant index which are not included. All that hype for so little... Oh and still abysmal support if you are a tennis player, disappointing ",

They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

If you are having an issue when your Galaxy watch goes into a sleep mode where the always on display and raise to wake are being turned off and not turned back on when you wake up, this is for you. Go into your modes and routines and just toggle those settings off in the sleep mode. I know that this is not ideal if you want it to turn on and off automatically however I don't think that having these things on while sleeping really affects wearing the watch much. ",

Pretty much 6-8 months of use, the Lenovo laptop's miniLED panel develops these pink/purple tinted stripes and patches all over (very visible when light colors are displayed). This has happened twice now. Last year they gave me an extra year of warranty, and they literally took 4 repairs to get the monitor swapped right, 1 month of no laptop to use, and on the 3rd repair I was literally sent back a laptop from CSAT Solutions (Houston, TX) without any SSD inside and they tried to lie about it. This time the warranty repair went smoothly, however they are now only offering a 90 day warranty extension on the laptop that is most likely going to fail again in the same way 6-8 months down the line. I don't think I will consider another Lenovo laptop. The service so far has just been bad.",

Now I need to sell it fast to help buy a replacement for school.\n\n**What definitely works:**\n\n* Display (perfect, like new) 165hz\n* Battery (low cycles, good health)\n* Keyboard (excellent condition)\n* Charger + original bag like new\n\n**What's dead:**\n\n* Motherboard (won't boot)\n* One RAM slot\n* One fan\n* 1-RAM stick\n* Warranty (expired)\n\n**What's unknown:**\n\n* RTX 4060 (looks clean after cleaning, untested)\n* i7 CPU (same - looks okay, can't test)\n* anything else\n\n**I'm thinking €250** for everything (laptop, charger, bag).

I will be running pycharm on it. Simultaenously, I will be running larkplayer, which is a music app, on an android virtualisation. simultaneouslty, i will be running onenote on a windows virtaulisaion. The laptop must be able to handle at minimum the windows virtualisation and pycharm, but preferably also the android virtualisation\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** I would like 32 gigs of RAM, due to my muiltitasking requirements, and I know that 16gigs isnt going to be enough. As i mentioned earlier, it must have a touch screen. That is the most imporatn factor of all, and is the entire reason for this purchase. I dont particularly care about speaker quality, although the mic and webcam must be good enough that im recognisable (720p for example is fine). Any other features, like being AI certified, are not that important.\n\nI am currently looking at the Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 gen 10 laptop (new), which has a ryzen AI 7 350, a 14 inch 120Hz OLED display, and 32 gigs of RAM, with 1TB of storage. It also has the option to not have an OS, which is useful for me, as I am going to load on linux anyway. Therfore, any suggestions must be a decent amounbt cheaper than £909 for me to consider it, as that is my current best price. [https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83JRCTO1WWGB2](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83JRCTO1WWGB2)\n\nIt costs £909, which is at the very top of my budget (I would prefer something £600-700, and I am fully open to refurbished, due to price savings).\n\nThanks in advcance for any help :)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI found this laptop in France on a discount (links below):\n\nhttps://www.auchan.fr/asus-ordinateur-portable-x1605va-sh2054w/pr-236bdd79-de87-4935-9b33-40b194a22594\n\nhttps://www.boulanger.com/ref/1222896\n\nBoth say it’s an ASUS Vivobook 16 X1605VA SH2054W, i5-13420H, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and an OLED 16″ 1920×1200 display.\n\nBut some photos show a backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader while the descriptions don’t mention them. I’m afraid it might actually be an LCD version or that the listing is misleading.\n\nI’ve also done some research on this specific model, and I couldn’t find the SH2054W variant listed anywhere on ASUS’s official website…only other X1605VA configurations appear, which makes me a bit suspicious.\n\nHas anyone here bought this exact model or seen it in person? Is it really OLED, or are French retailers mixing up specs?\n\nThanks.\nPS: I’d rather double-check before spending 700-800€",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I’ve been having charging issues with my dead Latitude 5300 for a while now. It has two charging slots: one for USB-C and the other for the charger that came with it. I’ve always used the charger that came with it. It used to work perfectly, but about three months ago, it stopped charging after I plugged in the charger. It was strange. I thought maybe my charger was going bad, but then the battery completely drained out, so it didn’t detect the charger at all.\n\nThe next day, Since the Latitude 5300 has a USB power delivery option, I used my iPad charger to charge it. It doesn’t charge when it’s powered on, but it does when it’s powered off (probably because of there ipad chargers W output). it charged with the charger for some time and once it was back to life, I connected the original charger, and it started charging again. \n\nFast forward a couple of months, I started getting the same issue again recently. The original charger doesn’t detect the Latitude 5300. It’s a bit of a hit or miss sometimes; it might be detected one day and not the next. But for the past two days, it hasn’t been charging at all with its original charger.\n\nI asked someone I was browsing for the solution, and they told me that the BIOS needs to be updated. I did that as well, but it still doesn’t detect the charger. What could be the problem, and how do I fix it? If the charger was going bad, it shouldn’t work at all. It charges whenever it feels like and doesn’t when it doesn’t.",

My personal laptop is a nearly four year old 14-inch MSI Prestige 14Evo A11 with 11th Gen Core i7,  16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and obviously integrated graphics (Intel's \"Iris(XE)\" system)\n\nAs a sidenote it's been a very good Sixth Form and uni laptop with great what I call classic gaming capability, e.g. Fallout 3 or New Vegas.\n\n(Updated to windows 11 as soon as I got it btw and lost all the MSI software to control fan speed etc 🥲)\n\nHaving paid £800 for it in 2021 - would it even be worth £200 today?\n\nCheers",

    "selftext": "First paragraph is just how I got here. After, I use the \"form\" as recommended.\n\nI think there's a hardware issue with this HP. Under windows 10, it was sluggish - so much so that even my father and law bought a new one. He figured he'd give it to my 7 year old. Having brought old laptops to life with Linux Mint or Ubuntu before, I figured that would fix things. I had to turn off security in the bios and boot from as USB startup, that I created the correct way. But, it was super slow to even load the bios/boot menu. I also noticed the USB ports were flaky. Two on the left side even feel loose. I think this HP is toast.\n\nOk. You're fine if you fast forwarded to here. I want to purchase a laptop that can be dual boot between Windows 11/ Edubuntu or EndlessOS. That means a big enough SSD for both. I don't want any driver headaches or nonsense, either. So, something fairly standard in parts. It can be used / refurbished.\n\n# \n\n**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $400. (I mean, she's 7.)\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes/Yes\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Durability, Performance, Dual-OS/Boot, Screen quality, not go obsolete tomorrow\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Don't care, really\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** N/A\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** It is possible she will do photo editing, as she has her own camera. It needs to run GIMP on the Linux side, maybe a RAW editor. She will otherwise have educational games.\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Learning games. Otherwise N/A sort of.\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** It must survive a hyper 7 year old. I do not want a touch screen.\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** It must have a headphone/line out for audio. Most do anyway. We have a family spotify account she'll be using. Prefer 11/12th gen or newer if Intel. Just dont want it dragging or becoming obsolete right away. 16GB of RAM, minimum!\n\nThank you! I've been looking at Dell Latitude and some business-oriented ones, like Lenovo, but when I spec out what I want, it easily goes over $400. Talk me down.",

I though the heat sink had an unseen screw but did not. Replaced thermal paste after littery 2-3hr cleaning thoroughly with alcohol pads. Then replaced with arctic mx-4. Still the same. Many hours of phone calls later I get to asus and they tell me they can replace all but the laptop (ie the motherboard). They take it the next day and replace nothing and send it back saying nothing is wrong (we could not duplicate the issues). So I'm at a 3rd attempt to send it for repair and they won't accept and keep canceling. Curry won't take it as on finance and my finance company also want evidence. ",

I've got a strict budget of £150 and know I wont get anything spectacular, but I'm sure I should be able to get something older but usable second hand for that price. So could you guys give me some tips on what specs I should be keeping an eye out for as minimum?",

I'm trying to decide whether I should return it or exchange it because I do almost all my work on my iPad and now that I have a desktop, when I need to do more, I use that. Do you guys think it would work to just have my iPad with maybe just a keyboard (does lockdown browser work on an iPad?). I'm a university student just for context. My PC is a Windows 11 and I have the 10th gen iPad. \n\nEdit: I feel really stupid now because it was just dead. My charger didn't actually work last night. So the Chromebook is fully functional but I'm still debating whether I should bring it back. ",

    "selftext": "This is the first time I'll be purchasing my own personal laptop, so I'll be needing some guidance and good recommendations. My budget is around 50-60k Indian Rupees (586-681 Dollars) which I can increase upto 70k (795 dollars) if it's really required and within that I need a laptop which is not only great for students but also can provide me good editing experience (not a pro editor), great graphics and a more than decent gaming experience as well (even if not a gaming experience like a pure gaming laptop). Well basically I am a student who needs for mostly projects, basic editing, student's purpose and a medium casual gamer, although even tho I mostly do casual gaming but on somedays I can do hardcore gaming for long hours and that too high graphic games, so the gaming performance does matter to me as well even tho I'm a casual gamer and not a hardcore gamer in general. At first I had my eyes on Samsung Galaxy book 4 intel i7 13th Gen 1335U, it's a great laptop with great specs, ui, features and provides more than decent gaming experience on medium graphics. Honestly probably the best laptop for students at this price point but the reason on why I'm hesitant to buy is because it's 1335\"U\" which stands for ultra low power, although I need a processor starting from \"H\" high performance or HS or HX, but most preferrably H or HS, as the HX processors laptop drain a lot of battery due to its extreme desktop level performance. Also the galaxy book 4 doesn't even has dedicated nvidea genforce rtx graphic cards but comes comes with integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, neither it has a dedicated graphic memory capacity. Lenovo LOC is a bit above the budget but I was still willing to purchase it considering it's all arounder ability, great gaming, cooling system and dedicated rtx 3050 but considering that it's processor is i5 13th Gen 13450\"HX\" so it's not efficient for normal tasks as it's gonna drain a lot of battery even in normal tasks and even more in gaming 🥲, the battery life is gonna be a nightmare for me as someone who's gonna buy this laptop for mostly \"student\" and other casual uses, also the thermals are quite poor, and the laptop heats up very quickly plus let's not forget that there have been multiple reports of motherboard failure in the LOQ series as well. So please give your helpful valuable recommendations to me, so that I can choose the best laptop suitable for my need and won't have any regrets 🙏🏼. My minimum required specifications are:- \nRam - minimum 16gb with minimum of 3200MHZ\nProcessor - starting from Intel i5 13th Gen(minimum) and should be H (High performance) or HS (but more power efficient than H)\nGraphics card - minimum of Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 with minimum dedicated graphic memory capacity of 4GB\nSSD- the SSD generation should be minimum of Gen.4\nTGP- should have decent TGP number\n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

Pretty much 6-8 months of use, the Lenovo laptop's miniLED panel develops these pink/purple tinted stripes and patches all over (very visible when light colors are displayed). This has happened twice now. Last year they gave me an extra year of warranty, and they literally took 4 repairs to get the monitor swapped right, 1 month of no laptop to use, and on the 3rd repair I was literally sent back a laptop from CSAT Solutions (Houston, TX) without any SSD inside and they tried to lie about it. This time the warranty repair went smoothly, however they are now only offering a 90 day warranty extension on the laptop that is most likely going to fail again in the same way 6-8 months down the line. I don't think I will consider another Lenovo laptop. The service so far has just been bad.",

Warranty just expired (perfect timing, right? 😭).\n\nTook it to a tech in Italy who cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol. He said he doesn't have ultrasonic equipment and even if he temporarily fixed it, the damage would probably come back. Recommended selling for parts.\n\n**I'm a student and this was my main laptop** for everything. Now I need to sell it fast to help buy a replacement for school.\n\n**What definitely works:**\n\n* Display (perfect, like new) 165hz\n* Battery (low cycles, good health)\n* Keyboard (excellent condition)\n* Charger + original bag like new\n\n**What's dead:**\n\n* Motherboard (won't boot)\n* One RAM slot\n* One fan\n* 1-RAM stick\n* Warranty (expired)\n\n**What's unknown:**\n\n* RTX 4060 (looks clean after cleaning, untested)\n* i7 CPU (same - looks okay, can't test)\n* anything else\n\n**I'm thinking €250** for everything (laptop, charger, bag).

If indifferent, put N/A.** at least 13 inches\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** I would like to run programming and software development apps, as well as capcut\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** I will be running linux as my main operating system. I will be running pycharm on it. Simultaenously, I will be running larkplayer, which is a music app, on an android virtualisation. simultaneouslty, i will be running onenote on a windows virtaulisaion. The laptop must be able to handle at minimum the windows virtualisation and pycharm, but preferably also the android virtualisation\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** I would like 32 gigs of RAM, due to my muiltitasking requirements, and I know that 16gigs isnt going to be enough. As i mentioned earlier, it must have a touch screen. That is the most imporatn factor of all, and is the entire reason for this purchase. I dont particularly care about speaker quality, although the mic and webcam must be good enough that im recognisable (720p for example is fine). Any other features, like being AI certified, are not that important.\n\nI am currently looking at the Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 gen 10 laptop (new), which has a ryzen AI 7 350, a 14 inch 120Hz OLED display, and 32 gigs of RAM, with 1TB of storage. It also has the option to not have an OS, which is useful for me, as I am going to load on linux anyway. Therfore, any suggestions must be a decent amounbt cheaper than £909 for me to consider it, as that is my current best price. [https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83JRCTO1WWGB2](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83JRCTO1WWGB2)\n\nIt costs £909, which is at the very top of my budget (I would prefer something £600-700, and I am fully open to refurbished, due to price savings).\n\nThanks in advcance for any help :)",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I’ve been having charging issues with my dead Latitude 5300 for a while now. It has two charging slots: one for USB-C and the other for the charger that came with it. I’ve always used the charger that came with it. It used to work perfectly, but about three months ago, it stopped charging after I plugged in the charger. It was strange. I thought maybe my charger was going bad, but then the battery completely drained out, so it didn’t detect the charger at all.\n\nThe next day, Since the Latitude 5300 has a USB power delivery option, I used my iPad charger to charge it. It doesn’t charge when it’s powered on, but it does when it’s powered off (probably because of there ipad chargers W output). it charged with the charger for some time and once it was back to life, I connected the original charger, and it started charging again. \n\nFast forward a couple of months, I started getting the same issue again recently. The original charger doesn’t detect the Latitude 5300. It’s a bit of a hit or miss sometimes; it might be detected one day and not the next. But for the past two days, it hasn’t been charging at all with its original charger.\n\nI asked someone I was browsing for the solution, and they told me that the BIOS needs to be updated. I did that as well, but it still doesn’t detect the charger. What could be the problem, and how do I fix it? If the charger was going bad, it shouldn’t work at all. It charges whenever it feels like and doesn’t when it doesn’t.",

Pretty much 6-8 months of use, the Lenovo laptop's miniLED panel develops these pink/purple tinted stripes and patches all over (very visible when light colors are displayed). This has happened twice now. Last year they gave me an extra year of warranty, and they literally took 4 repairs to get the monitor swapped right, 1 month of no laptop to use, and on the 3rd repair I was literally sent back a laptop from CSAT Solutions (Houston, TX) without any SSD inside and they tried to lie about it. This time the warranty repair went smoothly, however they are now only offering a 90 day warranty extension on the laptop that is most likely going to fail again in the same way 6-8 months down the line. I don't think I will consider another Lenovo laptop. The service so far has just been bad.",

Warranty just expired (perfect timing, right? 😭).\n\nTook it to a tech in Italy who cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol. He said he doesn't have ultrasonic equipment and even if he temporarily fixed it, the damage would probably come back. Recommended selling for parts.\n\n**I'm a student and this was my main laptop** for everything. Now I need to sell it fast to help buy a replacement for school.\n\n**What definitely works:**\n\n* Display (perfect, like new) 165hz\n* Battery (low cycles, good health)\n* Keyboard (excellent condition)\n* Charger + original bag like new\n\n**What's dead:**\n\n* Motherboard (won't boot)\n* One RAM slot\n* One fan\n* 1-RAM stick\n* Warranty (expired)\n\n**What's unknown:**\n\n* RTX 4060 (looks clean after cleaning, untested)\n* i7 CPU (same - looks okay, can't test)\n* anything else\n\n**I'm thinking €250** for everything (laptop, charger, bag).

    "selftext": "* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** £1000 max budget for the UK, although would prefer something closer to the £600-700 range\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Refurbished is fine\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** must have a touch screen, and last at absolute minimum 6 hours without charging, but battery life should be closer to 8 hours\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** I need to carry it in my bag all day, so it shouldn't be too heavy (like a massive gaming laptop), but it isn't a top priority\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** at least 13 inches\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** I would like to run programming and software development apps, as well as capcut\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** I will be running linux as my main operating system. I will be running pycharm on it. Simultaenously, I will be running larkplayer, which is a music app, on an android virtualisation. simultaneouslty, i will be running onenote on a windows virtaulisaion. The laptop must be able to handle at minimum the windows virtualisation and pycharm, but preferably also the android virtualisation\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** I would like 32 gigs of RAM, due to my muiltitasking requirements, and I know that 16gigs isnt going to be enough. As i mentioned earlier, it must have a touch screen. That is the most imporatn factor of all, and is the entire reason for this purchase. I dont particularly care about speaker quality, although the mic and webcam must be good enough that im recognisable (720p for example is fine). Any other features, like being AI certified, are not that important.\n\nI am currently looking at the Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 gen 10 laptop (new), which has a ryzen AI 7 350, a 14 inch 120Hz OLED display, and 32 gigs of RAM, with 1TB of storage. It also has the option to not have an OS, which is useful for me, as I am going to load on linux anyway. Therfore, any suggestions must be a decent amounbt cheaper than £909 for me to consider it, as that is my current best price. [https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83JRCTO1WWGB2](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/configurator/cto/index.html?bundleId=83JRCTO1WWGB2)\n\nIt costs £909, which is at the very top of my budget (I would prefer something £600-700, and I am fully open to refurbished, due to price savings).\n\nThanks in advcance for any help :)",

I know the CPU is overheating because when I turn it back on I get a  \"CPU Overheating alert\" before it shuts back off.\n\n  \nIt's an NZXT pre-build that has an AIO. I've done the following to troubleshoot:\n\n* Felt the AIO tubes to make sure fluid is pumping through them (feels fine)\n* Checked that the exhaust fan for the AIO is running\n* Replaced the thermal paste on the CPU - AIO interface\n* Turned the PC on and tilted it in all directions in attempt to clear air bubbles\n* Turned the PC on and pressed the AIO down onto the CPU to ensure good contact\n* Booting to BIOS and watching the CPU Temperature\n\n  \nAfter all of those troubleshooting steps, I see the temperature rise steadily from around 50c to 91c before the computer shuts down even from BIOS. This is the same behavior as before I tried anything.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure what else to do at this point besides replace the CPU, motherboard, or AIO, but wanted to see if there's anything else I should try.

    "selftext": "\n\nHello everyone, hope you are having a great day/night. \n\nMy cousin came over the weekend and I played him the 1st hour of clair obscur expedition 33. He is not a big gamer, but he has liked indie titles like little nightmares and we played a demo from reanimal. He appreciates good atmosphere graphics and stories so I knew he would love coe33 as he hasn't played anything similar to it(even if there is anything haha). \n\nHe is now hooked and he just moved into his first house by himself. He doesn't know anything about computers and as I am the one in the family who kinda knows his stuff.\n\n The problem I have when trying to recommend him something though is that I have a 5080 and I play at 1440p While he has a 4k tv that he wants to game on and no GPU that can go near 4k.\n\n His system is an am4 system with a 2600x and 16gigs of ram. Do you think a 5070 with dlss on performance would cut it for 4k clair obscur? Maybe lowering some settings? Will the CPU be able to keep up? 4k is not too tough on the CPU but as the CPU is a bit old I am thinking it might even have trouble with the engine itself. Maybe even ram should be expanded but that is a pretty easy upgrade.\n\nDo you guys think 12gbs for 4k is too low even for lowered settings? I think that my cousin will be satisfied with the fidelity of dlss 4 performance and if his tv goes above 60hz(he doesn't know, I would have to check when I go over)  he can even try out frame gen. He is mostly a controller player so even some extra latency would go unnoticed. Is the 5070 worth considering? \n\nI don't really like the amd side as not many games have fsr 4 compared to dlss 4 and especially at 4k using dlss on performance is a great performance boost while on a budget while also lowering vram requirements.

I don't really have a budget, but I also want to be somewhat responsible (excluding the processor purely for my nerdy map games). I already own the case and power supply, I just thought that I'd include it for more context.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\ndI just finished assembling my new PC and I have a critical problem: I'm not getting any video signal. I connected the PC to the TV via HDMI, but the screen remains black.\n\nThe PC turns on, the fans spin, the RGB LEDs all work, but the motherboard (MSI MPG B850) shows debug codes that change depending on the RAM configuration.\n\nHere's the situation with the RAM:\n\n* **Configuration 1:** 2 RAM sticks (Corsair Vengeance 6000mhz) + 2 \"dummy\" sticks (Light Enhancement Kit) -> **Debug Code: 01**\n* **Configuration 2:** Only 1 RAM stick (Stick A) -> **Debug Code: 00**\n* **Configuration 3:** Only 1 RAM stick (Stick B) -> **Debug Code: 01**\n\nIt seems one RAM stick (or the slot?) gives a different code than the other. The **00** code seems positive, but even when \"00\" appears, I still have no video signal. The **01** code appears with one RAM stick as well as with the dummies.\n\nMy full PC specs:\n\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 TI MSI Gaming Trio OC White\n* **Riser Cable:** Linkup Ava 5 PCIe 5.0\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* **Motherboard:** MSI MPG B850 EDGE TI WIFI\n* **RAM:** CORSAIR Vengeance RGB 6000mhz 64GB (2 x 32GB) CL30\n* **RAM Dummies:** CORSAIR Vengeance RGB DDR5 Light Enhancement Kit (x2)\n* **SSD:** SAMSUNG 990 Pro 2TB\n* **Cooler:** THERMALRIGHT Core Vision 360 White ARGB AIO\n* **PSU:** GIGABYTE Aorus Elite P850W Ice\n* **Case:** MSI Mag Pano 100R PZ Midi-tower Atx\n\nThings I've already checked:\n\n* The HDMI cable is plugged **directly into the GPU** (5070 TI), not the motherboard's HDMI port.\n* I've tried reseating the GPU and the riser cable.\n* I tried RAM slots A2 and B2 as per the manual.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Does anyone know what debug codes **00** and **01** mean on this MSI motherboard? I couldn't find clear info in the manual.\n2. Is it possible the **PCIe 5.0 riser cable** is the problem? Could it be faulty or require a specific setting in the BIOS (which I can't access)?\n3. Does the fact that one RAM stick gives \"00\" and the other \"01\" (like the dummies) mean there's a problem with one RAM stick?\n\nI'm pretty desperate and don't know what else to try. Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks a million in advance!",

I waited a bit, and the logo my PC always shows appeared, but with a panning effect and low resolution. Then I kept waiting, and it froze, and there was no picture anymore.\n\n\n\nI had to turn it off because even the button didn't respond, so I unplugged it.

    "title": "Search for a minimalist, windowless (ATX) case",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am looking for a rather compact pc case that doesn't screams \"GAMING\" and looks **minimalist** and/or Apple-ish. I'd love a raw **aluminum** case but **white** is good as well. I don't want a glass side-panel but if it's unavoidable I can still put furniture foil over it or something.\n\nFurther below I compiled a list of cases I liked and found to meet my needs to a varying degree. The last one on the list I actually like a lot but maybe there is something even nicer out there I couldn't find?\n\nI currently have an ATX mainboard, a normal-sized PSU (Dark Power Pro 11 550W), a medium-chonky bequiet! CPU cooler (can't check which one rn unfortunately) and an RTX 4070 FE (dual-slot, 240 x 110 x 40 mm). I am generally kind of open for non-ATX form factors but I'd much prefer to keep my current mainboard (I need 2 NVMe slots). I'd be willing to change my PSU and cooler if I have to.\n\nHere are some cases I like but that don't really tick all boxes:\n\n* [Teenage Engineering computer-1](https://teenage.engineering/store/computer-1-aluminum): A case that I'd buy if it would fit my 4070 because I like the looks a lot\n* [Jonsbo RM2](https://www.amazon.de/Jonsbo-RM2-Midi-Tower-Computergeh%C3%A4use-Dezentes/dp/B08DP2FYX8GgxOTY5NjU0MTA0): It's okay, but I don't really dig the brushed look. Plus it has no front USB-C and looks a bit like a toaster lol\n* [Jonsbo T9 Silver](https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/T9Silver.html): Not entirely sure about the wood but would be a very strong contender if it wasn't ITX. (Same goes for NV10 Silver and N2 White)\n* [NCASE M3 Grater](https://ncased.com/collections/m-series/products/m3-grater): Looks cool (like a Mac Pro) but won't fit an ATX mb or my PSU. Also has no front IO (wth). M2 Round solves the latter but not the ATX problem. (Same goes for T1 Silver. Both very nice tho)\n* [CM Elite 302 Lite](https://www.coolermaster.com/en-global/products/elite-302-lite/): Kinda nice-looking and ATX, but has a glass side-panel. Maybe replaceable with a frosted glass panel or something? (301 Elite Lite Steel Left Panel looks okay-ish but not more)\n* [CM Silencio S400 White Edition](https://www.coolermaster.com/en-global/products/silencio-s400-white/): Looks okay, but also has a glass panel. (Sharkoon Rebel C50 White kinda looks like an alternative, but I don't really like it)\n* [Fractal North](https://www.fractal-design.com/de/products/cases/north/north/Chalk%20White/): I don't like the overall design too much and prefer aluminium, but it's ATX\n* [ASUS ProArt PA401 Wood Edition Beige](https://www.asus.com/de/motherboards-components/cases/proart/proart-pa401-wood-edition-beige-mesh-panel/): I like the wood and the curves, but I am unsure about the beige. A strong contender though\n* [HAVN BF 360](https://havn.global/products/bf-360?variant=56269554418048): Would be a case of furniture film onto the glass. I like the unique stone front.\n* [Hyte X50 Air](https://hyte.com/de/store/x50/cs-hyte-x50a-ww?zCountry=DE): This I like a lot. No. 1 on my shortlist\n\nOn this list there are some cases I would consider buying right now but maybe I missed something else that would fit my needs (almost) perfectly? Even if not, I hope that the list above might help someone else find a nice case for themselves. Thanks already for your help! :)",

My PC was working totally fine and ran really good. One day, it wouldn’t post anymore. I didn’t touch anything besides that I installed Windows 11 (as a fresh install). The Mainboard indicators always went from DRAM - CPU - VGA and then stuck at VGA with BOOT lighting up shortly after too. (To be specific, DRAM and CPU lit up and went out again). I almost lost my mind that evening but in the end, I got it running again by updating the BIOS. I then upgraded to new and slightly better RAM.\nIt ran just fine after that for like 6 months and then BOOM! Same problem. No post, VGA lit up. So naturally I thought my GPU died. \nStill hoping the GPU might be okay though, I bought a new Mainboard (ASUS TUF B550 Gaming WiFi II) but got the absolute same problem. No Post, stuck at VGA. \n\nSo fast forward to today (I had to save money for a new one) I finally got my new RX 9060 XT (16GB) and were ready to finally play some games again! Installed it, checked everything twice, fingers crossed and pushed the Power button…\nSame. Old. Problem…\nNo Post, stuck at VGA…\n\nDevastated I scrambled through my old stuff and found one of my old GPU‘s must’ve been an AMD too but not sure what exactly. It’s tiny, doesn’t need external Power. Aaaaand, Boom! PC boots up, though I can’t boot into windows cause the GPU isn’t supported for TMP or whatever. \n\nNow, it’s absolutely possible that the PSU might have an issue of some sorts and I’ll order a new one at the end of the month anyway. But I really fear it might actually be the CPU that is faulty because the new Card only needs one 8 Pin connector instead of two, so that should make a difference for sure. But If I use the old, most likely not 16x PCI-E Card, It Posts. So maybe the Memory Controller or anything like that could be broken and causing trouble or am I wrong?\n\nIs that even possible given the symptoms?\n",

I caught it mid-air so it didn’t make impact to the ground. \n\nI’m a little knowledgeable but not… phenomenally or remarkably, so when I noticed the Bluetooth on my PC was “not turned on” I immediately unplugged it, opened it up and took a look inside.\n\nVisually, nothing looks wrong other than some mild sagging of my GPU, which I fixed by just tightening it back up and I managed to fix the Bluetooth issue by just pressing on it to make sure it was in place, figured it was fixed because everything seemed to be working fine and went to bed.\n\nWoke up this morning, booted it up to work on some things and my keyboard, mouse and headphones were disconnecting and reconnecting every 10-15 seconds and I just now fixed it by simply just plugging them into different ports (still pending testing, who knows at this point, might still be an issue after posting this)\n\nI’ve never had any USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi issues until the fire nation (my cat) attacked last night.\n\nAs of right now, Bluetooth is back to not working. I guess I’m wondering if I need to go back in and look for physical issues again and if so, what should I be looking for??\n\nI have the ASRock A320M/ac, so the Bluetooth/wifi component is built into the motherboard, hence my hesitation to go in there messing with it without some sort of 3rd party insight.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar issue and can point me in the right direction I’d be appreciative.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI went caveman style and started (gently) pushing anything I could see. Booted it up, everything works fine now. I have no idea which component was causing it but I am gonna wait and see if it happens again. For now, it’s running fine and my cat is indefinitely banned from being within 6 feet of my PC.\nHe has no remorse. He screamed in my face earlier.\n\n",

    "title": "Corrupt bios after power outage?",
    "selftext": "As the title says, I believe my bios to be corrupted (somehow). I'll explain in more detail, but I'm looking for more opinions and guidance (if possible) on how to fix it. Disclaimer: I'm by no means a computer expert, I'm an amateur at best.\n\nThe build:\nI purchased the parts a little over 2 years ago, most were second hand, and I had a computer savvy person put them together. All components were compatible and working, and both the power supply + ssd were the only components purchased new. Everything was in working order, though I could use more RAM.\n\nThe issue:\nA couple months ago, while my computer was on and running fine, we had a power outage. After that, it would no longer 'post', no bios would flash on screen, peripherals stopped working, and it'd enter 'boot loop'. The fans would spin and the GPU, motherboard, and monitor lights turned on just fine, it's just that I'd get no image and my mouse/keyboard weren't working.\n\nTroubleshooting:\nMy first assumption was \"it's likely faulty RAM\", the reasoning being that I play games that require more RAM than I had. I, however, found out RAM wasn't the issue. Here's a list of troubleshooting steps I already tried:\n\n- Reseating RAM on a different slot\n- Purchasing more RAM and swapping the old one out\n- Trying all the 3 RAM sticks I now had available, one by one, just in case there was a faulty one\n- All RAM sticks at once, in separate slots\n- Dual channel with new RAM sticks\n\nAfter that, I thought \"it's probably windows who got corrupted\" (it wasn't). So I tried:\n\n- Tried unplugging sata SSD, running only on sata HDD. Still didn't work\n- Tried unplugging HDD, running only on SSD. Also didn't work\n- Attempted to run without any HDD or SSD unit plugged, still no post, only fans spinning and boot loop\n\nFigured if it wasn't a corrupt windows causing a boot loop without post, then it must be something else. My next thought was \"is it the GPU who gave out?\" (spoiler: it wasn't the gpu either)\n\n- Thinking it was the GPU, I connected my monitor to my motherboard port instead, as it has integrated graphics. Didn't fix the issue\n- I'm not skilled enough to unplug my GPU from its slot, but I did disconnect the little cable that connects the motherboard to it. Also didn't fix the issue\n- Observed that there was a little blue light on my GPU that, when plugged into the motherboard, would turn on along with the rest of the components. This LED me (pun intended) to think the GPU is (probably) operational.\n- Unplugged all peripherals except for monitor and keyboard at this point.\n- Observed the motherboard LEDs work just fine\n\nWith nothing else in my limited knowledge to try, I reset the CMOS by removing the battery, waiting 5 minutes, and re-seating it. Nothing.\nThen, I tried replacing it with an identical battery I had, that I knew worked (it was from a glucose monitor thingy, different brand of battery but same model). That also didn't work.\nTested both batteries with a voltage apparatus, the old CMOS battery was at lower power than the newer one.\nLastly, I kept the CMOS battery out for a week, JUST in case the 5min wasn't enough y'know?\nAfter the week was up, I plugged it in, and still nothing.\n\nIs there something else I could/should try or are the odds stacked against it being a bios issue?\n\nTIA!!\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm completely at my wit's end with a problem and I'm hoping you can help, because I'm all out of ideas.\n\nWe're having a bunch of weird power outages where I live. Yesterday, after one of them, my headset (both audio and mic) stopped working on my PC. No big deal, I just reinstalled the Realtek drivers, and everything went back to normal.\n\nThen today... another outage. This time, only the mic died. The headset audio is perfectly fine, I can hear everything, but nobody can hear me.\n\nThe most important part: I plugged the headset into my tablet, and the mic works perfectly. So the headset itself (it's a HAVIT model) is fine. The problem is 100% on the PC.\n\n\n\nWhat I've already tried:\n\n* Tested both front and rear panel audio jacks.\n* Bought and tested a brand new Y-splitter (it wasn't the adapter).\n* Completely reinstalled/updated audio drivers (Realtek), both via Windows and from the motherboard's official website.\n* Checked all Win10 Privacy settings (mic access is enabled).\n* Checked Sound Control Panel > Recording (mic is default, not muted, levels are 100, but the green bar doesn't move).\n* Disabled \"Stereo Mix\".\n* Ran the Windows Troubleshooting tool (found nothing, of course).\n\n\n\nMy Setup:\n\n* OS: Windows 10\n* Headset: A HAVIT model (not sure which) with a single 3.5mm TRRS jack (the kind for phones).\n* Connection: I'm using a Y-splitter cable to plug it into the separate mic and headphone jacks on my PC.\n\n**Update**: I've just realized the mic is technically picking up audio, but it's capturing my desktop audio. If I play a YouTube video, people on Discord can hear the video perfectly clear. But they can't hear my voice at all. It's like the mic input is somehow being rerouted to the \"Stereo Mix\" or desktop sound, even though I've tried disabling Stereo Mix.",

Down the road I'd like to think I could throw a new GPU in this in a year or two.\n\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wDPC74)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 4.7 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fPyH99/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-47-ghz-8-core-processor-100-1000001084wof) | $459.98 @ Amazon \n**CPU Cooler** | [Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/hYxRsY/thermalright-peerless-assassin-120-se-6617-cfm-cpu-cooler-pa120-se-d3) | $34.90 @ Amazon \n**Motherboard** | [MSI MAG X870 TOMAHAWK WIFI ATX AM5 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WzzXsY/msi-mag-x870-tomahawk-wifi-atx-am5-motherboard-mag-x870-tomahawk-wifi) | $258.00 @ Amazon \n**Memory** | [G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB 64 GB (2 x 32 GB) DDR5-6000 CL26 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/j7XMnQ/gskill-trident-z5-neo-rgb-64-gb-2-x-32-gb-ddr5-6000-cl26-memory-f5-6000j2636g32gx2-tz5nr) |-\n**Storage** | [Samsung 990 Pro 4 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/RKYmP6/samsung-990-pro-4-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-mz-v9p4t0bw) | $319.99 @ Abt \n**Video Card** | [Asus TUF GAMING OC GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ybjv6h/asus-tuf-gaming-oc-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16-gb-video-card-tuf-rtx5070ti-o16g-gaming) | $849.99 @ Amazon \n**Case** | [Corsair 4000D Airflow ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WBVG3C/corsair-4000d-airflow-atx-mid-tower-case-cc-9011201-ww) | $148.82 @ Amazon \n**Power Supply** | [Corsair SF1000 (2024) 1000 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular SFX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Y4zXsY/corsair-sf1000-2024-1000-w-80-platinum-certified-fully-modular-sfx-power-supply-cp-9020257) | $209.99 @ Newegg \n**Operating System** | [Microsoft Windows 11 Home Retail - USB 64-bit](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/hMYmP6/microsoft-windows-11-home-retail-usb-64-bit-haj-00108) | $137.25 @ Walmart \n**Monitor** | [Asus ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM 26.5\" 3840 x 2160 240 Hz Monitor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/BFG2FT/asus-rog-swift-oled-pg27ucdm-265-3840-x-2160-240-hz-monitor-90lm0b30-b019b1) | $1099.99 @ Amazon \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **$3518.91**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-10-21 16:46 EDT-0400 |\n",

I've heard AMD is currently better than Intel by quite a margin, so I'm leaning toward AMD, but I'm confused about the options.  \nIt looks like the latest generation is the 9000 series (I often see the 9600 and 9600X mentioned), but I still see some posts recommending older chips (7500F, 7700). Why is that?  \nI've also heard about the \"X3D\" series, which I think are designed for gaming. How do they fit into AMD's lineup? When should you choose an X3D CPU, and which model would you pick?  \nOverall, I don't really know how to navigate AMD's offerings.

    "selftext": "My friend made me a question the other day \"which is better 4060 ti 8gb or 9060 xt 8gb?\" I instantly said neither, 8gb of vram is enough and surely there is something better in the used market for that price. But the more I thought about it the less true that became.\n\nIt is true that newer and non optimized titles need more than 8gb, but is there really anything that is equal or better in that 9060 xt 8gb price range? You can find the powercolor model for 270 in amazon. Excluding games that need more than 8gb, it destroys anything else in price to performance. I cant even find an equivalent in the used market for that price.\n\nIf it later in its life drops to around 250, wouldnt it just be the defacto card, the 16gb version is significantly more expensive at 350 USD.\n\nSo, im asking, is it actually that bad? And what price do you think it needs to be to be good?\n\n  \n  \nSome extra stuff. Im thinking of upgrading at some point in the next year and so it my friend, so we are looking for gpus. We have massive import taxes on items over 200. Anything over 200 has a 20% tax added so a 250 USD card becomes a 300 USD so the lower the better. If you have any recommendations for what cards are good right now, new or used im all ears.",

    "selftext": "\nI’m apologizing in advance if this post has the most horrendous format ever, I’m writing this from my phone.\n\nSo last night my cat had zoomies and body slammed into my PC, thus knocking it over. I caught it mid-air so it didn’t make impact to the ground. \n\nI’m a little knowledgeable but not… phenomenally or remarkably, so when I noticed the Bluetooth on my PC was “not turned on” I immediately unplugged it, opened it up and took a look inside.\n\nVisually, nothing looks wrong other than some mild sagging of my GPU, which I fixed by just tightening it back up and I managed to fix the Bluetooth issue by just pressing on it to make sure it was in place, figured it was fixed because everything seemed to be working fine and went to bed.\n\nWoke up this morning, booted it up to work on some things and my keyboard, mouse and headphones were disconnecting and reconnecting every 10-15 seconds and I just now fixed it by simply just plugging them into different ports (still pending testing, who knows at this point, might still be an issue after posting this)\n\nI’ve never had any USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi issues until the fire nation (my cat) attacked last night.\n\nAs of right now, Bluetooth is back to not working. I guess I’m wondering if I need to go back in and look for physical issues again and if so, what should I be looking for??\n\nI have the ASRock A320M/ac, so the Bluetooth/wifi component is built into the motherboard, hence my hesitation to go in there messing with it without some sort of 3rd party insight.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar issue and can point me in the right direction I’d be appreciative.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI went caveman style and started (gently) pushing anything I could see. Booted it up, everything works fine now. I have no idea which component was causing it but I am gonna wait and see if it happens again. For now, it’s running fine and my cat is indefinitely banned from being within 6 feet of my PC.\nHe has no remorse. He screamed in my face earlier.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm completely at my wit's end with a problem and I'm hoping you can help, because I'm all out of ideas.\n\nWe're having a bunch of weird power outages where I live. Yesterday, after one of them, my headset (both audio and mic) stopped working on my PC. No big deal, I just reinstalled the Realtek drivers, and everything went back to normal.\n\nThen today... another outage. This time, only the mic died. The headset audio is perfectly fine, I can hear everything, but nobody can hear me.\n\nThe most important part: I plugged the headset into my tablet, and the mic works perfectly. So the headset itself (it's a HAVIT model) is fine. The problem is 100% on the PC.\n\n\n\nWhat I've already tried:\n\n* Tested both front and rear panel audio jacks.\n* Bought and tested a brand new Y-splitter (it wasn't the adapter).\n* Completely reinstalled/updated audio drivers (Realtek), both via Windows and from the motherboard's official website.\n* Checked all Win10 Privacy settings (mic access is enabled).\n* Checked Sound Control Panel > Recording (mic is default, not muted, levels are 100, but the green bar doesn't move).\n* Disabled \"Stereo Mix\".\n* Ran the Windows Troubleshooting tool (found nothing, of course).\n\n\n\nMy Setup:\n\n* OS: Windows 10\n* Headset: A HAVIT model (not sure which) with a single 3.5mm TRRS jack (the kind for phones).\n* Connection: I'm using a Y-splitter cable to plug it into the separate mic and headphone jacks on my PC.\n\n**Update**: I've just realized the mic is technically picking up audio, but it's capturing my desktop audio. If I play a YouTube video, people on Discord can hear the video perfectly clear. But they can't hear my voice at all. It's like the mic input is somehow being rerouted to the \"Stereo Mix\" or desktop sound, even though I've tried disabling Stereo Mix.",

I bought it around PHP50k / USD960 (conversion back jn 2019) excluding montior, peripherals, storage, and fans, and I'm thinking of spending around PHP30-40k / USD500-700 if I can somehow extend its life to another 3-5 yrs, or until the release of AM6.

I *might* get a better CPU if the bottleneck is massive but the 5800x3d costs at PHP20k/USD350 rn and I don't think it's worth it. Need your inputs\n- RAM: Change to 2x16GB @ 3200 MHz (can't find any 3600 in our current stores) est @ PHP7k/USD120\n- Mobo: No change. Ryzen 5000 series is the highest it can go to\n- PSU: If I can get away with it, I won't be upgrading it. Not planning to OC\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this a good idea?",

This is the same behavior as before I tried anything.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure what else to do at this point besides replace the CPU, motherboard, or AIO, but wanted to see if there's anything else I should try. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "\n\nHello everyone, hope you are having a great day/night. \n\nMy cousin came over the weekend and I played him the 1st hour of clair obscur expedition 33. He is not a big gamer, but he has liked indie titles like little nightmares and we played a demo from reanimal. He appreciates good atmosphere graphics and stories so I knew he would love coe33 as he hasn't played anything similar to it(even if there is anything haha). \n\nHe is now hooked and he just moved into his first house by himself. He doesn't know anything about computers and as I am the one in the family who kinda knows his stuff.\n\n The problem I have when trying to recommend him something though is that I have a 5080 and I play at 1440p While he has a 4k tv that he wants to game on and no GPU that can go near 4k.\n\n His system is an am4 system with a 2600x and 16gigs of ram. Do you think a 5070 with dlss on performance would cut it for 4k clair obscur? Maybe lowering some settings? Will the CPU be able to keep up? 4k is not too tough on the CPU but as the CPU is a bit old I am thinking it might even have trouble with the engine itself. Maybe even ram should be expanded but that is a pretty easy upgrade.\n\nDo you guys think 12gbs for 4k is too low even for lowered settings? I think that my cousin will be satisfied with the fidelity of dlss 4 performance and if his tv goes above 60hz(he doesn't know, I would have to check when I go over)  he can even try out frame gen. He is mostly a controller player so even some extra latency would go unnoticed. Is the 5070 worth considering? \n\nI don't really like the amd side as not many games have fsr 4 compared to dlss 4 and especially at 4k using dlss on performance is a great performance boost while on a budget while also lowering vram requirements.

    "title": "So, what the hell happened to my PC today? It was a very strange and scary experience. Is my PC slowly dying, or does it still have a good life ahead of it?",
    "selftext": "So to start from the beginning, I have a 11th Gen IntelR Core tm 15-11400f @ 2.60 GHz Cpu, 16 gm of ram, a kingston sa2000m8500g  SSD, 1 extermal USB Disk Device and a AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT. \n\nA pretty good PC that I built myself in 2021 for around 1200 euros.\n\n  \nFrom the beginning, I never really had any problems with him. Everything always went well, until over the years, minor problems kept cropping up, which got worse over the years.\n\n  \nIt started with my PC crashing occasionally, because it was too hot or something else. I was also playing several next-gen games at the time, like BF 2042, (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, I think). The final beat. In all of these games, I had problems with my PC. It did its best but still crashed a few times. but in one but only in 2 game i had somting.\n\nbut only in 2 games I had something that came close to what just happened to me like 1 h ago.\n\nEVE Online and Helldivers 2.\n\nIn EVE Online, one day I had blue and green screens of dead out of nowhere. They kept appearing every now and then after that, while I wanted to play other games. After speaking to support and watching several videos that told me my GPS was dying, I simply dusted it off, applied new thermal paste, pressed everything in firmly, and for the last two or three years or so, I haven't had any more of these screens of dead.\n\nI've been playing Helldivers 2 since its release and fought in the war during its dark days, when the game was in poor condition and had frequent PC crashes during that time. But the worst HD2 PC crash I've ever had was when my entire system froze out of nowhere and simply shut down. After that, I couldn't play the game for a few days, but things improved over time after I set all graphics settings to the minimum and played at lower resolutions. ((Funnily enough, I can now play smoothly on maximum graphics settings with a maximum of 60 fps without any issues (apart from the issues the game itself has))\n\nBut the strangest and worst problem I've ever had was today.\n\nI haven't had any problems with my PC in the last few days, weeks, or months. Everything was running fine, except for today. Today, everything was working fine when I went out for a quick smoke. I had my PC turned on while I was doing that (no tabs or games open). When I came back after about 10 minutes, all I saw was that my screen was black and wouldn't work anymore. It restarted automatically. It was on the loading screen and then froze.\n\nI watched it for about a minute and nothing happened. I then manually turned it off. I waited a bit. I turned it on. I started it. And the same thing happened. It froze on the loading screen. After a lot of back and forth of manually turning it off and on again, I got back into my PC until it froze again and restarted on its own. ther was also on time after manually turnig of wher a messige appare on the loding screen wich said,, raparing curupted data,, but this only shod up 1 time. affter some more trys\n\nI turn my PC completely off again, go to Reddit, and look at things that might help me. I also found a post where someone had a similar problem. Someone wrote that they tried different things until they found out that the Logitech driver was causing them problems. Then I remembered that my Logitech driver hasn't been working since Windows 10 will not be updated anye more, and I can't access it at all. He then said that he also unplug a few peripherals to reduce the load on the PC, which is what I did the last times I tried it, but it didn't help much because my PC kept freezing until I uninstalled the Logitech hub and a couple of other things. After that, I completely turned my PC off again, turned it back on, and everything was back to normal. I waited a bit until I reconnected my Perifar devices, but now everything's working fine again, as if nothing had happened. So, could you tell me if my PC is broken or if it still has a good life ahead of it?\n\n\r",

    "selftext": "My friend made me a question the other day \"which is better 4060 ti 8gb or 9060 xt 8gb?\" I instantly said neither, 8gb of vram is enough and surely there is something better in the used market for that price. But the more I thought about it the less true that became.\n\nIt is true that newer and non optimized titles need more than 8gb, but is there really anything that is equal or better in that 9060 xt 8gb price range? You can find the powercolor model for 270 in amazon. Excluding games that need more than 8gb, it destroys anything else in price to performance. I cant even find an equivalent in the used market for that price.\n\nIf it later in its life drops to around 250, wouldnt it just be the defacto card, the 16gb version is significantly more expensive at 350 USD.\n\nSo, im asking, is it actually that bad? And what price do you think it needs to be to be good?\n\n  \n  \nSome extra stuff. Im thinking of upgrading at some point in the next year and so it my friend, so we are looking for gpus. We have massive import taxes on items over 200. Anything over 200 has a 20% tax added so a 250 USD card becomes a 300 USD so the lower the better. If you have any recommendations for what cards are good right now, new or used im all ears.",

    "selftext": "\nI’m apologizing in advance if this post has the most horrendous format ever, I’m writing this from my phone.\n\nSo last night my cat had zoomies and body slammed into my PC, thus knocking it over. I caught it mid-air so it didn’t make impact to the ground. \n\nI’m a little knowledgeable but not… phenomenally or remarkably, so when I noticed the Bluetooth on my PC was “not turned on” I immediately unplugged it, opened it up and took a look inside.\n\nVisually, nothing looks wrong other than some mild sagging of my GPU, which I fixed by just tightening it back up and I managed to fix the Bluetooth issue by just pressing on it to make sure it was in place, figured it was fixed because everything seemed to be working fine and went to bed.\n\nWoke up this morning, booted it up to work on some things and my keyboard, mouse and headphones were disconnecting and reconnecting every 10-15 seconds and I just now fixed it by simply just plugging them into different ports (still pending testing, who knows at this point, might still be an issue after posting this)\n\nI’ve never had any USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi issues until the fire nation (my cat) attacked last night.\n\nAs of right now, Bluetooth is back to not working. I guess I’m wondering if I need to go back in and look for physical issues again and if so, what should I be looking for??\n\nI have the ASRock A320M/ac, so the Bluetooth/wifi component is built into the motherboard, hence my hesitation to go in there messing with it without some sort of 3rd party insight.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar issue and can point me in the right direction I’d be appreciative.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI went caveman style and started (gently) pushing anything I could see. Booted it up, everything works fine now. I have no idea which component was causing it but I am gonna wait and see if it happens again. For now, it’s running fine and my cat is indefinitely banned from being within 6 feet of my PC.\nHe has no remorse. He screamed in my face earlier.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm completely at my wit's end with a problem and I'm hoping you can help, because I'm all out of ideas.\n\nWe're having a bunch of weird power outages where I live. Yesterday, after one of them, my headset (both audio and mic) stopped working on my PC. No big deal, I just reinstalled the Realtek drivers, and everything went back to normal.\n\nThen today... another outage. This time, only the mic died. The headset audio is perfectly fine, I can hear everything, but nobody can hear me.\n\nThe most important part: I plugged the headset into my tablet, and the mic works perfectly. So the headset itself (it's a HAVIT model) is fine. The problem is 100% on the PC.\n\n\n\nWhat I've already tried:\n\n* Tested both front and rear panel audio jacks.\n* Bought and tested a brand new Y-splitter (it wasn't the adapter).\n* Completely reinstalled/updated audio drivers (Realtek), both via Windows and from the motherboard's official website.\n* Checked all Win10 Privacy settings (mic access is enabled).\n* Checked Sound Control Panel > Recording (mic is default, not muted, levels are 100, but the green bar doesn't move).\n* Disabled \"Stereo Mix\".\n* Ran the Windows Troubleshooting tool (found nothing, of course).\n\n\n\nMy Setup:\n\n* OS: Windows 10\n* Headset: A HAVIT model (not sure which) with a single 3.5mm TRRS jack (the kind for phones).\n* Connection: I'm using a Y-splitter cable to plug it into the separate mic and headphone jacks on my PC.\n\n**Update**: I've just realized the mic is technically picking up audio, but it's capturing my desktop audio. If I play a YouTube video, people on Discord can hear the video perfectly clear. But they can't hear my voice at all. It's like the mic input is somehow being rerouted to the \"Stereo Mix\" or desktop sound, even though I've tried disabling Stereo Mix.",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been wondering about this for a while. Why don’t we have headphones that can tell if a sound’s coming from above or below when you tilt your head? It’s pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound’s coming from. I don’t see any technical reason why we can’t have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response – there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "**Greetings, everyone!**\n\nOur upcoming project - a medieval RPG **Legacy of Valor** \\- is on Kickstarter, and we've already surpassed our first stretch goal.\n\nBut first, I'd like to introduce you to the game itself.\n\n**Legacy of Valor** is a medieval RPG that blends **castle building**, **territory management**, **large-scale battles**, and a **story-driven narrative** into one immersive experience. In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Husák! 😊), but soon, **thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his **passion, enthusiasm, and desire** are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Husák himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to **expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile – and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point, **we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that **Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*“Hey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors — If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you’re gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step — launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign — just like old times — and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let’s rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power. Let’s build that castle from the ground up — together.”*\n\nWe can’t express how much this means to us. **Warhorse Studios inspired us** \\- their journey proved that passion, authenticity, and belief in your vision can build something truly remarkable.\n\nThat same spirit drives **Legacy of Valor**. We are going to create a world filled with life, choices, and medieval grit - a place that feels alive, grounded, and shaped by your actions. Let’s carry this legacy forward. **Together!**\n\nKickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total\\_hits=2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legacyofvalorgame/legacy-of-valor-medieval-rpg-build-conquer-rule?result=project&term=legacy%20of%20valor&total_hits=2)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A](https://discord.gg/P57xvp3A)\n\nReddit: [r/Legacyofvalorgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Legacyofvalorgame/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579043977820)\n\nX: [https://x.com/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor](https://x.com/Legacy_of_Valor)\n\nOfficial website: [https://legacyofvalorgame.com/](https://legacyofvalorgame.com/)\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy\\_of\\_Valor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504490/Legacy_of_Valor/)\n\nBest Regards,  \nLegacy of Valor Team",

    "selftext": "I purchased Ryse: Son of Rome on August 29th. This was the first time I ever purchased from Humble Bundle. At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

    "selftext": "**Hey, r/pcgaming!**\n\n**I’m Louis Denizet, game director at** [Hibernian Workshop](https://hibernian-workshop.com/)**, the indie studio behind the roguelite** [Astral Ascent](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280930/Astral_Ascent/) **— and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have!**\n\nI started the studio years ago after meeting Alexandre Magnat online — we were both self-taught and completely obsessed with pixel art, especially the kind you see in anime across different eras and styles. \n\nWhat followed after a few years since this match was Astral Ascent, a colorful, fast-paced roguelite in the vein of Dead Cells with a focus on fluid combat, replayability (with 5 unique characters to choose from), and wrapped up in a pixel art style that’s by now become a signature of our work. \n\nIt wasn’t our first game, but it’s the one where we finally found our footing. A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I’d describe the thematic heart of AA and we’ve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It’s also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we’re still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe’ve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We’ve learned a lot from our past games — Astral Ascent most of all — and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project… which, truth be told, probably won’t be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that’s the short of it about us.\n\nIt’s been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that’s to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We’re excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it’s amazing that AI doesn’t have to be a “bullet” for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

This constant high speeds are starting to show audible wear to the single rear fan in my system.\n\nNotes:  \n• I have my drivers installed  \n• the fans ramping up at all has never been an issue until now.\n\n• I have not checked BIOS\n\n• the rgb in the fans usually reset to default light settings for a few seconds when this happens, app control does not affect the issue (Lenovo Vantage, never much help anyways)\n\n• I suspect a psu related issue, but I haven't been able to check it or its wattage, assume 400w and its struggling to give power.",

    "title": "My theory about what MS actually plans to do with gaming",
    "selftext": "It seems MS got the message they should have gotten years ago with the threat of SteamOS, given how their plans for the future have been ever changing these last years. Given that many people believe their expensive console - multiple stores - hybrid console/PC strategy makes no sense, here I am giving you my 2 cents. \n\nWindows have been known to be sluggish/resource hungry and that is mainly part of the way they are built - which is for being an everything OS that runs from demanding brand-new programs to running a 90s .exe on a hospital in some Balkan country (insert infuriating data collection as well here). No matter what they do, Windows will always be \"slower\" for specific task - in this case gaming - because it caters to many many different use case scenarios. Consoles are made to \"just\" play games (now how well they do that is another convo), so their OS's and programs are being made specifically for that.  Add the fact that they have  a specific HW combo they need to run on and u get much easier lower-level access in your approach on building for them. That's one of the main reasons why these devices do recompiling as well. \n\nThe last couple of years SteamOS arrived and showed that the modularity of Linux, allows Valve to approach their OS as they would do in a console -> far less bloat -> easier lower-level access -> significant perf gains across a multitude of games. The perf diffs are honestly embarrassing for MS, millions of people are using PCs for gaming, and these PCs run Windows. If SteamOS, Bazzite (or any other OS) arise as a truly logical and feasible alternative, then Windows is as good as dead in the long run.\n\nThat is why I believe they are finally starting to take action about this. If Windows lose PC OS market share, then all of their adjacent product sales (and do take into consideration all the data they collect and then sell) will plummet. \n\nSo, here is what I believe they are trying to do, based on what we know (leaks as well): With the next Windows installment - call it Windows 12 or whatever else they will call it - they will \"modulize\" the OS core. The result will be a hybrid core that support both Legacy and standard APIs (Win32 for example) AND a new game core with low-level APIs/toolsets , like the Xbox does. With that, they will be able to improve the gaming part of the OS while not messing with the compatibility of the OS. Game devs will have the option to chose between what they know how to work with (Win32 + DX11/12) or these new toolsets that will be much more performant. The result will be an Xbox interface that truly runs just the part of the OS needed for gaming and a \"seamless\" transition between this gaming environment and full Windows (plus XPA will be standardized, given that every game built will be a PC one). Also, the fact that they are making a line of APUs for next gen of different perf tiers, but with the chiplet design, leads me to believe that they are trying to change the way drivers work as well -> precompiling -> more console-like experience that reduces stuttering.\n\nNow comes the realism part. While this sounds awesome about the future of PC gaming, MS is still, well, MS and they WILL find a way to f this up. From making these toolsets a hustle to use (just like the current Xbox ones), to fumbling this initiative in the most stupid way possible. Let's hope this time they don't...\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’ve got a new PC build and am dealing with a super strange issue.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* GPU: **ASRock RX 9060 XT Challenger 16 GB** (dual-fan)\n* CPU: **Ryzen 9600X**\n* RAM: 32 GB \\*\\*XPG Lancer DDR5-6000\n* Case: **Thermaltake S200** tg  white(compact mid-tower)\n* Cooler: **Thermaltake** astria 200\n* PSU: **XPG Core Reactor 850W Gold**\n* **motherboard: B650 gigabyte gaming series x ax v1.5 (bios up to date)**\n\n**The issue:**  \nWhile playing **Cyberpunk 2077** at max settings, my GPU fans make a **drilling/rubbing-air noise** once they ramp past \\~50-70% (around \\~1500- 2300RPM).  \nBUT:\n\n* The noise does **not** occur in any other game (including heavy ones).\n* The noise also does **not** appear in synthetic benchmarks or stress tests.\n* When I reset everything to default (no custom fan curve, no undervolt) the noise *immediately* disappeared.\n* Under heavy load (two games open at once: Spider‑Man 2 + Monster Hunter Wilds), temps are great (GPU \\~60-66 °C, hotspot \\~86 °C) and fans stay under \\~40%/\\~1300 RPM — no noise.\n* The noise can only be reproduce again if i manually set a custom fan curve that goes beyond 2000 rpm (70%). \n\n**What I tried:**\n\n* Removed leftover plastic film on the GPU cooler.\n* Opened the case (while powered off) and cleaned dust with a microfiber cloth. ( all components are new, i bought it a week ago)\n* Reseated the PSU power cable (after hearing a small “tick/spark” when it wasn’t fully inserted).\n* Switched GPU/PSU/RAM to defaults (no custom curves/no undervolt/ no underclock).\n* Tested other fans (case, PSU) to isolate the noise to the GPU fan area.\n\n**Current verdict:**\n\n* No sign of instability or damage — system is stable.\n* My suspicion: Not a bearing issue (since no mechanical noise at low RPM), but probably a **design or acoustic resonance issue** (fan vs case vs airflow) triggered specifically by Cyberpunk’s load.\n* The store/tech says: unless there’s a **mechanical defect** (fan grinding, wobble) reproducible under standard conditions (no undervolt/underlock nor custom fan curve), they cannot  RMA ( I live in south america) — synthetic tests run fine and other games are quiet.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* Should I just keep using it and monitor?\n* If the fans work perfectly under 40% RPM and temps are fine, is this just a weird design quirk rather than a fault? mabye an airflow issue as the chassis is small?\n* Could long-term use in that noise zone (40-70% RPM) *eventually* harm the fan or GPU cooling, or is it safe since it never actually hits high RPM / high temps?\n\n\\* Thank you in advance. \n\n**TL;DR:**  \nNew RX 9060 XT build—fan noise “drilling” only in Cyberpunk when fans ramp high; resets to default ( no oc/underlock / custom fan curve) eliminate noise; everything else fine.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm completely at my wit's end with a problem and I'm hoping you can help, because I'm all out of ideas.\n\nWe're having a bunch of weird power outages where I live. Yesterday, after one of them, my headset (both audio and mic) stopped working on my PC. No big deal, I just reinstalled the Realtek drivers, and everything went back to normal.\n\nThen today... another outage. This time, only the mic died. The headset audio is perfectly fine, I can hear everything, but nobody can hear me.\n\nThe most important part: I plugged the headset into my tablet, and the mic works perfectly. So the headset itself (it's a HAVIT model) is fine. The problem is 100% on the PC.\n\n**What I've already tried:**\n\n* Tested both front and rear panel audio jacks.\n* Bought and tested a brand new Y-splitter (it wasn't the adapter).\n* Completely reinstalled/updated audio drivers (Realtek), both via Windows and from the motherboard's official website.\n* Checked all Win10 Privacy settings (mic access is enabled).\n* Checked Sound Control Panel > Recording (mic is default, not muted, levels are 100, but the green bar doesn't move).\n* Disabled \"Stereo Mix\".\n* Ran the Windows Troubleshooting tool (found nothing, of course).\n\n**My Setup:**\n\n* OS: Windows 10\n* Headset: A HAVIT model (not sure which) with a single 3.5mm TRRS jack (the kind for phones).\n* Connection: I'm using a Y-splitter cable to plug it into the separate mic and headphone jacks on my PC.\n\nUpdate: I've just realized the mic is technically picking up audio, but it's capturing my desktop audio. If I play a YouTube video, people on Discord can hear the video perfectly clear. But they can't hear my voice at all. It's like the mic input is somehow being rerouted to the \"Stereo Mix\" or desktop sound, even though I've tried disabling Stereo Mix.",

    "selftext": "I used to have an MSI Ventus 2X RTX 5070, but I didn’t really like it because of how it looked. When I bought it, Amazon said it was the only 5070 they could ship to my address  which is actually a courier address since I live in the Dominican Republic.\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw a post on Facebook from what looked like a “shop” selling a 5070 Ti for $473. I immediately got interested and sold my own 5070 the next day for $530, planning to buy the Ti version.\n\nThe shop claimed to be 223 km away. I was even going to make the trip because it was going to be a Saturday  but they told me they closed at 3:30 PM, and I wouldn’t make it there until around 5 PM. They offered to ship it to me instead. I agreed, but they said that since they use a special national courier, I would have to pay the full amount upfront, because once the product is handed over, it’s considered sold.\n\nThey sent me videos of themselves delivering the package to the courier facility, so it looked legit. Two days later, I went to the courier office in my town but they told me there was nothing under my name. They asked for a shipping receipt, so I tried to call and text the “shop”, but they never replied.\n\n**That’s when I realized what had happened.**\n\nWhat’s strange is that they didn’t block me. They even sent videos of their ID and of the guy I was talking to, which made it all seem real. A friend of mine had actually bought a Nintendo Switch from them before but he went in person, so that’s probably why it worked out. It’s weird to me that they scam people online but still seem to operate like a normal shop in person.\n\nI just feel so stupid. I’m only 17, and I can’t get that money back because it was a bank transfer, which makes recovery almost impossible. I’d need to file a police report, hire a lawyer, and go through all that  and I really don’t want my parents spending money to fix a mistake I made.\n\nI feel terrible about it.  \nI don’t know if I should share screenshots or the shop’s name, but I probably won’t.  \nI just wanted to share my experience so others can be careful.",

I currently have a custom build that includes an Intel I7-13700F, an MSI MPG Z790 EDGE WIFI, and an Nvidia RTX 4060. I currently have 32gb (2×16) of Corsair DDR5 RAM on the board because I didn't really see a need for 64gb when I stuck the 4060 in there. I'm currently looking at an RTX 5080 to upgrade to so I want to increase to 64gb of RAM. \n\nSo my question is, will buying two more sticks of 16gb RAM get me the performance I'm looking for, or do I need to bite the bullet and buy 2×32 and keep it dual channel? If the performance difference between 4×16 and 2×32 is marginal, I'm fine with it (four sticks looks cooler imo). I'm just trying to figure out if my CPU will allow it and I've seen different sources say different things. I appreciate the input!",

    "selftext": "I had my MSI 5090 Suprim Liquid for five months without any issues until yesterday. Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA’s foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI’m totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card… \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I’m usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can’t believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately. I’m aware this is an MSI product, but Nvidia insist that every manufacturer uses this horrible connector.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI have reached out to MSI for a warranty claim, but they told me I need to get in touch with my local vendor Scan.\nScan initially accepted the request but wanted me to pay for shipping and insurance of that 8lb box on my own dime, as it is a \"damaged goods return\". And insuring such an expensive box turns out to be quite pricey.\n\nThis morning they suddenly changed their stance and a pre-paid courir will pick it up tomorrow.\nThis is likely due to this post, which I have mentioned in my correspondence with customer support. \n\nI can't thank you enough for all the upvotes and I'll keep you posted on this.\n\n \nRE choice of cable: Many of you have pointed out not to use the included MSI cable and instead the 12v6x2 from my Corsair PSU, which most PSUs won't even provide. When I built the PC I've watched this video https://youtu.be/6FJ_KSizDwM?si=MTw-3uioJ0wdiR_M&t=486 which strongly recommends not to use the Corsair PSU cable because of the bad quality and instead use the MSI cable which was praised for it's quality.\n\nDo with this information what you want, but it seems the current consensus is to use the PSU cable.",

I’m posting here to see if anyone else is running into the same problem or has found a fix.\n\nSystem Specs\n\t•\tCPU: 7800x3d\n\t•\tGPU: AMD Radeon RX 9070XT\n\t•\tStorage: 1 TB NVMe SSD (SMART health: Good)\n\nThe Issue\n•\tThe game launches normally and runs fine for a few matches.\n•\tAfter a couple of rounds, loading into new matches takes several minutes and sometimes freezes entirely.\n•\tTask Manager shows Disk 0 (C:) at 100% Active Time, with read speeds around 12 MB/s and average response times over 1000 ms.\n•\tOnce I quit the game, disk usage instantly drops back to normal and the system is responsive again.\n•\tThis issue doesn’t occur in any other games or applications.\n\nWhat I’ve Tried\n•\tVerified and repaired files in both Steam and the EA App (Steam redownloaded 3 files).\n•\tDisabled and re-enabled Windows services like SysMain and Indexing.\n•\tAdded and later removed Windows Defender exclusions for Battlefield.\n•\tCleared shader caches and temporary files.\n•\tChecked SSD SMART status (healthy).\n•\tUpdated AMD GPU drivers, Windows updates, and SSD firmware.\n•\tReinstalled EA Anti-Cheat.\n•\tThe problem only happens in Battlefield 6.\n\nWhat I’ve Observed\n\nWhen the issue occurs:\n•\tBattlefield6.exe is at the top of the disk usage list.\n•\tAverage response time ranges from 900–1300 ms.\n•\tRead speeds hover around 10–15 MB/s, writes under 1 MB/s.\n•\tOccasionally, EA Anti-Cheat log files grow rapidly during the freeze.\n\nLooking for Input\n•\tHas anyone else seen this high disk usage and latency issue in Battlefield 6?\n•\tDid reinstalling the EA App, updating chipset drivers, or doing a full game reinstall fix it?\n•\tIs this tied to certain maps, shader rebuilds, or Anti-Cheat logging?\n\nAny input from others experiencing this would be helpful. I’m trying to confirm whether this is a Battlefield 6 optimization issue or something environmental.",

Still, bit of a gamble but I rolled the dice. It works perfectly! \n\nI wanted a GPU for hardware acceleration in Plex, something that the GT710 that was in there could not do. No QuickSync either as it's a Ryzen system. I was looking at 1050/TIs because they were around the 50-75 dollar range and I wasn't looking to spend a lot,  so this was quite the find. \n\nSmall issue though, I cannot close the case with the power connected, it's too tall. I have a 180 degree adapter coming, hopefully it's narrow enough to allow me to actually close the system up. ",

It’s weirdly emotional seeing it all together after building it piece by piece. I’ve been testing everything nonstop gaming, editing, stress tests and on the side.

    "title": "My theory about what MS actually plans to do with gaming",
    "selftext": "It seems MS got the message they should have gotten years ago with the threat of SteamOS, given how their plans for the future have been ever changing these last years. Given that many people believe their expensive console - multiple stores - hybrid console/PC strategy makes no sense, here I am giving you my 2 cents. \n\nWindows have been known to be sluggish/resource hungry and that is mainly part of the way they are built - which is for being an everything OS that runs from demanding brand-new programs to running a 90s .exe on a hospital in some Balkan country (insert infuriating data collection as well here). No matter what they do, Windows will always be \"slower\" for specific task - in this case gaming - because it caters to many many different use case scenarios. Consoles are made to \"just\" play games (now how well they do that is another convo), so their OS's and programs are being made specifically for that.  Add the fact that they have  a specific HW combo they need to run on and u get much easier lower-level access in your approach on building for them. That's one of the main reasons why these devices do recompiling as well. \n\nThe last couple of years SteamOS arrived and showed that the modularity of Linux, allows Valve to approach their OS as they would do in a console -> far less bloat -> easier lower-level access -> significant perf gains across a multitude of games. The perf diffs are honestly embarrassing for MS, millions of people are using PCs for gaming, and these PCs run Windows. If SteamOS, Bazzite (or any other OS) arise as a truly logical and feasible alternative, then Windows is as good as dead in the long run.\n\nThat is why I believe they are finally starting to take action about this. If Windows lose PC OS market share, then all of their adjacent product sales (and do take into consideration all the data they collect and then sell) will plummet. \n\nSo, here is what I believe they are trying to do, based on what we know (leaks as well): With the next Windows installment - call it Windows 12 or whatever else they will call it - they will \"modulize\" the OS core. The result will be a hybrid core that support both Legacy and standard APIs (Win32 for example) AND a new game core with low-level APIs/toolsets , like the Xbox does. With that, they will be able to improve the gaming part of the OS while not messing with the compatibility of the OS. Game devs will have the option to chose between what they know how to work with (Win32 + DX11/12) or these new toolsets that will be much more performant. The result will be an Xbox interface that truly runs just the part of the OS needed for gaming and a \"seamless\" transition between this gaming environment and full Windows (plus XPA will be standardized, given that every game built will be a PC one). Also, the fact that they are making a line of APUs for next gen of different perf tiers, but with the chiplet design, leads me to believe that they are trying to change the way drivers work as well -> precompiling -> more console-like experience that reduces stuttering.\n\nNow comes the realism part. While this sounds awesome about the future of PC gaming, MS is still, well, MS and they WILL find a way to f this up. From making these toolsets a hustle to use (just like the current Xbox ones), to fumbling this initiative in the most stupid way possible. Let's hope this time they don't...\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I had my MSI 5090 Suprim Liquid for five months without any issues until yesterday. Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA’s foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI’m totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card… \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I’m usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can’t believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately. I’m aware this is an MSI product, but Nvidia insist that every manufacturer uses this horrible connector.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI have reached out to MSI for a warranty claim, but they told me I need to get in touch with my local vendor Scan.\nScan initially accepted the request but wanted me to pay for shipping and insurance of that 8lb box on my own dime, as it is a \"damaged goods return\". And insuring such an expensive box turns out to be quite pricey.\n\nThis morning they suddenly changed their stance and a pre-paid courir will pick it up tomorrow.\nThis is likely due to this post, which I have mentioned in my correspondence with customer support. \n\nI can't thank you enough for all the upvotes and I'll keep you posted on this.\n\n \nRE choice of cable: Many of you have pointed out not to use the included MSI cable and instead the 12v6x2 from my Corsair PSU, which most PSUs won't even provide. When I built the PC I've watched this video https://youtu.be/6FJ_KSizDwM?si=MTw-3uioJ0wdiR_M&t=486 which strongly recommends not to use the Corsair PSU cable because of the bad quality and instead use the MSI cable which was praised for it's quality.\n\nDo with this information what you want, but it seems the current consensus is to use the PSU cable.",

Still, bit of a gamble but I rolled the dice. It works perfectly! \n\nI wanted a GPU for hardware acceleration in Plex, something that the GT710 that was in there could not do. No QuickSync either as it's a Ryzen system. I was looking at 1050/TIs because they were around the 50-75 dollar range and I wasn't looking to spend a lot,  so this was quite the find. \n\nSmall issue though, I cannot close the case with the power connected, it's too tall. I have a 180 degree adapter coming, hopefully it's narrow enough to allow me to actually close the system up. ",

Every upgrade since then was a slow grind better CPU here, new monitor there, proper cable management (eventually). Last month I finally finished it 4070 Ti, curved display, custom keycaps, even some soft ambient lighting that makes me feel like I actually know what I’m doing. It’s weirdly emotional seeing it all together after building it piece by piece. I’ve been testing everything nonstop gaming, editing, stress tests and on the side. No frame drops, no coil whine, no regrets.  \nAnyone else take the slow route with their setup instead of going all in at once? It makes the final build feel way more personal.",

    "selftext": "Finally got my setup to a place I’m happy with, so figured I’d share. My old chair’s recline mechanism broke and it was basically stuck in full chill mode 24/7. It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

I was able to make the MagSafe mount for $8 and the monitor riser I made myself by using the same dimensions from various manufacturers. \n\nRocking a 34” LG ultra-wide and man I love it. Have basic Logitech pebble key 2 and a Logitech M550.\n\nI’ve got only one cable coming to the Mac which is my HP dock located under my desk (wish I could post more pictures)\n\nGot my DJ mixer up top as I love DJing but since I’m full time school I’ve really been off that and focused on school. Really like my setup I’ve only got one cable coming down which is my power cable and cable management is really clean. This also took me a bit as I was trying to figure out the best solution. My solution was using a server rack cable management module that’s aluminum. \n\n\nPlease critique it and maybe give me possible upgrades or improvements you’d do!",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

Really did not expect that and I admit I didnt do enough research.  \nFeels like i am activating keys just by lightly brushing them so i constantly make errors and press on neighboring keys when I type. So don't make the same mistake as I did if you're a newbie  \nthey sound and feel incredible though! Wish I had gotten the heavier versions.",

    "selftext": "I recently picked up this Hummingbird68 for $49+shipping (30ish bucks to the USA, if I recall) as a way to mess around with an HE Keeb: [https://clickclack.io/products/click-clack-x-kochi-hummingbird68-magnetic-switch-mechanical-keyboard-kit](https://clickclack.io/products/click-clack-x-kochi-hummingbird68-magnetic-switch-mechanical-keyboard-kit)\n\nStock the quality is shocking for the price, the case is well made, feels decent, sounds okay if a bit loud for my tastes, keycaps are solid, ect. The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

    "selftext": "[https://x.com/Guilty\\_Gamer\\_X/status/1980302295247257922](https://x.com/Guilty_Gamer_X/status/1980302295247257922)  \n\\#keebaweek continues, this is week 5. This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper.\n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone as some reccomended it to me but GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust AI 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at an odd location. \n\nWhat other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

With its unique resonance and acoustic profile, it offers a sensation that feels fresh, refined, and completely new to the community.   \nThe result is a typing experience that is denser, more balanced, and richly resonant compared to conventional designs.\n\n**Variants & Pricing**\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate — $99**   \nHigh mass and rigidity deliver a precise, snappy response with a bright, articulate acoustic profile. \n\n* Color experiments so far: Orange, Rose Gold, Silver (brushed)\n* Community input wanted: Final colors are not set — please suggest finishes you’d like to see (e.g., Chrome Silver mirror)\n\n**ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate — $99**   \nSlightly more yielding with natural dampening, producing a warmer, smoother resonance while still benefiting from the 4mm thickness.\n\n**Why 4mm?**\n\nCompared to the standard 1.5mm plate, the Kova Keys – ANSI60 4mm plate provides: \n\n* Greater acoustic depth → tones are less sharp, more controlled\n* Full-spectrum response → low, mid, and high frequencies blend into a more cohesive sound\n* Enhanced stability → firmer key feel, reduced flex without compromising comfort\n\n   \n**Key Features**\n\n* Thickness: 4mm (substantial increase over standard 1.5mm plates)\n* Materials: Aluminum (bright and rigid) or Polycarbonate (smooth and warm)\n* Acoustics: Crisp yet rounded, with a more complete harmonic profile\n* Precision Fit: Tested for popular 60% PCBs and mounting styles\n\n**Photos & Media**\n\nTyping test videos and images are by **GTM Studio** — a Thailand-based keyboard review channel producing great content for the Thai keyboard community.   \nWe’re grateful for their assembly and testing of both the Aluminum and Polycarbonate ANSI60 plates.\n\nPlease support their work: \n\n* [YouTube: u/gtmget](https://www.youtube.com/@gtmget)\n* [Facebook: GTM Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gtmmediastudio/)\n\n**Aluminum**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xQIkCarsM) \n\n* Case: Tofu60\n* Plate: ANSI60 4mm Aluminum Plate\n* PCB: DZ60\n* Stabilizers: Cherry Clip-in (Spacebar) + Designer Studios stabs (rest)\n* Switches: Hyacinth V2\n* Keycaps: Keykobo Violet Aler\n\nNotes:   \nThe aluminum test highlights the snappy, bright acoustic profile that 4mm aluminum produces — crisp and articulate, with excellent stability. \n\nColors shown below: Orange, Rose Gold, and Silver (brushed finishes).   \nWe have also experimented with a Chrome Silver mirror finish (not pictured).   \nIf this finish interests you, please let us know — community feedback will help guide final color choices.\n\n**Polycarbonate (PC)**\n\n**Typing Test Video:** [Watch here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTPZTtVKwAjnTl1PP2dggPbVTwwlVK20/view?usp=sharing)   \n**Plate Video:** [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKb45eaNTqjoMjAYNXSlNoEEJw1Uqkf1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNotes:   \nThe typing test demonstrates the warmer, smoother, and more dampened resonance of the ANSI60 4mm Polycarbonate (PC) Plate compared to the aluminum version.   \nThe result is a softer, more rounded sound profile while retaining the added stability of 4mm thickness.\n\n**We need your input**\n\nWhat do you think of the ANSI60 4mm plate? Please share it in the [**IC form**](https://forms.gle/ZsaGH1xoJMeujo8aA) — that’s where your feedback counts.\n\n**Tell us your picks:**  \n• Layout(s) & PCB(s)  \n• Plate material (Alu / PC)  \n• Colors / finishes\n\n**Finishes in testing:**  \n• Chrome Silver (mirror)  \n• Chrome Gold (mirror)  \n• Rose Gold (brushed)  \n• Silver (brushed)  \n• Orange (brushed)  \n• Other — add it in the form\n\nFinal color selections are still open.  \nYour input will directly shape what becomes available — let us know what finishes and materials you’d like to see.\n\n**About This**\n\nPrototypes (Alu + PC, 4mm) are built and tested.

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

A few of them are close in tone, but I’ve been staring at them too long to know what actually works anymore.\n\nBefore I commit to a final direction (samples are already ordered), I’d really appreciate input on:\n\n• Which of the 6 colourways you guys think works best and would compliment your boards nicely?\n\n• Any suggestions for alternate colours for either the characters themselves or the gradient?\n\n• Any that feel like instant no-gos?\n\nI know loud designs aren’t for everyone, but feedback and input either way is appreciated.\n\nOnce the samples arrive I’ll post real photos - and if they print terribly, I’ll disappear into a hole forever.\n\nCheers",

Not usually a place to go for cheap vintage things as they generally know what's good and price accordingly.  For instance this was right next to a Model M keyboard for $150 which I felt was a little over priced.  Now obviously this will take some work to make it usable.  There are broken rivets so it will need a bolt mod in addition to building a case of some sorts and something to connect to the membrane cables to wire up to a controller.  But the keycaps are very cool and split a spacebar... heck yeah.  For now, it'll sit in the collection as I have a long list of projects to work on.  But someday, this thing will rock again.",

I like hiding a fun 60% build in the 5th slot personally :)\n\nKeyboard Protection:\nStands are stable, support 15 lbs per shelf and have been thoroughly strength tested. Cork pads and silicone bumpers are built into each shelf to ensure boards are fully protected and prevent slippage. The bottom of the stand is also equipped with silicone pads to ensure the stand itself doesn't slide around.\n\nUSB Dongle/Flash Drive Storage:\nOffers USB dongle storage for storing and keeping track of wireless dongles as well as flash drives (28 slots total). Note these are not powered or connected, they are purely for storage. No more mixing up or losing your wireless dongles!\n\nPegboard Slots:\nThe back of the stand is equipped with skadis slots for various purposes. The stands are compatible with a variety of skadis accessories and hooks. There are also two slots on each side of the stand for a side hook/accessory. Be on the lookout for skadis accessories to start showing up on the Clackify store as well!\n\n14 Color Options:\nThere are a variety of color options ranging from simple colors to translucent and even Galaxy (sort of metallic) options.\n\nCustomizations:\nIf you'd like to have anything customized, don't hesitate to reach out! Other colors would be possible, and design tweaks could potentially be made for a small fee. Adding logos is also a possibility.\n\nFree US Shipping:\nKeyboard Stands (and any orders over $75 for that matter) ship free to locations in the US.\n\nMore information and photos can be found here: https://clackify.com/products/clackify-keyboard-stand-4-tier\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

Just thought this was funny)\n\nSaw a listing on the site that I figured had to be a mistake - an Attack Shark M86 tri-mode hot swap keyboard with one of the colour options listed as £3.83, with local shipping.\n\nI’m like “There’s no way they’ll honour that. They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to “dynamat” which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I’ve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that’s ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn’t hard with the tool they provide. I’ve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It’s the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn’t know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn’t reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won’t be my daily driver but it’s a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI’ll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .  everything went smoothly;  no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.  It’s probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and “how to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers” videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).  Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote  - without needing to look at any references during the build.  \n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced — just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;  make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;  checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn—->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys).  \n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:  prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it’s too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you’re probably excited to complete quickly.  The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta’ get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**  if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n   **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;  $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;  unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.  (I’m liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n ",

They’ll either cancel or just ship a cable or something”.\n\nEither way, placed the order anyway on Sunday night (19th), it went through with no issue.\n\nThe order then showed as shipped yesterday, and I’m thinking cool, at least I’ll get *something* for my money, especially as the one I ordered has since had its price corrected and is now saying it does not ship to my location.\n\nLo and behold, they actually honoured the sale and the keyboard arrived today (via Amazon, no less) so I’m probably going to give it to my 14 year old son as his first mech board to play with.",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

Il monitor ha 3 anni.\nÈ iniziato con delle righe orizzontali nella parte alta, da due o tre mesi. Non davano neanche fastidio più di tanto, ma col tempo sono un po’ aumentate. \n\nOra ho comprato un cavo display port, sia per sostituire il cavo hdmi in dotazione che utilizzavo, sia per escludere che si trattasse del cavo, e come potete vedere questo è il risultato. Devo dire che i lampi che vedete dalla gif non li aveva mai fatti, ma dopo un po’ si fermano e rimangono solo le righe. \n\nQuindi mi chiedo, sta peggiorando il monitor oppure è possibile (sperando di no) che si tratti della GPU?\n\nSpero di aver postato nella sezione giusta",

    "selftext": "Currently on an old Aoc FHD 144hz trying to make the jump to a nice looking 1440p monitor, im not deadset on OLED and have also considered the Aoc mini-led q27g3xmn but wouldnt mind spending more as long as its under 600€.\n\n-Usecase is mostly gaming/media consumption\n\n-Games i play varies alot but no comp. FPS\n\n-Preffered refresh rate would be 240 - 280 but 180 should also be fine\n\n-My room dosent get too bright at daytime, so no preference between glossy or coated \n\n-Wouldnt want to spend extra on higher screen size/ultrawide\n\nThe only things im worried about on OLED are brightness, text clarity and VRR flicker (which also effects the mini-led), i've read that QD-OLED usually has better text clarity than WOLED, but its supposed to be improved on with the mo27g28g aswell as brightness.\nUnfamilliar with OLED care features and which one has the better ones.\n\n\nAs for the mini-led, its obviously alot cheaper but also has its fair share of downsides (and upsides) like bad VRR flicker, possibly blacksmearing, lower local dimmingzones than some newer Aoc mini-leds (that arent available in europe i think) and lastly slower response/higher input latency (not a comp. Fps player idk if i should care). Also have heard that they can get quite hot which would be concerning since i usually play for long-ish periods at a time, dont know if thats an OLED problem aswell.\n\nNo knowledge/experience with HDR and HDR ratings, for example the aoc q27g3xmn has a HDR1000 rating vs the mo27g28g with a HDR500 rating, whats the difference? Does it matter alot?\n\n\nWill be building my new pc in the next 1-2 months incase there are any upcoming monitors that come out later this year that i should keep an eye on im open to any suggestions.\n\n\nWould love to hear from people that have one of these models and/or can compare OLED and mini-led from their own experience.\n\nThank you.",

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm actually looking for a gaming monitor for a PS5 Pro on a budget. \n\nI could spend a maximum of around 250 euros (I'm in Italy), and I'm trying to get something that would also work for a future pc build. Something with 165hz or more, a decent HDR for the PS5 and obviously an HDMI 2.1 for VRR. I'm actually having a hard time trying to find something that has some reviews. \n\nI've actually found the new Lenovo Legion 27Q-10, but has zero reviews, because it's pretty new. The other option is the Lenovo Legion R27qe, but some say it has orribile HDR. \n\nSo, i hope you could help me, and sorry for any mistake as English is not my first language!",

However, just last night I was gaming on it and the monitor all of a sudden turned off but would still play sounds and such. I unplugged it and turned it back on, and the blue indicator light started blinking and the screen began to flicker on and off without truly turning on. Since then, I haven't been able to turn it off, and the only way to get it to turn off is by unplugging the power cord. Is there any way to fix this problem?",

    "selftext": "I run 1x 32\" 4K and 2x27\" 1440p monitors. I ideally want 115% for the 4k and 100% for the 1440p monitors, but custom scaling is applied to all monitors. 125% takes away too much real-estate on the 4K, but as a compromise I could live with it if it wasn't for the fact that some apps (mostly office applications) become really blurry on the 1440p monitors, which is a problem when I for example use outlook on one of them to keep track of my emails. Because the blur on my two 1440p monitors make them pretty much useless I just default to 100% on all three which causes eye strain when I use the main 4K monitor. \n\nSeriously, this has been an issue on windows for decades, and it's still a problem, and the fact that Office applications are the most affected by blur just further proves that Microsoft just can't handle scaling at all (don't get me started on the grandma-level \"recommended\" scaling factors...).   \nI currently run Win11. \n\nIs there any plugin or third party software that could fix the sclaing issues? When I search for solutions I couldn't find much at all. \n\n",

    "selftext": "MSI is committed to offering a wide variety of gaming monitors to meet the needs of all kinds of users.\n\nNow, we’re excited to introduce our latest Mini-LED monitors, specially designed for enthusiastic gamers. Powered by advanced Mini-LED technology, these monitors deliver vivid, high-contrast visuals, making them especially ideal for HDR content and immersive gaming experiences.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1jd5uocdwf1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37badcde8916b5a54460b9258f6571ba2dcf5c7\n\n**Mini-LED Backlight with 1152 Local Dimming Zones**\n\nAll three models are equipped with 1,152 full-array local dimming zones, deliver peak brightness of up to 1000 nits, and are VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified for a premium HDR experience with stunning clarity and contrast.\n\nCompared with conventional LCD monitors, the Mini-LED backlight technology provides a reduced halo effect, deeper blacks without being grayish, delivering precise light control and more lifelike, vivid visuals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvkqby5tcdwf1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a175ffc0d2ea17ad8c4faeeb8319e6711f5243\n\n**Quantum Dot Film for Superior Visuals**\n\nThe MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Rapid IPS panels, while the MAG 274QPF X30MV adopts a Rapid VA panel. All of them integrate Quantum Dot film to deliver an exceptional visual and gaming experience.\n\n\\- Rapid IPS / Rapid VA ensure ultra-fast response times, minimizing motion blur and delivering smooth gameplay.\n\n\\- Quantum Dot film expands the color gamut, producing richer, more vibrant colors for stunning image quality.\n\nTogether, they offer a perfect blend of speed, clarity, and color accuracy for both gamers and content creators.\n\n\n\n**Revolutionary Dual Mode for Ultimate Flexibility**\n\nBoth MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Dual Mode, supporting:\n\n·        4K@160Hz for ultra-sharp visuals.\n\n·        FHD@320Hz for ultra-smooth gameplay. \n\nTo make switching effortless, gamers can seamlessly move between AAA titles and competitive FPS games using MSI’s 5-way Navi Key, which allows them to toggle between two modes with a single click.\n\nMSI has also made Dual Mode smarter with AI Dual Mode. This feature detects resolution and refresh rate settings and automatically adjusts to the optimized refresh rate when switching. For example, if you set your monitor to 4K@120Hz, the FHD mode will automatically adjust to 240Hz instead of 320Hz, ensuring a balanced experience without extreme discrepancies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss8zsxuycdwf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3d7faf4171a7e6a1c0c02368dfb61ba6a323d5\n\nLearn more about Dual Mode and other AI features, please visit:\n\n[https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience](https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience)\n\n **Specification:**\n\n|Model|MPG 274URDFW E16M|MAG 274UPDF E16M|MAG 274QPF X30MV|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Size|27\"|27\"|27\"|\n|Resolution|UHD|UHD|WQHD|\n|Resfresh Rate|160Hz|160Hz|300Hz|\n|Dual Mode|FHD 320Hz|FHD 320Hz|N/A|\n|Panel|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid VA with Mini-LED|\n|Local Dimming|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|\n|Quantum Dot|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Brightness (nits)|SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |\n|HDR|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|\n|Response Time|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|\n|Connectivity|1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/98W PD, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x USB 2.0 Type-B |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/15W PD |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (WQHD@300Hz)|\n|Gaming Intelligence App|Support|N/A|N/A|\n|Firmware Update|Support|Support|Support|\n\nFor more information please visit the product pages.\n\nMPG 274URDFW E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274UPDF E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274QPF X30MV: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/)\n\n  \nRelease Date:\n\nThey are now available on the market in US.",

First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters.

[P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

I know some people might say to go for a 1440p monitor with my specs, but I’m gonna be playing games like Fortnite, FC26, GTA 5, Minecraft, Rocket League. Mostly Fortnite, where I care most about my FPS. Unless I can get around 240fps on 1440p with this setup, then I’m probably gonna go with 1080p. I’ve narrowed it down to these 2 monitors, but can’t pick which is better. Asus one is $130, and KTC is $140. Which is better? Thanks",

Devo dire che i lampi che vedete dalla gif non li aveva mai fatti, ma dopo un po’ si fermano e rimangono solo le righe. \n\nQuindi mi chiedo, sta peggiorando il monitor oppure è possibile (sperando di no) che si tratti della GPU?\n\nSpero di aver postato nella sezione giusta",

I’ve replaced all the cords to it and this is still happening. It sounds kinda loud like a fan while it is running for awhile. Does anyone have any experience with this monitor, I’ve checked stores online and it says it’s discontinued. What could this issue be ? I don’t really want to buy a new monitor this one was pricey. Anything I can do to fix it ? ",

Something with 165hz or more, a decent HDR for the PS5 and obviously an HDMI 2.1 for VRR. I'm actually having a hard time trying to find something that has some reviews. \n\nI've actually found the new Lenovo Legion 27Q-10, but has zero reviews, because it's pretty new. The other option is the Lenovo Legion R27qe, but some say it has orribile HDR. \n\nSo, i hope you could help me, and sorry for any mistake as English is not my first language!",

    "selftext": "MSI is committed to offering a wide variety of gaming monitors to meet the needs of all kinds of users.\n\nNow, we’re excited to introduce our latest Mini-LED monitors, specially designed for enthusiastic gamers. Powered by advanced Mini-LED technology, these monitors deliver vivid, high-contrast visuals, making them especially ideal for HDR content and immersive gaming experiences.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1jd5uocdwf1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37badcde8916b5a54460b9258f6571ba2dcf5c7\n\n**Mini-LED Backlight with 1152 Local Dimming Zones**\n\nAll three models are equipped with 1,152 full-array local dimming zones, deliver peak brightness of up to 1000 nits, and are VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified for a premium HDR experience with stunning clarity and contrast.\n\nCompared with conventional LCD monitors, the Mini-LED backlight technology provides a reduced halo effect, deeper blacks without being grayish, delivering precise light control and more lifelike, vivid visuals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvkqby5tcdwf1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a175ffc0d2ea17ad8c4faeeb8319e6711f5243\n\n**Quantum Dot Film for Superior Visuals**\n\nThe MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Rapid IPS panels, while the MAG 274QPF X30MV adopts a Rapid VA panel. All of them integrate Quantum Dot film to deliver an exceptional visual and gaming experience.\n\n\\- Rapid IPS / Rapid VA ensure ultra-fast response times, minimizing motion blur and delivering smooth gameplay.\n\n\\- Quantum Dot film expands the color gamut, producing richer, more vibrant colors for stunning image quality.\n\nTogether, they offer a perfect blend of speed, clarity, and color accuracy for both gamers and content creators.\n\n\n\n**Revolutionary Dual Mode for Ultimate Flexibility**\n\nBoth MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Dual Mode, supporting:\n\n·        4K@160Hz for ultra-sharp visuals.\n\n·        FHD@320Hz for ultra-smooth gameplay. \n\nTo make switching effortless, gamers can seamlessly move between AAA titles and competitive FPS games using MSI’s 5-way Navi Key, which allows them to toggle between two modes with a single click.\n\nMSI has also made Dual Mode smarter with AI Dual Mode. This feature detects resolution and refresh rate settings and automatically adjusts to the optimized refresh rate when switching. For example, if you set your monitor to 4K@120Hz, the FHD mode will automatically adjust to 240Hz instead of 320Hz, ensuring a balanced experience without extreme discrepancies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss8zsxuycdwf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3d7faf4171a7e6a1c0c02368dfb61ba6a323d5\n\nLearn more about Dual Mode and other AI features, please visit:\n\n[https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience](https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience)\n\n **Specification:**\n\n|Model|MPG 274URDFW E16M|MAG 274UPDF E16M|MAG 274QPF X30MV|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Size|27\"|27\"|27\"|\n|Resolution|UHD|UHD|WQHD|\n|Resfresh Rate|160Hz|160Hz|300Hz|\n|Dual Mode|FHD 320Hz|FHD 320Hz|N/A|\n|Panel|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid VA with Mini-LED|\n|Local Dimming|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|\n|Quantum Dot|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Brightness (nits)|SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m² HDR: 1000 cd/m² (Peak) |\n|HDR|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|\n|Response Time|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|\n|Connectivity|1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/98W PD, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x USB 2.0 Type-B |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/15W PD |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI™ 2.1 (WQHD@300Hz)|\n|Gaming Intelligence App|Support|N/A|N/A|\n|Firmware Update|Support|Support|Support|\n\nFor more information please visit the product pages.\n\nMPG 274URDFW E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274UPDF E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274QPF X30MV: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/)\n\n  \nRelease Date:\n\nThey are now available on the market in US.",

FPS\n\n-Preffered refresh rate would be 240 - 280 but 180 should also be fine\n\n-My room dosent get too bright at daytime, so no preference between glossy or coated \n\n-Wouldnt want to spend extra on higher screen size/ultrawide\n\nThe only things im worried about on OLED are brightness, text clarity and VRR flicker (which also effects the mini-led), i've read that QD-OLED usually has better text clarity than WOLED, but its supposed to be improved on with the mo27g28g aswell as brightness.\nUnfamilliar with OLED care features and which one has the better ones.\n\n\nAs for the mini-led, its obviously alot cheaper but also has its fair share of downsides (and upsides) like bad VRR flicker, possibly blacksmearing, lower local dimmingzones than some newer Aoc mini-leds (that arent available in europe i think) and lastly slower response/higher input latency (not a comp. Fps player idk if i should care). Also have heard that they can get quite hot which would be concerning since i usually play for long-ish periods at a time, dont know if thats an OLED problem aswell.\n\nNo knowledge/experience with HDR and HDR ratings, for example the aoc q27g3xmn has a HDR1000 rating vs the mo27g28g with a HDR500 rating, whats the difference? Does it matter alot?\n\n\nWill be building my new pc in the next 1-2 months incase there are any upcoming monitors that come out later this year that i should keep an eye on im open to any suggestions.\n\n\nWould love to hear from people that have one of these models and/or can compare OLED and mini-led from their own experience.\n\nThank you.",

Devo dire che i lampi che vedete dalla gif non li aveva mai fatti, ma dopo un po’ si fermano e rimangono solo le righe. \n\nQuindi mi chiedo, sta peggiorando il monitor oppure è possibile (sperando di no) che si tratti della GPU?\n\nSpero di aver postato nella sezione giusta",

That being said, the design wasn’t my favorite. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack location felt awkward, the rotation limiter that attaches on the side felt like an afterthought, and the driver cap, although unique, looked a little weird. \n\nTaking some not-so-subtle design cues from the Dahlia and Tungsten, this was my attempt to solve all those aesthetic issues. Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "title": "Audiophile Verdict of Bose QC Ultra 2 Headphones: DO NOT BUY 1ST GEN!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

I'm attaching a screenshot of what I currently use.\n\n**Reason:**\n\n**Assetto Corsa Competizione** **simulator** doesn't implement helmet attenuation or barely car body attenuation.\n\nTrivia:\n\nWith the spirit of absolute travesty gaming audio still is ACC, as most games, doesn't even have a separate headphones mix, even as an attempted hack...\n\nHardware:\n\nCreative G6\n\nAI output:\n\n1. Please rewrite all of the above ignoring speech. There is no speech nor even radio involved. Just audio as heard inside the car.\n\nThis guide focuses entirely on the acoustic characteristics of a full racing car helmet and how to simulate them through audio equalization, without involving any speech or radio content.\n\n# Step 1: Frequency Response Focus\n\n|**Frequency Range**|**Effect**|\n|:-|:-|\n|20–100 Hz|Slight cut (\\~–2 dB) to remove boomy low-frequency resonances caused by the helmet cavity|\n|100–300 Hz|Mild boost (+1 to +2 dB) to simulate slight resonance peaks inside the helmet|\n|300–1 kHz|Neutral or minor enhancement (+1 dB) to preserve general acoustic presence|\n|1–4 kHz|Moderate attenuation (–2 to –5 dB) to emulate muffled direct midrange frequencies|\n|4–10 kHz|Strong attenuation (–6 to –12 dB) to reflect the high-frequency damping of the helmet shell|\n|10–20 kHz|Maximal cut (–12 dB or more) to simulate absorption of high treble and environmental detail|\n\n# Step 2: EQ Curve Description\n\n1. **Low-Mids (100–500 Hz)**: Slight boost to maintain warmth of in-helmet sound.\n2. **Mids (500 Hz–1 kHz)**: Preserve presence; avoid excessive cuts.\n3. **High-Mids and Highs (2–20 kHz)**: Progressive roll-off starting around 3–4 kHz and reaching maximum around 10–15 kHz to emulate muffling.\n4. **Optional Resonance Peaks**: Boost minor peaks near 200–400 Hz for realistic helmet resonance artifacts.\n\n# Step 3: Practical EQ Bands\n\n* **Band 1:** 100–300 Hz, Q ≈ 1.0, +2 dB\n* **Band 2:** 1–4 kHz, Q ≈ 1.0, –3 dB\n* **Band 3:** 4–10 kHz, Q ≈ 0.7–1.2, –6 to –12 dB (shelving filter)\n* **Band 4:** 10–20 kHz, Q ≈ 0.7, –12 dB (optional)\n* **Low-pass filter:** Optional 6–12 dB/octave starting \\~3–4 kHz for smoother high-frequency damping.\n\nAvoid aggressive low-mid cuts to maintain natural resonance inside the helmet.\n\n",

This buzzing remains until I go to bed, but then goes away by the time I wake up.\n\nHowever, if I use the same headphones without the ANC on this does not happen. (Or at least not nearly as much?)\n\n  \nSooo, does anyone have any intel on cases like this? Anything that can be done? Has there been any formal research on this?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",

When I first tested these on a song Call me now by INNA and Michael Calfan, compared to my Pros 2, the punch of bass disappeared, and things sounded narrow like diffuse field-based tuning or Moondrop VSDF Tuning—also with the fact that her voice got really sharp.\n\nHowever, with the AirPods Pros 3, good Adaptive noise cancellation and the feature to turn off after you fall asleep, and 8 hours of battery life, along with its bass response and resonance peak. This may sound weird, but I have been listening to Sydney Sweeney jeans ads and a couple of whisper ASMR content. Pros 3 actually sounded excellent for this content, allowing me to listen to low volume with this content having that satisfying feeling that I can't describe. Like whisper sounded crisper and more delightful. I assume this is due to the \"vivid vocal clarity\" claim that Apple made. Can anyone relate?",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, £16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

    "selftext": "So, I’ve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn’t stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it’s no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they’d be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they’re better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they’re still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I’m really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say “sufficient”) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an “active analog mode” which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you’re looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC… look no further!",

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

The goal was just to prove the concept.\n\nThey’re also super light (25 grams), which is actually lighter than the cable itself 😄\n\nI’d love to hear what you think or answer any questions about the build!",

    "title": "Had an opportunity to try the LCD-X, & my comparisons to the Edition XS.",
    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisnæs Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told £1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "I'm new to tube amps, especially OTL. Pictured here are the Sennheiser HD 660s (150 Ohm) and the Woo Audio WA3 (advertised 30-600 Ohm output impedance). I understand that, very very simply, the idea of higher impedance headphones is to allow higher fidelity if powered correctly. But would a somewhat lower 150 Ohm set like this still get a lot out of the WA3? I know I'm overcomplicating this since, yes, I do enjoy the sound quality as is, but would I make marked gains with something higher, like even a 300 Ohm HD 650? Thanks in advance.",

    "title": "That Moment When Grado Changed Everything ⚡",
    "selftext": "\nI still remember it like it was yesterday—walking into that audiophile shop in Paris and discovering the Grado 225e for the first time.\n\nI was blown away. Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are— 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it—do yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say — these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural — vocals, instruments, bass — nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven’t noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it’s natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head — soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn’t use them for workouts (they’re not built for that kind of movement), but they’re fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal — so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you’re in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you’ve already paired — that’s super convenient. Battery life is great too — around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere’s also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I’ve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I’ve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They’re not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they’re absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/54k4w3xergwf1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50bfa2b989f0b1b3e504b54df97f787c59d641bb\n\nI was one of the first people who bought the QC Ultra 1 when it released. I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

This buzzing remains until I go to bed, but then goes away by the time I wake up.\n\nHowever, if I use the same headphones without the ANC on this does not happen.

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

Start of 2025 I pressed reset on my 14 pair collection. I was wearing maybe 5 pairs monthly and all the others were just collecting dust. So I got rid of them all. \n\nI wanted to rediscover how it felt to enter the hobby once again this time knowing what I like and how I've changed. I also wanted to explore all of these OG brands that have all these prestige having been a chifi guy.\n\nI picked each of these up £50 from eBay. K550 and ad500x. Sitting down EQ, pads and cable mod. It has been so much more fun and satisfying. I feel like I helped make them show their soul. They also sound great. ",

That being said, the design wasn’t my favorite. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack location felt awkward, the rotation limiter that attaches on the side felt like an afterthought, and the driver cap, although unique, looked a little weird. \n\nTaking some not-so-subtle design cues from the Dahlia and Tungsten, this was my attempt to solve all those aesthetic issues. Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I wanted to say thank you to everyone who congratulated me in my previous post, it was very nice. \n\nTo be clear, this game is free, it has no additional costs, no paid DLC, no commercials, nothing. I simply wanted to make this game and now I hope people are willing to play it because there went a lot of work into making it. I rather see 100 players instead of 10 paid players. \n\nI started making this back in 2012, so basically it was more than 10 years in development. But I made it while I was studying and working.

But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale. Added a Ugreen dock and USB-C switch (like the old-days KVM interfaces) for my mouse and keyboard (to be shared between my 8 year old Windows laptop and the new Steam Deck \"desktop\".\n\nI set the external display as primary and set it to 1440p 144 Hz. Super crisp and fluid. But.... it has some stuttering and hiccups. I eventually reduced it to 120 Hz and it seemed more stable.\n\nFor those of you that use the Deck in a dock, as a desktop, what was the sweet spot for you in terms of resolution and refresh rate, for it to behave nicely?\n\nEDIT: not going to try and play at 1440p, guys, just to use it as desktop for browsing, office work, etc.",

I was so happy, but the interface was so slow and 5 minutes later it shut down and returned to no image/haptics and fans on. \n\nSo, does anyone know what could I do?, I live in MX so there is no option for an RMA, and so far I have tried:\n\nBattery storage mode. \n\nManual Battery storage mode (Vol up + three dots + power) \n\nAccessing Bios (because of no image, this doesn't work) \n\nDraining battery to 0 and then charging with official charger (nothing, but now with new battery maybe something might change?\n\nThe only thing that worked was physically disconnecting the battery l, but I'm a bit hesitant to open the deck so soon after just doing so. \n\nAnyone can help?

The audio will be in sync for all the displays (tried 5 so far.) \n\nFirst install Decky on your Steam Deck. \nThe link is below. \n\nhttps://decky.xyz/\n\nThen install the Sunshine Plugin. \nYou'll have to go into desktop mode to install Sunshine first before being able to use the Decky Plugin. \n\nWith that done. Setup Artemis (Moonlight port) test the connection to make sure that it works. \n\nThen on the other screens make sure you can run Artemis on it (Android set top box or projector will be fine) Doesn't have to be powerful. \n\n\nI've tried it on a Pi but it lagged too much. 😭\n\nRun Artemis put in your Steam Decks IP and it  should appear. \n\nOnce that is running. Connect your Sonos up via Bluetooth. Then change the audio output to your speaker. Its automatically set to Sync Sunshine. \n\nThen go into the settings of the SONOS app, select all the speakers and it should play through all the speakers. ",

    "selftext": "The other day, I decided to get a 512GB microSD card for my Steam Deck, to put a bunch of my smaller games on. That way I'd have more room for larger games on the internal SSD.\n\nI went into Settings > Storage, formatted the microSD card, then used the \"move content\" option on some smaller games, including LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4. The whole point was to make room for some larger games, and since I was using SteamOS' built-in tool to move the games I figured I'd be safe to do this. So at the time, it seemed like a better idea than installing the larger games onto the microSD card.\n\nWhen I decided to play LEGO Harry Potter today, I noticed that the game was fully reset. I got thrown into the initial cutscene again, and instead of being in year 2, I now get the message that I have no save files.\n\nIs there any way to recover the save files, or do I have to start all the way from the beginning again?\n\nUPDATE: I've been trying to troubleshoot based on info I found in a Reddit thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/p64sxcj0ra). In Home/.local/share/Steam/userdata I can't find any directory with the game ID for LEGO Harry Potter (21130?), under Home/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/21130 I only find files that were created or modified today, no older files, so my save data isn't in there either.",

    "selftext": "Kind of a noob question, but I'm curious of the quality of Remote Play over a local network as well as with resolution output.  \n\nFor context, I used to have my PC and TV in the same room and used my 4k tv as a second monitor which I would play games on via Big Picture Mode.  I recently moved and now my TV is in the living room and PC is in the office.  I kind of got used to playing my PC on my couch and find it hard to go back to the computer desk for a lot of games.\n\nI was thinking of moving my PC to my living room but then I would lose the desktop setup for other games (FPS etc)  I saw that the Steam Deck has a dock which connects to HDMI which might be the solution I'm looking for.  While I like the portability of the Deck, I'm wondering if I can just use it as an access point to my PC and connect it to the TV while using controller or mouse and keyboard to game from my living room (basically using it as a replacement for Big Picture Mode). \n\nWould the Steam Deck be worth the price if I mainly use it docked to stream my PC to my TV?  I'm afraid of the latency while playing over a wifi network as well as upscaling the resolution to 1440 or 4k.  I feel like this would be a considerable downgrade from using the TV as a monitor but maybe I'm wrong?  Does anyone else use their Deck this way?\n\nThanks!",

I've tried to use an older version of Proton, but that causes the game font to dissapear and disable the effects of the scripts folder, the game only launches correctly with Proton Hotfix or Experimental.\n\nI've also tried to add a dxvk.conf file that could help to translate the directx code to Vulcan, but it also didn't work.\n\nI'm using a pre-installed version of the game that I had on my windows PC that has a few scripts installed (widescreen fix, extra options, custom hud), but a fresh install of the game ends up having the same problem.\n\nHas anyone of you had a similar problem like this? Any idea what could be the cause of this and if it is possible to solve it?\n\nPlease, I'm at the edge of giving up, any advice that you think would be useful, write it in the comments, thank you.",

I got it yesterday as part of my job (I'm a developper). While I started setting it up, I had really hard time getting passed the wifi connection. Each time I was trying to connect, it failed and after a single attempt, the driver was seemingly borked as it stopped seeing every networks after that attempt. I needed each time to hard reset the console with the '...' option while rebooting.\n\nUntil I had the idea that my SSID (wifi name) was the culprit. Apparently, the Deck doesn't like at all having apostrophes in the SSID, it seemingly borks the driver, so avoid stuff like \"C'pas d'tes affaires\", which in french means \"It's none of your buisiness\".\n\nApart from that, holy cow, it's insane to play WoW Classic on this device with the Console Port Addon... <3\n\nCheers!",

    "selftext": "I know this sort of thing is talked about a lot. But I cannot wrap my head around a lot of the nuances of this. First, just the setup is confusing. I want to use this straight out of the ES-DE frontend and I'm seeing conflicting info on the narrative, ie. \"Here's how to do it,\" vs. \"Simply use the flatpak/native version, through EmuDeck is shitty.\" I'll do whatever allows for the most optimal, user-friendly and robust selection. \n\nThe first thing I think I want to be armed with is the knowledge of what roms require accompanying files (chd and the like), because from what I've seen for most depositories, it makes it seem like all of these require a heck of a lot of files to run (audio and whatnot) so if there's a simplified version of a tutorial out there to help familiarize with this and understand which games require what and what kinds need to be split, etc. that would be very helpful.\n\nI followed this guide (https://youtu.be/HY7eUwhC9g8?si=cYE-8mGnaANxlotn) up to the point where he uses Steam Rom Manager but realized first off that this must be an older version because mine doesn't look like that and that I don't have all these options, and second that only the \"MAME 2003\" option comes up in the parser and since I don't have any of the other MAME options in the tutorial pop up, I'm kind of at a loss of where to go from here. Also, this guide makes it sound like the only real way to get every game working without a hitch is to go straight through Steam Rom Manager. Is that really true? If so I accept it but that's definitely not appealing. Mostly I need to figure out how to get all the different versions of MAME I apparently need to run everything, and through EmuDeck it doesn't seem like I have the option like the guy who did this tutorial did and that has me scratching my head.\n\nThe following guide (https://youtu.be/bCGvC-p7-Sk?si=K8xlLHwFWSr_EU-k) helped me understand some of what to do after getting it working to configure it but I obviously haven't gotten that far yet and want to know if this will be sufficient enough for configuring it on the deck.\n\nLastly, I'm mainly looking to play 90's era fighters and side scrollers like KI, MK and Street Fighter) compared to the older stuff from the 80's. Are there romsets available for stuff like this? That seems like another complex thing and the tutorial seemed to focus on individual roms so that's another point of confusion for me.\n\n\nI know this is a lot. Thanks for any and all help.",

I’m not a Windows guy so I wouldn’t really use it for stuff.   Steam library is over 250 games.   Any console games would be very choosey as I coudln’t afford to drop $80 per title.\n\nLower cost of entry for console but costly to buy content.\n\nLaptop is costly for entry but cheaper games and probably more choices in the grand scheme of things.  There are a lot of titles I’d love to run that Steam Deck wouldn’t and a fully decked out 5080 would run it with very satisfying details.\n\nIs this a no brainer?",

My gaming PC is pretty powerful, and I’m wondering if there’s any benefit to cranking up the resolution and settings on the PC side — like 4K, Ultra graphics, and high frame rates — when streaming to the Deck.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n* Will I *see* any difference if the Deck’s screen is limited to 800p/60fps?\n* Is it better to cap the PC at 1080p/60fps to match the Deck’s capabilities?\n* When streaming, do you notice any visual difference between Medium, High, and Ultra settings?\n* Or is it best to keep things low and efficient for smoother performance?\n\nI’m trying to find the sweet spot between visual quality and streaming performance. Any tips or experiences would be super helpful!\n\nThanks in advance 🙌",

    "title": "Share files from Linux Fedora to Steam Deck using Samba folder share",
    "selftext": "# Intro\n\nI had a hard time getting a local network share working between my Linux Fedora (42, KDE Desktop) PC and Steam Deck. The built-in KDE Plasma Samba GUI tools didn’t work for me at all (shares not visible on Steam Deck, shared folder login loops, etc.), and all Linux-to-Linux sharing tutorials failed me too (and I read/watched many).\n\nEven though Samba is mainly used for sharing with MS Windows, I decided to try it for this Linux to Linux integration, because I had no issues sharing from a **Windows PC to Steam Deck** earlier. After days of trying other methods on Linux Fedora, Samba was the only one that worked for me. As a bonus, you should see the shared folder on Windows PCs too.\n\n# Result of the guide is\n\n* Steam Deck automatically sees your shared folder in Network view (in Dolphin)\n* You can pin your shared folder in Places (in Dolphin on Steam Deck) for easy use\n* Clicking the shared folder (in Dolphin on Steam Deck) prompts for password and opens correctly\n* Works for internal or external (also NTFS) drives on source machine\n* No extra setup or services need to be installed on Steam Deck (was important for me)\n\n>Disclaimer: Use this guide at your own risk. I take no responsibility for anything on your side getting broken by following this guide. I’m new to Linux (about a week in), so this guide may very well not be perfect. It works for me, but I welcome any feedback!\n\nIn all the examples below:\n\n* My **Linux** **username** is `luke`\n* My **Linux machine hostname** is set to `luke-fedora`\n* Replace these with your own username and hostname where needed.\n\n**Warning**: Your Linux PC and Steam Deck must be connected to the same network. Otherwise, this guide will not work for you.\n\n# 0. Set a static hostname (on Linux PC)\n\nThis allows to use static name instead of IPs which might change over time and break your share.\n\n**Verify current hostname:**\n\n    hostnamectl\n\nIf the static hostname is already set, note down the existing value. If it’s not set (i.e., the static hostname is unset), set a new static hostname using the following command.\n\n**Set a static hostname:**\n\n    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname luke-fedora\n\n# 1. Install and enable Samba (on Linux PC)\n\nSamba is an open-source software suite that allows file and print sharing between different operating systems, most notably between Linux/Unix and Windows, but comes to the rescue in this situation too.\n\n    sudo dnf install -y samba samba-client samba-common\n    sudo systemctl enable --now smb nmb\n    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba\n    sudo firewall-cmd --reload\n\nThe last two commands allow Samba communication on firewall level. Share didn't work for me without that.\n\n# 2. Allow Samba to access mounted drives (on Linux PC)\n\nThis step is **optional** and is likely only needed if you have your files on a separate drive. In my case, I have some of my files on a separate NTFS drive.\n\n**Please note that this weakens security restrictions for Samba, so use only if the share does not work otherwise.**\n\n    sudo setsebool -P samba_export_all_rw on\n\nIf you skipped this optional step initially and later decided to try it as a fix for not working shares, I recommend restarting Samba after running the above command (See \"Restart Samba\" in this guide).\n\n# 3. Add your Linux user to Samba (on Linux PC)\n\nIt is important to use your Linux username as Samba username. The Linux username is the one you see in the beginning of every line in command prompt - I see `luke@fedora:\\~$`, so my username is \"luke\". They must match exactly and are case-sensitive.\n\nThe first command will prompt you for a password, the password does not need to match your Linux user password. Note that down, you will need it later to access the shared folder from Steam Deck side.\n\n    sudo smbpasswd -a luke\n    sudo smbpasswd -e luke\n\n# 4. Configure /etc/samba/smb.conf (on Linux PC)\n\nEdit the config:\n\n    sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nNote: You can also just open the above file (`/etc/samba/smb.conf`) in a text editor for convenience.\n\n**Minimal working configuration:**\n\nI just replaced the whole file content with the below for my use-case:\n\n    [global]\n        workgroup = WORKGROUP\n        server string = Fedora Samba Server\n        security = user\n        map to guest = never\n        ntlm auth = yes\n        server min protocol = SMB2\n        client min protocol = SMB2\n        client max protocol = SMB3\n    \n    [<name for your share>]*\n        path = <path to the folder you want to share>**\n        browseable = yes\n        read only = no\n        guest ok = no\n        valid users = luke\n        force user = luke\n        force group = luke\n        create mask = 0664\n        directory mask = 0775\n\n\\* Replace the name in brackets with whatever you want, I used `files`. I recommend using a simple name here, no spaces, no special chars, etc. It will be a part of the shared folder's network address.\n\n\\*\\* Replace the path with your own. For me, I used `/run/media/luke/FILELIB/files`.\n\nSave and exit the file. If you opened it via nano in console, use:\n\n* Hit `Ctrl+O` to prompt writing changes\n* Hit `Enter` to confirm writing changes\n* Hit `Ctrl+X` to close the file\n\n**Restart Samba:**\n\n    sudo systemctl restart smb nmb\n\n# 5. Enable hostname discovery (on Linux PC)\n\n    sudo dnf install -y wsdd\n    sudo systemctl enable --now wsdd\n\nNote: Again, this is MS Windows related, but is likely necessary since we are using Samba. I was not able to Samba share from Linux Fedora to Steam Deck without this step.\n\n# 6. Connect from Steam Deck\n\nIn **Dolphin (File Manager) on Steam Deck:**\n\n* **Address bar:** `smb://luke-fedora/files`\n* **Username:** `luke`\n* **Password:** *(the Samba password you set when prompted)*\n* **Domain:** *(leave blank if shown)*\n\nIn **Address bar** \\-`luke-fedora` matches the Linux PC static hostname you set earlier, `files` matches the name of share in `smb.conf` (within the square brackets).\n\n**Username** Matches your Linux username and also Samba username.\n\nYou can now add the folder to **Places** for a permanent shortcut and you are done!",

It's nice and smooth and such a great user interface.  \nI've used all kinds of Windows and MacOS (former OSX) systems. But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale. Added a Ugreen dock and USB-C switch (like the old-days KVM interfaces) for my mouse and keyboard (to be shared between my 8 year old Windows laptop and the new Steam Deck \"desktop\".\n\nI set the external display as primary and set it to 1440p 144 Hz. Super crisp and fluid. But.... it has some stuttering and hiccups. I eventually reduced it to 120 Hz and it seemed more stable.\n\nFor those of you that use the Deck in a dock, as a desktop, what was the sweet spot for you in terms of resolution and refresh rate, for it to behave nicely?\n\nEDIT: not going to try and play at 1440p, guys, just to use it as desktop for browsing, office work, etc.",

I recently moved and now my TV is in the living room and PC is in the office.  I kind of got used to playing my PC on my couch and find it hard to go back to the computer desk for a lot of games.\n\nI was thinking of moving my PC to my living room but then I would lose the desktop setup for other games (FPS etc)  I saw that the Steam Deck has a dock which connects to HDMI which might be the solution I'm looking for.  While I like the portability of the Deck, I'm wondering if I can just use it as an access point to my PC and connect it to the TV while using controller or mouse and keyboard to game from my living room (basically using it as a replacement for Big Picture Mode). \n\nWould the Steam Deck be worth the price if I mainly use it docked to stream my PC to my TV?  I'm afraid of the latency while playing over a wifi network as well as upscaling the resolution to 1440 or 4k.  I feel like this would be a considerable downgrade from using the TV as a monitor but maybe I'm wrong?  Does anyone else use their Deck this way?\n\nThanks!",

Setup Artemis (Moonlight port) test the connection to make sure that it works. \n\nThen on the other screens make sure you can run Artemis on it (Android set top box or projector will be fine) Doesn't have to be powerful. \n\n\nI've tried it on a Pi but it lagged too much. 😭\n\nRun Artemis put in your Steam Decks IP and it  should appear. \n\nOnce that is running. Connect your Sonos up via Bluetooth. Then change the audio output to your speaker. Its automatically set to Sync Sunshine. \n\nThen go into the settings of the SONOS app, select all the speakers and it should play through all the speakers. ",

These are the layout dimensions:\nTop Screen:\nX Position: 4px\nY Position: 0px\nWidth: 1275px\nHeight: 400px\n\nBottom Screen:\nX Position: 4px\nY Position: 402px\nWidth: 1275px\nHeight: 398px\n\nI did the best I could to fill the screen but I think it's good.

I chose to open it and noticed there there was now a spicy pillow inside my deck, so I changed it.\n\nBut the other problem remains, it still won't turn on, the fans engage, not as fast as with the old spicy pillor, but they turn on, and I got haptics on the touch pads and a chime when I press the power button, but it doesn't finish turning on. \n\nOne thing, when I first turned it on after swapping the battery, it actually got to the main screen! I was so happy, but the interface was so slow and 5 minutes later it shut down and returned to no image/haptics and fans on. \n\nSo, does anyone know what could I do?, I live in MX so there is no option for an RMA, and so far I have tried:\n\nBattery storage mode. \n\nManual Battery storage mode (Vol up + three dots + power) \n\nAccessing Bios (because of no image, this doesn't work) \n\nDraining battery to 0 and then charging with official charger (nothing, but now with new battery maybe something might change?\n\nThe only thing that worked was physically disconnecting the battery l, but I'm a bit hesitant to open the deck so soon after just doing so. \n\nAnyone can help?

It won’t open.\n* Nexus and GameBanana installers mention needing the loader and Reloaded but give Windows instructions only.\n\n**Where I’m stuck:**\n\n* How to properly run Reloaded in my SD\n* How to use DSTS mod loader with Reloaded\n* How and where to place mod files so the game launches with mods on Deck.\n\nSo yeah, if anyone knows about / can provide a step-by-step checklist that I can run on the Deck (exact protontricks commands, where to drop files in the prefix, how to set Steam launch options, how to confirm Reloaded is loaded) with screenshots or exact file paths, I would greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hi, deckers!\n\nI've had my deck for a year now, and I've enjoyed desktop mode a lot. It's nice and smooth and such a great user interface.  \nI've used all kinds of Windows and MacOS (former OSX) systems. But apart from some early Ubuntu 20 years ago (or more, maybe), I never experienced much of Linux and my memory of it was not the best.\n\nNow, it's such an awesome OS!\n\nI just bought a refurbished 27 inch, 1440p, 144 Hz, AOC gaming display in a really good sale. Added a Ugreen dock and USB-C switch (like the old-days KVM interfaces) for my mouse and keyboard (to be shared between my 8 year old Windows laptop and the new Steam Deck \"desktop\".\n\nI set the external display as primary and set it to 1440p 144 Hz. Super crisp and fluid. But.... it has some stuttering and hiccups. I eventually reduced it to 120 Hz and it seemed more stable.\n\nFor those of you that use the Deck in a dock, as a desktop, what was the sweet spot for you in terms of resolution and refresh rate, for it to behave nicely?\n\nEDIT: not going to try and play at 1440p, guys, just to use it as desktop for browsing, office work, etc.",

I sent it in for repair, and when I got it back, the screen had indeed been swapped. However, they also sent it back with someone else's case on it, and a scuffed shoulder button (I presume it occurred while applying the case).\n\nI sent it back to them once more, requesting the case be removed and the shoulder button replaced. I've just received it back, and they did both things. Heck, they even included a brand new charger in the box. Not bad! \n\nExcept, after holding the Deck for a couple minutes, I noticed a distinct lack of orange.\n\nThe thumbsticks. They had been swapped for standard OLED thumbsticks.\n\nI have no clue WHY this is. There were no issues with my thumbsticks before. We never discussed swapping them. And they swapped them for the normal version on a limited edition console.\n\nAbsolutely insane. I've never had this much issue with a repair service before. I will now be sending my unit in for a THIRD TIME because they keep sending it back to me with new damage.\n\nThird picture is for reference from the Valve video for what they're supposed to look like.\n\nAnd before people ask again: yes, this Deck has the same S/N as the one I sent in the last two times.",

I wanted to say thank you to everyone who congratulated me in my previous post, it was very nice. \n\nTo be clear, this game is free, it has no additional costs, no paid DLC, no commercials, nothing. I simply wanted to make this game and now I hope people are willing to play it because there went a lot of work into making it. I rather see 100 players instead of 10 paid players. \n\nI started making this back in 2012, so basically it was more than 10 years in development. But I made it while I was studying and working.

The interface scales well to the smaller screen, with crisp text and intuitive navigation that never feels cramped, and with equally impressive performance being rock-solid so far, locked to an immaculate 60fps, with quick load times, it feels right at home. Battery usage has been light, too, ranging between 7W - 10W, which makes it ideal for longer, more involved play sessions away from the ever-reliable charger.\n\nNo notes, this is a fantastic game to play on the Steam Deck.\"",

    "selftext": "Kind of a noob question, but I'm curious of the quality of Remote Play over a local network as well as with resolution output.  \n\nFor context, I used to have my PC and TV in the same room and used my 4k tv as a second monitor which I would play games on via Big Picture Mode.  I recently moved and now my TV is in the living room and PC is in the office.  I kind of got used to playing my PC on my couch and find it hard to go back to the computer desk for a lot of games.\n\nI was thinking of moving my PC to my living room but then I would lose the desktop setup for other games (FPS etc)  I saw that the Steam Deck has a dock which connects to HDMI which might be the solution I'm looking for.  While I like the portability of the Deck, I'm wondering if I can just use it as an access point to my PC and connect it to the TV while using controller or mouse and keyboard to game from my living room (basically using it as a replacement for Big Picture Mode). \n\nWould the Steam Deck be worth the price if I mainly use it docked to stream my PC to my TV?  I'm afraid of the latency while playing over a wifi network as well as upscaling the resolution to 1440 or 4k.  I feel like this would be a considerable downgrade from using the TV as a monitor but maybe I'm wrong?  Does anyone else use their Deck this way?\n\nThanks!",

The audio will be in sync for all the displays (tried 5 so far.) \n\nFirst install Decky on your Steam Deck. \nThe link is below. \n\nhttps://decky.xyz/\n\nThen install the Sunshine Plugin. \nYou'll have to go into desktop mode to install Sunshine first before being able to use the Decky Plugin. \n\nWith that done. Setup Artemis (Moonlight port) test the connection to make sure that it works. \n\nThen on the other screens make sure you can run Artemis on it (Android set top box or projector will be fine) Doesn't have to be powerful. \n\n\nI've tried it on a Pi but it lagged too much. 😭\n\nRun Artemis put in your Steam Decks IP and it  should appear. \n\nOnce that is running. Connect your Sonos up via Bluetooth. Then change the audio output to your speaker. Its automatically set to Sync Sunshine. \n\nThen go into the settings of the SONOS app, select all the speakers and it should play through all the speakers. ",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

    "title": "Looking for a simple, low-maintenance camera setup for my parents’ house",
    "selftext": "My parents have a lovely little property with a garden and a few acres of land. It’s their pride and joy... they take care of it all themselves, from flower beds to chickens.\n\nBut lately I’ve noticed it’s becoming harder for them to keep track of everything.... Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar? Any recommendations for brands or setups that don’t need heavy installation or complicated apps?",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "[](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZigBee/?f=flair_name%3A%22help%20request%22)Hi everyone! This is a follow up post to one I made a few days ago. I'm trying to come up with a way to use a bluetooth (not wifi) thermometer/hygrometer and connect it to a pc (windows). I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar?

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a project where I need to take gas pressure readings from four different locations and record them at intervals of 2-5 seconds.\n\nI initially looked for gas pressure transmitters and data loggers that can handle 4-20 mA signals, but I couldn't find a suitable one locally. Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

They are warm white with color temperature of 4700 Kelvins but I find them too bright for garden mood lighting. I read online that I need to consider the total wattage that the dimmer will support (e.g. if  I have two strings connected together I would need a dimmer that can support: 60 bulbs x 7 watts each bulb= total 420 watts) and that it's compatible with the listed 31 voltage, right? Could you point me to a dimmer available in Europe (the Netherlands) hopefully?",

We have Simplisafe for security (door sensors, window sensors, glass break sensors, and a smart lock). Wondering if it would make more sense to leave Google and go all Simplisafe? \n\nAlso open to an altogether different alternative if there is a competitor that can offer security and automation in one.

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Help identifying Danfoss radiator valve types + correct adapters for tado X (Denmark, district heating)",
    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a project where I need to take gas pressure readings from four different locations and record them at intervals of 2-5 seconds.\n\nI initially looked for gas pressure transmitters and data loggers that can handle 4-20 mA signals, but I couldn't find a suitable one locally. Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

They are IP65 bulbs for outdoor use but the dimmer will be indoor. These light bulbs are not listed as dimmable but other buyers noted they bought a separate dimmer to go with them. They are warm white with color temperature of 4700 Kelvins but I find them too bright for garden mood lighting. I read online that I need to consider the total wattage that the dimmer will support (e.g. if  I have two strings connected together I would need a dimmer that can support: 60 bulbs x 7 watts each bulb= total 420 watts) and that it's compatible with the listed 31 voltage, right? Could you point me to a dimmer available in Europe (the Netherlands) hopefully?",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI have a garage door that can be opened using either a remote or a PIN code. Unfortunately, my kids often forget their PIN or lose their remote. I’d like to replace the system with a fingerprint reader instead. I know it’s not the most secure option, but honestly, having a remote lying around in the driveway isn’t great either.\n\nI’m looking for a simple, weather-resistant (lots of rain) fingerprint reader that can be managed directly on the device, via a web interface, or through an app. Ideally, it should also integrate with Home Assistant.\n\nThere are a lot of Chinese models on the market, but it’s hard to tell which ones are reliable. I’ve looked into Anviz. The P7 is still available locally but seems to be EOL, and the C2 Slim appears to be out of stock everywhere.\n\nDoes anyone have other suggestions or recommendations for specific models?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

    "selftext": "Hello there. I have had success using the Lutron Caseta switches with the hub plugged into my router. I have been using water sensors with Samsung Smart Things but, even with the zigbee protocol the devices go offline frequently and don’t create the mesh I was looking to create. \n\nSo I found the YoLink starter kit on Amazon. Has anyone had any experiences with these sensors and hub ? They are using LoRa to provide connectivity. And use AAA batteries not the lithium ones the Samsung sensors require. \n\nI also am using Google home and have downloaded the app. And it is integrated. I just need to buy the devices. Any reviews from anyone using these in their home ? \n\nLink provided in case you’re are curious. Amazon has this kit for $10.00 less than the manufacturer \n\nThis YoLink starter kit includes a hub and 4 water leak sensors that provide SMS, email, and push notifications to help prevent water damage. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/ehedlNH\n\n",

Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

There is occasional mail theft in my area, so it's helpful to know when mail is here so I can get it right away.\n\nI can't use a standard contact sensor because it's not a normal tube-style US mailbox. It is an enclosed box with a flap on the front top half and a locking door on the front bottom half. It's basically like this one: [https://gainesmfg.com/products/classic-pedestal-mailbox](https://gainesmfg.com/products/classic-pedestal-mailbox)\n\nMy solution was to use a wired contact sensor inside to trigger on the flap opening, with the wires snaking out the bottom and a smart sensor that supports dry contacts (external sensor) mounted underneath so the signal will work.\n\nI had previously used an Ecolink Door/Window sensor, and then the Aeotec Door/Window Sensor 7 Pro when the Ecolink failed. Unfortunately, after a few years, the Aeotec has now died and it's discontinued.\n\nSo, does anyone know a good smart sensor with the following features?\n\n* Battery powered\n* Z-Wave or Zigbee (no WiFi or BT)\n* Supports connecting an external sensor\n* Preferably resistant to the weather\n* US $50 or less if possible\n* No more than about 1/2in (1.3cm) on one dimension so I can mount it\n\nI'm located in the US, so I'd like to use a US-based seller so I don't need to navigate the whole import mess currently going on.",

I saw that the company shut down or something like that. I have zero interest in any complicated set ups to make it work again so I'm looking to replace them. What are some good budget replacements? Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. ㅤNeed 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS.

    "title": "Trouble wiring Smart boiler - ZBMINIR2 (UK)",
    "selftext": "I've wired the ZBMINIR2's in to other boilers previously, just replacing the default relay with the ZBMINI. My current boiler is wired up differently however.\n\nThe first picture is the default setup. The white wire in the trunking is Live In. The white on the left goes in to the relay (to trigger the central heating), and the white on the right goes from the relay to the boiler. The Black is permanent live to the boiler for hot water.\n\nThe second picture is using WAGO connecters instead of the standard connector, hot water works fine.\n\nThe third picture shows how the relay is wired (there's a piece that plugs in to connect and control). My assumption was that I could just swap that Live/Neutral on the left to the inputs on the ZBMINIR2, and then the Live/Neutral on the right to the outputs, and everything should work.\n\nWith just the inputs, the ZBMINIR2 'works' fine, in that I can see it and toggle it in HomeAssistant. However the issue is that whenever I power the boiler on with the outputs connected, my RCD trips instantly.\n\n  \nHoping for some advice on what I'm doing wrong, because I am perplexed.",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I currently have it on a smart outlet thats on/off on a schedule. I would like to find a smart outlet that will dim on/off the lights over the course of anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. I dont really care what the time increment is. I just wanna be able to set it to dim on at x time and dim off at x time. I have cruised youtube and the google and have not found what I'm lookin for yet, i dont think. So i figured id come to the ole reddit and see if what I'm looking for even exists and if anyone has specific products they would suggest. ",

Any suggestions?\n\nI’ve read quite a few reviews saying Aqara can be hit-or-miss in smart setups (lag, stability, hub quirks). I’m open to solid alternatives available in Europe (EU versions). Please share your picks.  \n  \nLooking for a reliable setup with low latency and stable performance over time.\n\nThanks!",

I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

    "selftext": "We recently moved into a new place that has a number of large accordion blinds around the house. We would absolutely love to get these set up into our smart home system (Alexa currently, Home Assistant likely in the future) so that they can go up and down on a timer throughout the day. I've been trying to find a motorized retrofit system for them but haven't had any luck. I've found sets that will tilt horizontal blinds (these blinds don't have the twist rod), and others that will open curtains by running a motor across the top pole, but I can't seem to find any that are set up to pull the cords to open a standard set of blinds. If anybody happens to know if these exist and could let me know I would really appreciate it!",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I dont really care what the time increment is. I just wanna be able to set it to dim on at x time and dim off at x time. I have cruised youtube and the google and have not found what I'm lookin for yet, i dont think. So i figured id come to the ole reddit and see if what I'm looking for even exists and if anyone has specific products they would suggest. ",

Any suggestions?\n\nI’ve read quite a few reviews saying Aqara can be hit-or-miss in smart setups (lag, stability, hub quirks). I’m open to solid alternatives available in Europe (EU versions). Please share your picks.  \n  \nLooking for a reliable setup with low latency and stable performance over time.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have a large system that is a collection random smarthome products. I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

So now I really need to try and get the data off of this\n\nI found conflicting info on if turning it on again after fully turning it off and disconnecting the power would help. I found one post from someone in a similar situation saying that let the PC detect the drive and boot, and they were then able to fix the issue from there, but another site said doing that could damage the drive further and lead to more data being lost (also saw recommendations to try clearing the CMOS but that also requires turning it on)\n\nSimilarly saw some people saying using an enclosure and trying to read it from another PC would be fine, and others saying it was risky and could even cause issues with the other system\n\nThere's also an additional issue on top of all this because the PC is built by PC Specialist and still within the three year warranty, and I was hoping I can get the data out in a way where I can then get them to fix it? (IDK how much that matters or what they can do in this situation though)\n\nBasically, would the least risky option be a) try turning the PC on again, b) take the M.2 drive out and try to read it using an enclosure on another computer, c) boot from installation media and use sfc /scannow, d) get outside tech help or e) something else I haven't thought of? And would any of this void the PC Specialist warranty?\n\nSystem specs:\nWindows 11 Home 64 bit\ni9-12900KS\nAsus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero\nCorsair Vengeance DDR5 2X16GB\nRTX 4080\n2TB Samsung 990 Pro M.2 NVMe",

It was most likely the CPU (task manager said it was used 100%). Now I got the same issue, but disk being at 100%. I did a benchmark, and this is the result.

He said he doesn't have ultrasonic equipment and even if he temporarily fixed it, the damage would probably come back.

After the upgrade, the system displays the following error on startup:\n\n“A disk read error occurred. Press Ctrl + Alt + Del to restart.”\n\nSystem Details: • Model: Dell OptiPlex 9020 • Storage Configuration: RAID 0 (two Kingston SUV400S 120GB SSDs) • Intel Rapid Storage Technology (Option ROM): v12.7.0.1936 • RAID Volume Status: Normal (confirmed in Ctrl + I menu)\n\nTroubleshooting Steps Tried (unsuccessful): 1. Checked BIOS settings – RAID mode confirmed as “On” and boot order correct. 2. Verified RAID array – Status is “Normal,” no degraded disks. 3. Booted from Windows 11 installation media and attempted: • Automatic Startup Repair • Command prompt boot recovery commands (bootrec /fixmbr, /fixboot, /scanos, /rebuildbcd) • chkdsk on the main RAID volume 4. Loaded Intel RST drivers (versions 14.8.16.1063 and 15.2) during repair – RAID volume recognized, but the system still fails to boot. 5. Checked both UEFI and Legacy BIOS modes – same error persists. 6. Attempted rebuilding EFI and BCD manually – no success.\n\nDespite these efforts, the machine continues to show the same “disk read error” immediately after POST.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance. Please let me know if you need any diagnostic logs or screenshots.\n\nRegards, Amer",

A few years ago, when I got the GPU, I ran some benchmarks, and my score was about average for my components. Recently, I cleaned out my water cooling loop and dusted off the fans as I noticed the CPU temp getting a little too high during gaming sessions. I wanted to double-check the performance of my GPU and CPU to see if it was back to its original state. To my surprise, my scores dropped quite a bit, and I cannot seem to figure out the cause. It looks like my CPU is down in score as well!\n\nI have checked forums and trobuleshooted for days, but nothing seems to work. I have done the following so far.\n\n1. Cleaned and drained loop (Temperatures seem fine and even better during testing)\n2. Updated Motherboard BIOS\n3. Made sure to select \"Gaming BIOS\" on the GPU\n4. MSI CPU Gaming Boost turned on in BIOS\n5. Resizable Bar turned on\n6. Viturzialtion off and not installed\n7. Single Monitor\n8. 2 sticks of RAM vs 4 sticks (no difference)\n9. Overclocking (you can see the lower recent score has a higher clock speed for both CPU and GPU)\n10. G-Sync off\n11. Afterburner and Rivatuner off\n12. Memory passed Memtest86+\n13.

I have a Gigabyte B560 Motherboard, with an I5-11400f and a 3060 TI. I had to turn XMP, Secure Boot, and TMP back on since it reset everything. It worked for two games, and I had to go back messing with settings and such. I decided to turn off my XMP profile to see if that would help, as it had also worked for other people. Well, when I disabled it, I got a message saying that Windows did not boot. So I turned XMP back on, and it has been working fine. I looked through my Event Viewer and found a new error stating \"Fatal Hardware error\". It appears every time I boot the system. So I am wondering if it is a false positive, or if either the RAM or the CPU is causing the issue. The PC has been slow to boot since updating the BIOS, but I don't know what else to do. Do I leave it as is since it is running fine, or do I keep messing with it? I have additional RAM sticks to try, and I also heard clearing CMOS could be a fix, but I figured to ask here before I do anything. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.",

    "selftext": "Hey all. I was hoping someone could help point me in the right direction as to how to diagnose connectivity issues when gaming on my PC.\n\nLiterally every game that I play online and have to choose a server, it shows the signal strength, it's ALWAYS either yellow (moderate) or red (poor). Never green (good). I never run below 90-100ms in-game. I thought it might be my old router/modem, so I purchased a new one. That helped a lot with downloads (granted, i still think they should be faster), etc. But still the same issue in games. Even when a game server is located less than an hour from my house in VA, still the same issue. \n\n\n\nMy speedtest results seem good.\n\n  Download Mbps\n\n1013.23\n\n Upload Mbps\n\n15.75\n\nPing ms  25\n\n\n\nPC and modem/router are all up to date. I'm running windows 11. Xfinity internet. Nighthawk CAX80. \n\n Just not sure how to go about fixing this.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

    "selftext": "\nSo here is what happened: I recieved an e-commerce newsletter from a furniture website. Annoyed, because I believed I had already unsubscribed a while ago, I quickly scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the unsubscribe button. It took me to a website with just a white background with the text “successfully unsubscribed” and some other smaller info. I then went back to the email to delete it when I noticed the e-mail address. Instead of being the official website URL (for example: furnituredepot@furnituredepot.com) there was an extra letter: furnituredepot@e.furnituredepot.com.  This immediately set off alarms for me. I downloaded AVAST in a hurry to detect and delete any malware. It found nothing. Then I deleted Avast and downloaded bitdefender premium because I read that it was better than the former. I have ran two Bitdefender tests and they both came back with nothing. I also logged out of that email and changed the password to the email on a separate device (although I wonder if this is futile because what if the attacker connected to my wifi network??)\n\nMy question is: I didn’t fill in any information nor did anything visibly download on my computer BUT I am scared that maybe I accidentally downloaded a keylogger on my computer. I have heard that sometimes keyloggers go undetected by malware software. So is my only option to just factory reset my entire laptop? Can bitdefender detect all types of keyloggers? If not bitdefender does anyone else have an idea of what can? I would hope because I would lose files and need to redownload apps, etc. \n\nI also contacted the privacy email of the company to ask if that URL address is theirs. They confirmed with me today that is not their email. I was hoping I was just overreacting because the newsletter looked so real (I know this is so eye-roll worthy to say but it really did, like I hovered over images and they purported to link to the official website).

Could this still be a **CPU issue** even though it posts and shows temps fine?\n2. Should I re-seat the 5950X or re-apply thermal paste before updating BIOS?\n3. Would a faulty RTX 3080 still pass POST but crash under driver load?\n4. Any other stability or power settings I should tweak before flashing 7C91vAK1?\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nReplaced nearly everything except CPU & GPU. MemTest clean. BIOS old (E7C91AMS.290). Freezes continue during Windows install or repair screens. Trying to determine if CPU or GPU is to blame before reflashing BIOS.\n\nAny advice or similar experiences appreciated 🙏\n\nEdit:  \nUSB is currently 2.0 32gb, tried a USB 3.2 256gb and had the same issue, tried 6 fresh windows installer to check if its corrupted and didn't change the issue.",

The thing that lately is odd for me is that, when i go to facebook, a few hours later i have the email with the code, today i entered creditkarma (that i rarely go in my computer) and i received an sms for code log-in (that i didnt request).\n\nHave in mind that i replaced my laptop shortly after the first incident, and any files transfered where via google drive, and they were scanned.

It may seem stupid, but I want it done this way so that I can basically only have access to things I need while I’m working from home. It may seem unnecessary but I know myself too well. I’ve only got access to my personal computer so everything I’d use in my down time is literally 2 clicks away and I am notorious for getting distracted. Plan is to basically lock it all down, chuck the usb somewhere I know where it is but can’t easily access it while I’m on the clock, and then when I clock off I can grab it and do whatever I want. I want a physical object for this because it’s too easy for me to set a parental lock, but then just enter in the admin password and disable it. Is it possible to do this, or am I off on a wild goose chase?",

Ever since the update my PC will now randomly shut off (black screen, not blue) with an error message but it happens too quickly for me to see what it says. In windows event Viewer it always shows the source as Kernel Power. I cannot figure out what is wrong. This only started happening after the windows 11 update two weeks ago. There doesnt seem to be a specific reason the crash happens. For instance I use my PC for a lot of video editing and I constantly get this error when importing clips to premier pro from my external SSD which causes it to crash, the PC also tends to crash when Im not really doing anything on it like If im sitting on my phone not using the PC with google pulled up it will crash. Conversely some heavily demanding applications dont cause any crashing, I will play the new battlefield on high graphical settings with a discord call pulled up and it has never had a problem but I tried to upload a YT short this morning and it caused a crash.\n\nA couple of things Ive already done/ tried:\n\n\\- Updated all drivers\n\n\\- Updated Bios\n\n\\- Ensured PSU cables are securely connected\n\n\\- Reinstalled Windows 11\n\n\\- Deleted media cache, reset preferences, and reinstalled premier pro\n\n\\- Trouble shoot windows update: no problems found\n\n\\- SFC Scan: completed multiple times (no problems)\n\n\\- DISM Scan: completed multiple times (no problems)\n\n\\- Removed peripherals and it still crashed\n\n\\- Malware and security scans: no problems\n\n\\- Over 500 GB of disk storage available so its not a memory issue\n\nAt this point im out of ideas and wondering if anyone had a similar issue or knows what to do short of a full system reset. Im thinking of just buying a new PC at this point because the system is about 5 years old anyways and I was thinking about upgrading. This is insane to me that I never had this issue once and now its a non stop problem with Win 11.\n\nPC Specs:\n\nGPU: Nvidia RTX 3060Ti\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X\n\nMobo: Gigabyte B550 UD AC VER: 1.0\n\nRam: T-force 32 GB DDR4\n\nI appreciate anything you can do to help!",

After this, my system no longer boots into Windows, though other Linux installations still work perfectly.\n4.

My cursor still moves around and app icons get highlighted, but I just can't click anything, so I have no way to open Task Manager or even shut down my computer normally, so I have to force it to shut down every time. It used to only happen once or twice every couple days, but yesterday it happened five times in one day so I feel like my computer is on borrowed time lol.\n\nSomething strange I've noticed recently is that even when browsers and apps work, the Windows taskbar and anything related to Windows menus won't. This is less disruptive but will eventually require me to force shut down my computer eventually anyway because I just can't... open the menu to turn it off normally, and if I try to interact with the taskbar too much the freezing might spread. It also does a weird thing sometimes where the whole bar or menu is this blurred gray colour, but I assume that's because of whatever extreme lag is happening?\n\n  \nI've tried running a memory test (which didn't reveal any errors or problems), and Task Manager says everything looks fine when the problem *isn't* occurring, but I can't look at it when the problem does occur. I did the sfc /scannow thing yesterday and a bunch of drivers got repaired so I thought that would fix the problem, but it didn't. At this point the freezing has happened while I'm in a game, but most of the time it happens when I just have my browser and Discord open. \n\nI tried booting up my computer in safe mode, but my keyboard and mouse wouldn't register in any USB port so I had to give up on that too.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? FYI I'm on Windows 11, 24H2. As a last ditch effort I'll probably try installing the 25H2 update to see if that fixes it, but from what I've heard it's a really light patch so it probably isn't that?

    "title": "Trying to fresh install windows - getting hung up. Please help!",
    "selftext": "I'm at my whits end with this and can't figure it out. Built a PC a few years ago that has served me well since. Asus B550-F motherboard, Ryzen 5700G CPU, 32GB Corsair DDR4, Asus Strix 1070 GPU, and a Crucial M.2. It's mainly used for photo editing and organization. Originally built with Windows 10 and then upgraded to Windows 11 about a year or so ago with no issue.\n\nFew days ago, I started noticing some errors when booting about DLL's not found, so I decided to take the opportunity to upgrade my M.2 drive and start fresh. I picked up a Samsung 2TB 990 Pro, backed up everything I needed, and swapped in the new drive to get the process started.\n\nUsed my son's PC to create a Windows 11 installation media on a USB drive, then booted into BIOS and made sure the USB was set #1 in the boot order, then saved/restarted and got into the USB installation screen.\n\nFirst attempt, it froze when I was halfway through putting in my product key on the third screen. I thought it weird, but just figured a glitch, so I restarted the process again. Second time, I get to where it starts installing and then the screen froze at 7%. I let it sit there for about 15 minutes before shutting down.\n\nAt this point, I decided to remove all non-essential hardware, which was the GPU and a USB controller. Also disconnected the ethernet. Only thing remaining plugged into the board was the memory and CPU, and I had one monitor connected to the onboard port. And of course a mouse and keyboard.\n\nRestarted again and this time the installation got up to 15%, then it just went to a black screen and rebooted automatically. When it came back up, it attempted to boot from the M.2 but of course gave an error message and options for startup repair, shutdown, and UEFI bios. Only option that worked was UEFI. So I went back in and changed the Boot order to USB at top again. I then reset the bios settings to default.\n\nTried booting one more time and it froze up on the product key screen before I even started typing.\n\nNext I tried swapping memory with my son's PC that is identical to mine, built around the same time with nearly the exact same specs. That didn't work either. Multiple automatic restarts and freezes at various points.\n\nI've also tried using three different USB thumb drives, each time ensuring they are formatted FAT32. I've tried both the Windows 10 and Windows 11 installation media creation, and see the same issues with both. I've tried creating the media on three different Windows 11 computers we have in the house.\n\nI'm only using USB ports on the back and have tried all the different configurations for mouse/keyboard/usb drive in the various ports.\n\nAs a last ditch effort, I flashed the BIOS to the latest stable version from Asus, since the one on the board was from 2021. The flash went fine, but did not help this issue at all. Still seeing the same thing this morning after I turned it off and unplugged everything to let it set last night.\n\nSometimes, when it boots into the Windows USB screen, it pops up a message saying \"It looks like you started an upgrade and booted from installation media. If you want to continue the upgrade, remove the media from your PC and click Yes. If you want to perform a clean installation instead, click No.\" I've tried doing both with no change in result. Clicking yes takes you to a blue screen error message to repair the disk. Clicking no takes me back to the setup screen to start over and freeze/restart again.\n\nAlso, when I go into the BIOS, I never have an issue with it freezing or spontaneously rebooting. I've left it sitting in the bios for 20+ minutes and came back to still be able to cycle through the menus and make changes. It's only once it gets to the Windows setup screens that behavior starts presenting.\n\nIs there anything else I'm missing that I can try? Is something wrong with my motherboard and I just need to replace it?\n\nPlease help! I thought this was going to be just a simple down and up refresh and take me half a day to reinstall all my apps and settings. I'm going on day 3 of fighting with this project now.\n\nAfter googling for a while, I've come across some other reddit discussions from a while back with very similar experiences.  Some were solved with replacing the CPU, some with replacing the power supply.  At this point, the only things I haven't ruled out are the CPU, motherboard, and power supply.  So, I may try replacing the CPU, but hoping there might be something else I can try first before going full parts cannon on it.\n\nThanks",

For example, I have a folder in my Downloads that's full of videos. I right click -> Properties -> \n\nCustomize -> Optimize this folder for: Videos. I click \"Also apply this template to all subfolders\". I click \"Apply\" and then \"OK\" to exit. Once I've done all that, I click on the folder... and it still appears as a list view.

However, just last night I was gaming on it and the monitor all of a sudden turned off but would still play sounds and such. I unplugged it and turned it back on, and the blue indicator light started blinking and the screen began to flicker on and off without truly turning on. Since then, I haven't been able to turn it off, and the only way to get it to turn off is by unplugging the power cord. Is there any way to fix this problem?",

They discovered that my phone number is listed as a verified phone number on their Google account.\nI have 1000% no idea how it got there. I never accessed their account, I don't know their password, I would never, ever do that.\nNow, they are accusing me of hacking them and trying to steal their account. They are not listening to any of my explanations and are treating me like a criminal. I've tried to explain that for my number to be added, someone would have needed a 6-digit verification code that Google would have sent to my phone. I never received a code like that, and I definitely never gave one to anyone.\nThey are not accepting this fact and are convinced I'm lying.\nI'm at a total loss. I'm being accused of something I didn't do.\nI have two main questions:\n * How is this technically possible? Could their account have been hacked by a real hacker who, for some bizarre reason, used my phone number? How would that hacker have gotten the verification code from my phone?\n * How can I prove my innocence? I've asked my friend to check their account's security activity (like the \"Details\" link at the bottom of Gmail) which should show the IP address and device that made the change. They are either too freaked out to do it or don't believe me. Is there any way for me to prove it wasn't me?\nWhat do I do now?\nTL;DR: My phone number is on my friend's Google account. I didn't put it there. They are accusing me of hacking them and won't listen to reason. How can I prove I'm innocent?",

So now I really need to try and get the data off of this\n\nI found conflicting info on if turning it on again after fully turning it off and disconnecting the power would help. I found one post from someone in a similar situation saying that let the PC detect the drive and boot, and they were then able to fix the issue from there, but another site said doing that could damage the drive further and lead to more data being lost (also saw recommendations to try clearing the CMOS but that also requires turning it on)\n\nSimilarly saw some people saying using an enclosure and trying to read it from another PC would be fine, and others saying it was risky and could even cause issues with the other system\n\nThere's also an additional issue on top of all this because the PC is built by PC Specialist and still within the three year warranty, and I was hoping I can get the data out in a way where I can then get them to fix it? (IDK how much that matters or what they can do in this situation though)\n\nBasically, would the least risky option be a) try turning the PC on again, b) take the M.2 drive out and try to read it using an enclosure on another computer, c) boot from installation media and use sfc /scannow, d) get outside tech help or e) something else I haven't thought of?

    "selftext": "Ciao ragazzi,\n\n**The situation:** My HP OMEN 16 got liquid damaged. It's only about a year and half old and was basically like new before this. Warranty just expired (perfect timing, right? 😭).\n\nTook it to a tech in Italy who cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol. He said he doesn't have ultrasonic equipment and even if he temporarily fixed it, the damage would probably come back. Recommended selling for parts.\n\n**I'm a student and this was my main laptop** for everything. Now I need to sell it fast to help buy a replacement for school.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* HP OMEN 16 (bought \\~2024, about 1.5 year old)\n* RTX 4060 8GB\n* i7 (13620H)\n* 16\" display \\*165 hz, 1980x1080\n* 2x16GB DDR5 ram, 5200Mhz\n\n**What definitely works:**\n\n* Display (perfect, like new) 165hz\n* Battery (low cycles, good health)\n* Keyboard (excellent condition)\n* Charger + original bag like new\n\n**What's dead:**\n\n* Motherboard (won't boot)\n* One RAM slot\n* One fan\n* 1-RAM stick\n* Warranty (expired)\n\n**What's unknown:**\n\n* RTX 4060 (looks clean after cleaning, untested)\n* i7 CPU (same - looks okay, can't test)\n* anything else\n\n**I'm thinking €250** for everything (laptop, charger, bag). Is that fair for a laptop with these specs and issues? on ebay or something similar\n\nI really need to replace this for university. Any advice appreciated 🙏\n\n\\[Photos: before/after cleaning, board, complete package\\]\n\nLocation: Italy",

After the upgrade, the system displays the following error on startup:\n\n“A disk read error occurred. Press Ctrl + Alt + Del to restart.”\n\nSystem Details: • Model: Dell OptiPlex 9020 • Storage Configuration: RAID 0 (two Kingston SUV400S 120GB SSDs) • Intel Rapid Storage Technology (Option ROM): v12.7.0.1936 • RAID Volume Status: Normal (confirmed in Ctrl + I menu)\n\nTroubleshooting Steps Tried (unsuccessful): 1. Checked BIOS settings – RAID mode confirmed as “On” and boot order correct. 2. Verified RAID array – Status is “Normal,” no degraded disks. 3. Booted from Windows 11 installation media and attempted: • Automatic Startup Repair • Command prompt boot recovery commands (bootrec /fixmbr, /fixboot, /scanos, /rebuildbcd) • chkdsk on the main RAID volume 4. Loaded Intel RST drivers (versions 14.8.16.1063 and 15.2) during repair – RAID volume recognized, but the system still fails to boot. 5. Checked both UEFI and Legacy BIOS modes – same error persists. 6. Attempted rebuilding EFI and BCD manually – no success.\n\nDespite these efforts, the machine continues to show the same “disk read error” immediately after POST.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance. Please let me know if you need any diagnostic logs or screenshots.\n\nRegards, Amer",

A few years ago, when I got the GPU, I ran some benchmarks, and my score was about average for my components. Recently, I cleaned out my water cooling loop and dusted off the fans as I noticed the CPU temp getting a little too high during gaming sessions. I wanted to double-check the performance of my GPU and CPU to see if it was back to its original state. To my surprise, my scores dropped quite a bit, and I cannot seem to figure out the cause. It looks like my CPU is down in score as well!\n\nI have checked forums and trobuleshooted for days, but nothing seems to work. I have done the following so far.\n\n1. Cleaned and drained loop (Temperatures seem fine and even better during testing)\n2. Updated Motherboard BIOS\n3. Made sure to select \"Gaming BIOS\" on the GPU\n4. MSI CPU Gaming Boost turned on in BIOS\n5. Resizable Bar turned on\n6. Viturzialtion off and not installed\n7. Single Monitor\n8. 2 sticks of RAM vs 4 sticks (no difference)\n9. Overclocking (you can see the lower recent score has a higher clock speed for both CPU and GPU)\n10. G-Sync off\n11. Afterburner and Rivatuner off\n12. Memory passed Memtest86+\n13. Positive reinforcement\n14. Purchased Etsy Witch Spell\n\nIf anyone can give me some more suggestions, I would really appreciate it!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LMQepO6",

I have a Gigabyte B560 Motherboard, with an I5-11400f and a 3060 TI. I had to turn XMP, Secure Boot, and TMP back on since it reset everything. It worked for two games, and I had to go back messing with settings and such. I decided to turn off my XMP profile to see if that would help, as it had also worked for other people. Well, when I disabled it, I got a message saying that Windows did not boot. So I turned XMP back on, and it has been working fine. I looked through my Event Viewer and found a new error stating \"Fatal Hardware error\". It appears every time I boot the system. So I am wondering if it is a false positive, or if either the RAM or the CPU is causing the issue. The PC has been slow to boot since updating the BIOS, but I don't know what else to do. Do I leave it as is since it is running fine, or do I keep messing with it? I have additional RAM sticks to try, and I also heard clearing CMOS could be a fix, but I figured to ask here before I do anything. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nThis is my **first time posting on Reddit**, so please be kind 😅. I’m **not a tech expert**, just someone trying to fix their laptop issue, so any help or simple explanations would be really appreciated.\n\nI recently upgraded my **ASUS TUF A16**  by adding new **RAM (2×16grayGB)** and a **new SSD**. Everything works perfectly during normal use, but there’s this strange issue whenever the laptop goes into **sleep mode**.\n\nWhen I open the lid or try to wake it up:\n\n* It sometimes **boots straight into BIOS**,\n* or it **restarts by itself**,\n* or the screen shows **grey/static noise**, and I have to **force shut down** by holding the power button.\n\nHere’s what I’ve already tried so far:\n\n* **Disabled Fast Boot** in BIOS and Windows\n* **Turned off the MUX switch** (just in case it was GPU-related)\n* **Created a new user profile** in Windows to test if it was a system-level issue\n* **Updated all drivers and BIOS**\n* Checked power and sleep settings multiple times\n\nEverything else works completely fine — performance is great, temps are normal, and both upgrades are detected properly.\n\nMy setup:\n\n* **Laptop:** ASUS TUF A16\n* **SSD:** WD\\_Black SN7100 NVMe 1TB (WDS100T4X0E-00CJA0) — PCIe Gen 4\n* **RAM:** Crucial 16GB DDR5 4800MHz CL40 (CT16G48C40S5 Black)\n\nThe only problem is when the laptop wakes from sleep — it either **boots straight into BIOS**, **restarts automatically**, or shows a **grey/static screen** until I force shut it down.\n\nHas anyone else faced this after upgrading RAM or SSD? Could it be a **compatibility issue**, **BIOS problem**, or something related to **sleep state settings**?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would really mean a lot 🙏",

    "selftext": "\nSo here is what happened: I recieved an e-commerce newsletter from a furniture website. Annoyed, because I believed I had already unsubscribed a while ago, I quickly scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the unsubscribe button. It took me to a website with just a white background with the text “successfully unsubscribed” and some other smaller info. I then went back to the email to delete it when I noticed the e-mail address. Instead of being the official website URL (for example: furnituredepot@furnituredepot.com) there was an extra letter: furnituredepot@e.furnituredepot.com.  This immediately set off alarms for me. I downloaded AVAST in a hurry to detect and delete any malware. It found nothing. Then I deleted Avast and downloaded bitdefender premium because I read that it was better than the former. I have ran two Bitdefender tests and they both came back with nothing. I also logged out of that email and changed the password to the email on a separate device (although I wonder if this is futile because what if the attacker connected to my wifi network??)\n\nMy question is: I didn’t fill in any information nor did anything visibly download on my computer BUT I am scared that maybe I accidentally downloaded a keylogger on my computer. I have heard that sometimes keyloggers go undetected by malware software. So is my only option to just factory reset my entire laptop? Can bitdefender detect all types of keyloggers? If not bitdefender does anyone else have an idea of what can? I would hope because I would lose files and need to redownload apps, etc. \n\nI also contacted the privacy email of the company to ask if that URL address is theirs. They confirmed with me today that is not their email. I was hoping I was just overreacting because the newsletter looked so real (I know this is so eye-roll worthy to say but it really did, like I hovered over images and they purported to link to the official website).

When I play games with my friends who have less powerful PCs, they always get much better performance than I do. I have run HWMonitor and PassMark Performance Test to try and figure out the issue and no such luck. I thought perhaps I was having a thermal issue but I re-seated and re-pasted my CPU and no performance improvement has occurred. I also tried reformatting my PC but the issue persists. I have the latest graphics driver installed and I keep my display at 1080p.\n\nMy PC Specs:  \nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ti  \nCPU - Intel Core i7 10700K  \nMotherboard - ASUS TUF Gaming Z490-Plus  \nRAM - Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x32 GB DDR4 3000  \nSSD - Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 2TB  \nPower Supply - Seasonic FOCUS Plus 850 Platinum\n\nThe PassMark Rating was as follows:  \nPASSMARK: 5711.3 (63rd Percentile)  \nCPU MARK: 14045.0 (53rd Percentile)  \n2D MARK: 188.4 (13th Percentile)  \n3D MARK: 9656.7 (53rd Percentile)  \nMEMORY MARK: 2444.0 (38th Percentile)  \nDISK MARK: 20275.5 (71st Percentile)\n\nWhile running the PassMark test my CPU max temperature was 83 celcius and my GPU max temperature was 60 celcius according to HWMonitor.  CPU Max Power was 196W, GPU Max Power was 342W, which I believe seems rather normal.\n\nAs a frame of reference, this weekend I played the Arc Raiders playtest with a friend of mine who has an RTX 3060 Ti and an Intel i7 8700K. Even though he clearly has a weaker GPU and CPU, he was averaging 70-75 fps while I was averaging 40-45 fps at the exact same graphics settings. Similar performance occurs in other games we play together as well. Often times, changing graphics quality settings has very little effect on FPS even when changing from the highest to lowest graphics presets, leading me to suspect it isn't a GPU issue.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! I'm completely dumbfounded and frustrated over this. Could it just be that I have a faulty CPU? Thanks!",

So now I really need to try and get the data off of this\n\nI found conflicting info on if turning it on again after fully turning it off and disconnecting the power would help. I found one post from someone in a similar situation saying that let the PC detect the drive and boot, and they were then able to fix the issue from there, but another site said doing that could damage the drive further and lead to more data being lost (also saw recommendations to try clearing the CMOS but that also requires turning it on)\n\nSimilarly saw some people saying using an enclosure and trying to read it from another PC would be fine, and others saying it was risky and could even cause issues with the other system\n\nThere's also an additional issue on top of all this because the PC is built by PC Specialist and still within the three year warranty, and I was hoping I can get the data out in a way where I can then get them to fix it? (IDK how much that matters or what they can do in this situation though)\n\nBasically, would the least risky option be a) try turning the PC on again, b) take the M.2 drive out and try to read it using an enclosure on another computer, c) boot from installation media and use sfc /scannow, d) get outside tech help or e) something else I haven't thought of?

Checked BIOS settings – RAID mode confirmed as “On” and boot order correct. 2. Verified RAID array – Status is “Normal,” no degraded disks. 3. Booted from Windows 11 installation media and attempted: • Automatic Startup Repair • Command prompt boot recovery commands (bootrec /fixmbr, /fixboot, /scanos, /rebuildbcd) • chkdsk on the main RAID volume 4. Loaded Intel RST drivers (versions 14.8.16.1063 and 15.2) during repair – RAID volume recognized, but the system still fails to boot. 5. Checked both UEFI and Legacy BIOS modes – same error persists. 6. Attempted rebuilding EFI and BCD manually – no success.\n\nDespite these efforts, the machine continues to show the same “disk read error” immediately after POST.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance. Please let me know if you need any diagnostic logs or screenshots.\n\nRegards, Amer",

I wanted to double-check the performance of my GPU and CPU to see if it was back to its original state. To my surprise, my scores dropped quite a bit, and I cannot seem to figure out the cause. It looks like my CPU is down in score as well!\n\nI have checked forums and trobuleshooted for days, but nothing seems to work. I have done the following so far.\n\n1. Cleaned and drained loop (Temperatures seem fine and even better during testing)\n2. Updated Motherboard BIOS\n3. Made sure to select \"Gaming BIOS\" on the GPU\n4. MSI CPU Gaming Boost turned on in BIOS\n5. Resizable Bar turned on\n6. Viturzialtion off and not installed\n7. Single Monitor\n8. 2 sticks of RAM vs 4 sticks (no difference)\n9. Overclocking (you can see the lower recent score has a higher clock speed for both CPU and GPU)\n10. G-Sync off\n11. Afterburner and Rivatuner off\n12. Memory passed Memtest86+\n13. Positive reinforcement\n14. Purchased Etsy Witch Spell\n\nIf anyone can give me some more suggestions, I would really appreciate it!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LMQepO6",

    "selftext": "Hello, \n\nLast year I was stupid and opened a file that compromised my passwords, It took a few months to recover/change all my passwords. but ever since sometimes i rarely receive an email like \"your password reset code is xxxx\" from facebook, or instagram, and similar that i didnt requested. but nothing else happens after, i assume that they try to enter by the code putting my email/phone. but they don't have access to my sms or email to use that code. i changed passwords and put two-factor where i could. The thing that lately is odd for me is that, when i go to facebook, a few hours later i have the email with the code, today i entered creditkarma (that i rarely go in my computer) and i received an sms for code log-in (that i didnt request).\n\nHave in mind that i replaced my laptop shortly after the first incident, and any files transfered where via google drive, and they were scanned. I feel I'm being watch. what could i do? ",
