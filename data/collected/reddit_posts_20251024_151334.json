I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

In the last month I upgraded to the iPhone 16 (running iOS 26.0.1) and I have had a lot of problems with the stereo screen jumping back and forth between Apple Carplay and Dual's local OS. My iPhone 16 does not completely disconnect because if I am playing music, it will continue playing even though Apple CarPlay is disconnected according to the screen. Even if I do not touch the option on my stereo screen for Apple CarPlay it will jump back and forth automatically between the Dual OS home page and Apple CarPlay.   \n\n\nIs this a glitch with iOS 26, or is my stereo system malfunctioning, maybe a hardware compatibility issue with the iPhone 16?",

It feels like my finger is being slightly pressed in all the time – almost like there’s a built-in Popsocket or something pushing against it.\n\nIt’s especially noticeable when I’m typing or trying to use it one-handed. My finger keeps bumping into that ridge, and it honestly feels uncomfortable after a while.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this or is it just me? Curious if this is a common thing or if I just need to adjust my grip or change cases.\n\nAnd if yes is the Pro Max different because I have \"longer\" fingers and the 16 Pro was okay but since the Camera Plateau it feels weird idk.\n\nBest Regards",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

Yes the transparency is still distracting in some places but I haven't found one that's particularly offensive yet. I like the new lockscreen, and to my surprise the animation actually felt more polished and responsive than iOS 18. I hope it really stay that way so I can extend my phone upgrade cycle to yet another year.",

Like looking up stuff on maps, navigating a little, finding places to visit, looking for tickets, tracking a hike, … I lived the power bank life with a 3rd party MagSafe power bank on a 13 mini, and it wasn’t as comfortable as they make it out to be. \n\nNow the apple official one is different, I get that. It‘s more slender, and it behaves completely differently. It’s not always charging or creating heat. It’s really more of an extender. It communicates smartly with the phone and can be charged as if it’s part of the main phone. Apple doesn’t do enough to explain that properly in my opinion. \n\nHow is the pocketable feel? Does it still go into pants front pockets easily?\n\nIt also feel a bit unusual to already get a power bank with a brand new phone. When a regular could probably just easily get me through the day.

So I thought I’d give my first-month impressions on it after returning the iPhone 17 Pro to buy it.\n\nThe battery life is great. Very similar to my 16 Pro when that was brand new. Zero complaints here. The fast wireless charging is also very fast. One of the biggest selling points of this phone for me was the screen size. It’s absolutely perfect at 6.5 inches - not too big, not too small.\n\nThe thinness of this phone coupled with the display size means I can comfortably use the phone one-handed. It’s still big enough to enjoy watching the odd sports game or TV show on it, too. I used to hate watching shows on my 16 Pro because the screen just felt too narrow.\n\nThe speaker sure took a day or two to get used to, but I’m absolutely fine with it now. No bottom speaker also means that I can lie the phone on my bed with the bottom flat against the bed without having a bunch of muffled sound, which is an unexpected but nice added benefit.\n\nThe single camera is great for me. I never used the ultra-wide, and I can't think of a time I needed to zoom in the last month, either.\n\nThis phone has made me excited to own an iPhone again. It’s been many, many years since I felt excited about using my phone daily! It’s a nice feeling. Sure, the Air isn’t for everybody. If you’re a content creator or amateur photographer, then do not buy this phone. But if you’re not, and value the bigger screen, the nice phone feeling, and you upgrade every couple of years, I think this phone is a no-brainer!",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using my iPhone 13 for the past few years, and last year I bought a Samsung S23 Ultra intending to switch but I just couldn’t get used to Android so I stuck with my iPhone.\n\nHowever, compared with my iPhone 13, I just fell in love with the S23 Ultra’s camera, especially the zoom quality. I mainly used it for concerts and events because of how good the zoom is, but it feels like such a waste to keep a whole phone just for that.\n\nI’m thinking of gifting the Samsung to my family and getting a new iPhone instead, but I don’t know much about camera specs or how they compare, especially when it comes to zoom and video.\n\nSo for anyone who knows more about iPhone cameras, which iPhone has video zoom quality that’s as good as the S23 Ultra (or better)? \n\nNot 100% necessary, but it would be great if it's an iPhone similar in size to iPhone 13 because another reason I couldn't get used to the Samsung phone was because of how big it is. \n\nAny insight into this would be much much appreciated thank you! 💗",

    "selftext": "Hi, \n\nI take photos with my iPhone (dah…) and I have both the Google Photos app (which uploads the pics to Google’s cloud) and Apple’s own Photos app. From time to time (eg. I’m just back from an overseas trip) I’d like to save the photos taken to my Win10 laptop into a folder, all pics, all metadata (most importantly timestamp) preserved. Nothing fully works… Downloading photos from Google’s cloud is a nightmare and often messes up metadata. Apple’s method (using the Apple Devices app on the laptop) simply doesn’t copy over all pics, it throws a not very helpful “unable to download xxx photos” message. Some of the photos downloaded (they’re jpgs!) don’t open. Anyway, I don’t rabbit on. Am I missing something? Is there a simple fail proof method? Perhaps an app on the iPhone? Anyone else experiences this mess? Note: this is my first iPhone, maybe 18 months old, before I only had Android phones and never ever had this mess.",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

If I want to download and log into Teams, access email in Outlook, or even access the company intranet in Safari, I need to install this device profile. \n\nAt my last workplace they didn’t have this requirement. I was able to install and sign into work apps like normal.\n\nI’m concerned about the fact that my work will be able to see all the apps I have installed on my phone and have the ability to factory reset my phone.\n\nMy work doesn’t provide company phones but for my job I’m required to be reachable after hours and will reimburse me for phone service after enrolling into BYOD. This makes me feel like after installing this profile, my work basically has custody over my phone??\n\nAny thoughts on if installing a company profile seems ok to you?? I am also thinking I might buy a cheap second phone to use only for work since they will reimburse me anyway.\n\nThanks!!",

In the last month I upgraded to the iPhone 16 (running iOS 26.0.1) and I have had a lot of problems with the stereo screen jumping back and forth between Apple Carplay and Dual's local OS. My iPhone 16 does not completely disconnect because if I am playing music, it will continue playing even though Apple CarPlay is disconnected according to the screen. Even if I do not touch the option on my stereo screen for Apple CarPlay it will jump back and forth automatically between the Dual OS home page and Apple CarPlay.   \n\n\nIs this a glitch with iOS 26, or is my stereo system malfunctioning, maybe a hardware compatibility issue with the iPhone 16?",

It feels like my finger is being slightly pressed in all the time – almost like there’s a built-in Popsocket or something pushing against it.\n\nIt’s especially noticeable when I’m typing or trying to use it one-handed. My finger keeps bumping into that ridge, and it honestly feels uncomfortable after a while.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this or is it just me? Curious if this is a common thing or if I just need to adjust my grip or change cases.\n\nAnd if yes is the Pro Max different because I have \"longer\" fingers and the 16 Pro was okay but since the Camera Plateau it feels weird idk.\n\nBest Regards",

The main screen is an awkward aspect ratio, but it's small, offering roughly the same real estate as an iPhone Mini.\n\nThese renders and concept art comes from MacRumors Forum user iZac:\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumoured-iphone-fold-size-concept-drawing-and-renders.2456447/",

I hear you loud and clear, I’ll buy a dedicated work phone 🫡.\n\nOriginal post below:\n\n Hi, I’m not sure this is the right sub for this but I started working for a new company that has a BYOD policy for phones. If I want to download and log into Teams, access email in Outlook, or even access the company intranet in Safari, I need to install this device profile. \n\nAt my last workplace they didn’t have this requirement. I was able to install and sign into work apps like normal.\n\nI’m concerned about the fact that my work will be able to see all the apps I have installed on my phone and have the ability to factory reset my phone.\n\nMy work doesn’t provide company phones but for my job I’m required to be reachable after hours and will reimburse me for phone service after enrolling into BYOD. This makes me feel like after installing this profile, my work basically has custody over my phone??\n\nAny thoughts on if installing a company profile seems ok to you?? I am also thinking I might buy a cheap second phone to use only for work since they will reimburse me anyway.\n\nThanks!!",

Yes the transparency is still distracting in some places but I haven't found one that's particularly offensive yet. I like the new lockscreen, and to my surprise the animation actually felt more polished and responsive than iOS 18.

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass – Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI missed the Titan 2 Kickstarter by just two days 😓 and have been trying to buy one since October — but so far, no luck placing a regular order.\n\nI’ve seen a few media and YouTube reviews, but I’m specifically looking for feedback from **actual users who backed it or got it after launch**, not influencer or press units.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Has *anyone in the general public* actually received their Titan 2 yet?\n2. If yes, how’s it holding up — build quality, battery, keyboard feel, software stability, camera, etc.?\n3. Has anyone been able to place a *new* post-Kickstarter order, or is it still locked as “notify me”?\n\nI’ve been refreshing the Unihertz site for weeks — wondering if there’s any news about when it’ll open up for wider purchase.\n\nWould love to hear honest impressions from real users. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Samsung is canceling the upcoming s26 edge completly. but should it?\n\nCurrent reports say its because of poor sales of the 25 edge (only 178k in the first month) vs the other s series (s25 ultra with 1.5m, s25 with more than 1m). \n\nFor my opinion, the poor sales of the s25 edge were caused only because thats a new technology and it was mostly a prototype phone.\nIt had many problems and seemed rushed and unfinished (wasnt that thin, small battery, no telephoto camera). It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 → LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B → JN5",

    "selftext": "Earlier this year I repaired my pixel 7 due to the “Black Screen of Death”. Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

No response at all, the car no longer saw the bluetooth, pressing and holding buttons did nothing, just dead. Wouldn't even show the \"charging\" icon when plugged in.\n\nI transferred the sim to the backup, synced the contacts, and went on with my trip. As a former work phone it had fewer apps installed and I didn't try to sync them over cellular. No Waze or podcasts, but I could still use Google maps, and did.  Three days later, same thing.  Stopped at an overlook, got out to take a photo and boom.\n\nHere's were it gets weirder (to me). Unloading the car after the trip I picked up the original phone an bumped a key or the screen and got the \"insufficient charge\" icon on the screen (battery with a sliver of red at the bottom). I plugged it in and is started charging and after I let it charge for a while it rebooted like nothing happened (after I put the sim back in it).\n\nWhat's the odds on the other doing the same? I used it as my camera for most of the vacation and would like to recover the photos if possible. It's been two days already, but I don't know how long its battery will hold out.  It's had less use and I don't know how long the other one took before the battery drained enough to break it out of what ever logic loop it was stuck in.",

As the smartphone was always used with a case, etc., it was in perfect condition apart from the reported fault (no other defects known, even took photos of it beforehand). During the repair process, I was informed yesterday that there were ‘audio problems’ and ‘frame cracks’, which would cost approximately 200€ to repair. However, these must be paid for, otherwise the display fault cannot be repaired.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a no-go business practice, as there was no visible damage to the Pixel other than the display fault.\n\nI have now requested a detailed damage report with photo documentation from Google, which I will forward to the European Consumer Protection Agency.\n\nThis will probably be my last Pixel.",

    "selftext": "I was just messing around with settings on my P10 Pro and I discovered an interesting setting. \n\nGames and emulators have been pretty meh on here so far.  Everyone assumed it's a driver issue.  And I think they're right because enabling something called ANGLE seems to improve performance and fixes compatibility for a lot of games.  Here's what I found:\n\nSettings-System-Developer Options-ANGLE Preferences (under Debugging).\n\nGo to the app you want to try and change the OpenGL driver from \"default\" to \"angle\".  Restart the app and give it a go.\n\n**My tests so far:**\n\nDolphin Emulator - Noticeably improved and more stable framerate in Star Fox Adventures and Metroid Prime.  These were both dropping sub-100% emulation speed.  After ANGLE is enabled, they haven't dropped below 100% speed.\n\nRunescape - Framerate and stability massively improved.  Graphical glitches disappeared.  Runs much, much better.\n\nsrceng (via idtech4a++) - Half Life 2 now works.  No more black textures, though there are some glitches still.  It was completely unplayable before this fix.  Portal unfortunately has a nasty flicker I can't seem to fix, but at least it runs now.\n\nOpenMW 0.50 - Seems to be quite a bit more stable with my modded setup.  Still some stutters here and there, but seems smoother overall.\n\nSubnautica - This ran ok to begin with, but it feels overall smoother and more stable with ANGLE enabled.\n\nI don't fully understand what this does, but I believe it's a translation layer between the GPU and Vulkan, translating each GPU call into something the GPU fully understands.  And since the PowerVR GPU drivers are currently buggy as hell, this fixes a lot of issues.\n\nI feel like this basically confirms a lot of the GPU issues are a driver issue (updated soon hopefully?!) since the translation layer fixes quite a bit from what I can tell.",

I used to plug the USB into each phone and let the setup copy off my old Pixel to my new Pixel.   \n  \nIs that still the case? I keep getting a QR code from them to back-up, but my Pixel 7 is already backed up to the cloud. \n\nThanks for any tips in advance.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, please pardon the long post, I am very excited for my phone. I am just about to graduate school and I proimised myself to get a new phone if I got a full time offer (which I did!) - Mint Mobile had the Pixel 10 Pro XL up for grabs for just $600, so I ended up getting Jade. I got the Otterbox Symmetry Case to show off the color.\n\nI prev. used a Pixel 6 with Spigen's Wallet case ([reference](https://partners.spigen.com/products/pixel-6-series-case-slim-armor-cs?variant=44016021471432)) - since my phone has my work ID and transit card, I'm fine if I forget my wallet, which I would like to continue.\n\nI wanted to get a matching snap-on wallet for the Jade 10 Pro XL, so I ordered:  \n\\- MOFT [Earthen Beige](https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Magnetic-Compatible-Adjustment-Magsafe/dp/B0DJ73FP6X?th=1): Unlike the images, I received a grey  thing.  \n  \n\\- So I have ordered MOFT's [Peach Pink](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDB1NFXC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1). I fear being a guy it will come off as girlish? Not that I care if it matches the phone well.\n\n\\- Bellroy has a Tahini color wallet too - [link](https://bellroy.com/products/mag-wallet?color=innovera_tahini&material=innovera#slide-0)\n\nThese are just a few I had shortlisted, but if by chance any of you had better recommendations that matches the gold-ish accents or just the jade colorway that will be much appreciated!",

It cashes at least once a week, where I will be doing anything even during a important call and it will just fully shut down and not turn on for about 10-20 minutes. One time it turned off for 8 hours. then randomly turned back on when I was about to bring it to a store. Each time it was at a decently high battery percentage \n\n\\-editing photos takes way too long. even cropping, or writing on images will take a minute sometimes.\n\n\\-I have deleted so many things so its not because storage or things running in the background\n\n\\-It is somehow worse in every way then my old Samsung a71? which is older and much cheaper? \n\n  \nIm so disappointed because I thought it was going to be a great phone and it was my first more expensive phone yet it did so terribly.

Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

Now when I am using for example Facebook Messenger, when I am chatting with someone and I want to send them a photo I click on the little photo icon to attach a photo. That pulls up my photo library. But, all my photos from the Pixel 4 show up there out of whack and in mostly reverse chronological order. Meaning the most recent ones are located at the bottom scrolling through thousands of older photos. Why does this happen and how do I fix this?",

As the smartphone was always used with a case, etc., it was in perfect condition apart from the reported fault (no other defects known, even took photos of it beforehand). During the repair process, I was informed yesterday that there were ‘audio problems’ and ‘frame cracks’, which would cost approximately 200€ to repair. However, these must be paid for, otherwise the display fault cannot be repaired.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a no-go business practice, as there was no visible damage to the Pixel other than the display fault.\n\nI have now requested a detailed damage report with photo documentation from Google, which I will forward to the European Consumer Protection Agency.\n\nThis will probably be my last Pixel.",

Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

Now I’m looking at the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra and wanted to hear from people who’ve spent time with them.\n\nOn paper they seem very close, but I’m curious about how they actually feel day to day. How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

But that was my fault to not have backup.\n\n\n\nAnyway, i gotten a cheap Xiaomi phone to use until i was back to my country since i acquired Samsung care+.\n\nOnce returned and submitted it to the Samsung costumer center they mentioned few times, it will be a free repair unless water damage is detected.\n\nOf course, i kept the phone relatively well, but it received its shares of water splashes, and knowing very well what waterproof mean in the phone world i was ready to pay the 93\\~USD of screen change out of warranty. (The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra? I guess i use it as a Dex PC. ",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality.

Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed.

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

    "selftext": "Bought my GW Ultra late last year when they were giving insane deals/trade-ins and was blown away by how good it was.  However, over the last few months, my HR has been becoming completely unusable as the numbers would jump around so much that I knew they weren't correct.  (I've been a distance runner for almost twenty years so I know my HR very well and I knew the watch was giving poor info.)  I've had a couple of forced resets of my watch and even starting over from scratch has not improved things.\n\nFor my birthday last week, I got a gift card to Amazon and I decided to finally purchase a HR monitor with a chest strap.  Found an unbelievable deal on one for only $20 and thought I'd try it.  Today, on its first run, I saw just how bad my Ultra was really performing.\n\nIn the pic below, the top picture is the still very new Ultra during a 2.5 mile run.  It climbs steadily until reaching my \"cruising\" HR, which will usually be between 145-155, depending on my exertion level that day.  The top pic is very acceptable to me.  I was doing a lot of HR zone training back then and with a good HR sensor, it was easily accomplished.\n\nThe bottom pic is today's run, a 1.55 mile treadmill run.  (Sorry, it was 38 degrees and raining, so not going outside!)  You can see a very similar HR pattern as the new Ultra had in the top pic.  A steady climb into the cruising zone and stayed there for the duration.  Never got above 150 the entire time.\n\nThe middle pic is yesterday's run, one mile on the treadmill using the Ultra only.  Wow, what a disaster.  All over the place and a couple of minute-long flatlines.  Also, notice the high of 171, which I know my heart never came near.  Definitely a cadence-lock issue, because my running cadence is always between 168 and 174.\n\nI'm one of those tactile-intolerant people and I thought for sure I'd hate running with this strap on my chest but I barely even noticed it the entire time.  The beauty is, once SportWerks has discovered the BLE device, it is stored and it will automatically find the device every time in the future so as long as I remember to put it on, it's as simple as that.\n\nNot sure why these things simply \"go bad\" but apparently, mine has.  Sharing this because I've seen enough posts from other runners/cyclists to know they are also having HR sensor issues.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn17yc8ijxwf1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a25d27193cc4e24239c1554d50b2a76870b84e\n\n",

Ongoing tasks will appear in the Now bar at the bottom of your watch face so you can check key information quickly.\n\nDo more with double pinch  \nJust pinch your thumb and index finger together twice to scroll through notifications, control music, take pictures, and more. You can also customize what happens when you double pinch on the watch face, music controller, as well as alarm, calendar, and reminder alerts. Choose the actions you need most in each situation.\n\nMark reminders as important  \nMark reminders as important by tapping the Star icon. You can choose to have important reminders pinned to the top of the list to make sure you notice them.\n\nNew charging effects  \nWhen your watch is charging, the new screen layout and animations make it easier to check the current battery level and remaining charging time.\n\n**Stay connected**\n\nEasily respond to notifications and alerts  \nUse gestures to quickly respond to notifications and alerts. When a notification appears, you can double pinch to view the details or send a reply. You can also shake your wrist to return to the watch face.\n\nEnhanced notification view  \nNotifications on your watch are now easier to use with an attractive new design. Notifications from the same app are stacked vertically, allowing you to view more notifications with fewer swipes.\n\nSmarter notification settings  \nIt's now easier to decide how to receive notifications from your phone on your watch. If you choose Smart device selection, notifications will appear on your phone only when you're using it and on your watch when you're not using your phone. If you choose Always show on both, notifications will always appear on both your phone and watch.\n\n**Upgrade your health**\n\nRunning coach  \nWhether you're a beginner or an experienced runner, the new Running coach feature in Samsung Health provides personalized training programs and tips to help you run farther and faster while minimizing the risk of injury.\n\nBedtime guidance  \nGet to sleep at the right time so you wake up feeling refreshed. The new Bedtime guidance feature analyzes your sleep data and recommends the best time to go to sleep each night.\n\nMindfulness  \nManage stress and anxiety in your daily life with the new Mindfulness feature in Samsung Health. You can keep track of your moods and emotions and practice breathing exercises to reduce stress.\n\n**Tailored to you**\n\nFind the perfect watch face  \nIt's now easier to find the watch face that's right for you. Just choose a few keywords such as your preferred style, color, and information to show. The best matches will be suggested from our collection of more than 300 watch faces.\n\nRecommended watch faces  \nDiscover new watch faces that you might like. Watch faces with colors, style, or information similar to your current watch face will be recommended on the watch face selection screen.\n\nCreate your own tiles  \nCreate your own custom tiles that show the information you need. You can even combine information from different apps into a single tile. You can include weather information, calendar events, reminders, and more.\n\nPersonalized Apps screen  \nFeatured apps now appear at the top of your Apps screen to give you quick access to the apps you need the most. Apps will be featured based on how often you use them and other usage patterns. You can also view your apps as a list with names instead of only icons.\n\nChoose calendars to show on your watch  \nYou can now choose which calendars to show in the Calendar app on your watch. You can show all of the same calendars that are on your phone or customize to show only the calendars you need.\n\n  \n**Sadly there are no any:**\n\n  \nTrack your vascular load  \nUse your Galaxy Watch to measure your vascular load, which is the amount of stress on your blood vessels. First, take a baseline measurement, then you'll be able to see when your vascular load gets higher or lower over time.  \n  \nCheck your antioxidant intake  \nThe Antioxidant index (Labs) feature on your watch detects the level of carotenoids in your skin. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant contained in fruits and vegetables that can help prevent physical aging.\n\nP.S. It's not bad update overall, but most important features as always Samsung hold just for Ultra models.",

Not everyone is into spending hundreds on a Smartwatch or Ring.\n\n\\-It has great battery life.  I'm fine with the shorter battery life of my Watch 7, but I know that none of these people I set up with a Fit 3 would put up with having to charge their watch every 1-2 days.\n\n\\-It's not bulky.  I don't consider my Watch 7 bulky either, certainly not compared to something like a Watch Ultra, but the Fit 3 is a truly lightweight device.\n\n\\-Has all the basic smartwatch features covered.  I'm amazed how well it integrates with Google Messages when receiving texts.  It's great that it still shows you when you are getting a call (even though you can't answer them).  It handles all the core health tracking.  Built-in find-your-phone feature, fall alerts, etc.\n\n\\-Low maintenance.  No apps that need to update constantly.  The Fit 3 itself turns on and off very quick.  This also makes it a great backup watch.  My old Watch 4 Classic on the other-hand, I have to turn it on periodically just to keep the apps updated and it takes a while, uses maybe 10% of the battery just finishing the boot-up process.\n\n  \nNow obviously each watch has it's own pros and cons, but the Fit 3 does a really great job at not just being a cheap watch, but actually doing certain things better than the more expensive watches and creating a great option to bring a big group of people into the Samsung smartwatch / Samsung health ecosystem.",

There I enter my credentials, complete 2FA and I get a screen saying:\n\nContinue with ********@*****.com\n\nApplicable service: Samsung Health\n\nContinue\n\nCancel\n\nI tap continue, and I am momentarily taken back to the Samsung Health app, I see a glimpse of something loading, and then I am taken back to the browser to the same \"Continue with ... \" screen, and then none of the two options to continue or to cancel work (I mean I tap them and they do nothing). If I go back to Samsung Health, the loading circle spins indefinitely and I actually have to close the app and I need to close it then open it up again, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nWhile I am still able to use my watch through the Galaxy Wearable app, this issue is severely impacting my experience, as I am basically blocked from using basic health features.\n\nI've tried all the usual troubleshooting steps: Clearing cache and data of Samsung Health, reinstalling Samsung Health, downloading, using a different browser (Samsung Internet instead of Google Chrome), restarting the phone. I am using a Redmi Note 12 running HyperOS 2.\n\nIf someone has any idea how to fix that, any help would be much appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "title": "Here's how I fixed up my galaxy watch 8c battery issue.",
    "selftext": "This is a post to help you folks who are stuck with a watch that dies in 8 hours.\n\nBefore I start, let me just clarify that I don't have a fixed solution for you. I'll tell you what I tried, and what worked.\n\nI got my galaxy watch 8c LTE edition on September 13th. Bought it from a store, enabled whatever I wanted, used it.\nIt took me a couple of days to realize that the battery dies within the day.\n\nI started measuring. I was wearing it to sleep, I was using it to exercise, I was using it like how a proper smart watch is supposed to be used. On an average I got 10-12 hours out of it. 10% battery drain per hour.\n\nI started looking into solutions. Searched reddit, forums, samsung issue resolutions.\n\nSome had this issue because of the Gemini constantly listening. Some had it because they had AOD on. But these folks already had a battery life that spanned atleast 20+ hours. This fix wasn't for me.\n\nThen the next group of people had a solution - clear the cache partition or do a factory reset. Or do both.\nFor some, the cache clear worked. For some the reset did. For some, doing both did it.\n\nSo started my 2 week long experimenting on improving battery life.\n\nClearing cahe partition didn't do much. I cleared again. Nothing.\nI reset the watch. Still showed 12 hours.\n\nSomeone pointed out to do it twice - no idea why - but tried that.\nStill the same.\n\nAfter 3 days of trial and error, my watch suddenly showed 22hrs.\nI didn't do anything much. I had cleared the partition and reset the watch earlier that day.\n\nHoping it would improve again, I repeated this process - twice.\nAfter setting it up as a new watch for God knows how many times, it switched back to showing 12-15h.\n\nHere is when I noticed that the battery drain has a direct correlation with the network settings.. \nI checked my connection settings - wifi, mobile data etc were set to auto. That would mean that when my phone was away, they would use what's needed and would be off when I'm using it with my phone nearby. \n\nBut it seemed that the watch was not turning it off. It was connected to my watch, but not always through bluetooth. It would switch sometimes to wifi and LTE even when the phone was in my pocket. \n\nThis was the root cause. Don't know what caused it, but my samsung phone was not exactly paired to my samsung watch.\n\nI cleared cache partition. That didn't do much. I hard reset the watch multiple times till I ensured it was pairing properly.\n\nAnd immediately I got 1day+12 hours battery life. That's the same amount as promised by samsung with everything on.\n\nAll you have to do is just check if only bluetooth is enabled on the watch menu while your phone is near.\n\nDo some hard resets, clear cache - as many times as needed to ensure only bluetooth icon is visible when phone is near. The wifi and LTE symbols should be off if you're normally wearing your watch. Update your settings to auto. This will get you 1.5 days of battery life with AOD off. If you need more than 36 hours of battery life, then do the things others did - turn off AOD, switch off Gemini, set heart rate to measure every 10 mins etc. that's gonna get u that 2 day battery life.\n\n I still don't know why or what's causing it. Maybe my phone has too many bluetooth devices connected to it. Maybe my watch hates my phone in secret. Who knows. But this should fix it.\n\ntldr; read last 3 paragraphs. Good luck.\n\nPS : not a native English speaker. Sorry for the language.\n\n",

The 40mm fits better on my wrist but if i would cancel my order id have to pay 339€ instead of the 259 i wouldve payed for the watch. Ive got quite a slim wrist and now my question is, would the 44mm would fit good if i would use other bands then the Standard one? I ofc i like the 44mm better because it has more battery and a bigger screen tho, the 40mm looks better on my wrist but if it still wouldnt fit better with other bands i might have to pay 80€ more to get the 40mm at standard price :( please let me know if anyone ever encounterd this problem",

I find the former more attractive but both seem to have similar activity and health metrics, which I'm more interested in.\n\nI'm swimming (pool and open water) and will start running; both not rigorously/competitive but for good health. I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

I bought an expensive (for me at least) watch8 classic because it looks like a classic watch and I want it to behave like one as well. I don't want any black screen if I move my wrist, no shaking no nothing! \n\nThe only way this bloody thing stops turning off the screen when I move my wrist is if I have the screen on \"always on\". I don't want that. I want it to turn off after 30 sec that I actually chosed in the settings. \n\nI'm about to return this awful thing and go back to Garmin. I'm so frustrated. \n\nIf someone can help me with this I would be forever grateful. ",

    "title": "Knew my Ultra HR sensor was messed up but this is shockingly bad.",
    "selftext": "Bought my GW Ultra late last year when they were giving insane deals/trade-ins and was blown away by how good it was.  However, over the last few months, my HR has been becoming completely unusable as the numbers would jump around so much that I knew they weren't correct.  (I've been a distance runner for almost twenty years so I know my HR very well and I knew the watch was giving poor info.)  I've had a couple of forced resets of my watch and even starting over from scratch has not improved things.\n\nFor my birthday last week, I got a gift card to Amazon and I decided to finally purchase a HR monitor with a chest strap.  Found an unbelievable deal on one for only $20 and thought I'd try it.  Today, on its first run, I saw just how bad my Ultra was really performing.\n\nIn the pic below, the top picture is the still very new Ultra during a 2.5 mile run.  It climbs steadily until reaching my \"cruising\" HR, which will usually be between 145-155, depending on my exertion level that day.  The top pic is very acceptable to me.  I was doing a lot of HR zone training back then and with a good HR sensor, it was easily accomplished.\n\nThe bottom pic is today's run, a 1.55 mile treadmill run.  (Sorry, it was 38 degrees and raining, so not going outside!)  You can see a very similar HR pattern as the new Ultra had in the top pic.  A steady climb into the cruising zone and stayed there for the duration.  Never got above 150 the entire time.\n\nThe middle pic is yesterday's run, one mile on the treadmill using the Ultra only.  Wow, what a disaster.  All over the place and a couple of minute-long flatlines.  Also, notice the high of 171, which I know my heart never came near.  Definitely a cadence-lock issue, because my running cadence is always between 168 and 174.\n\nI'm one of those tactile-intolerant people and I thought for sure I'd hate running with this strap on my chest but I barely even noticed it the entire time.  The beauty is, once SportWerks has discovered the BLE device, it is stored and it will automatically find the device every time in the future so as long as I remember to put it on, it's as simple as that.\n\nNot sure why these things simply \"go bad\" but apparently, mine has.  Sharing this because I've seen enough posts from other runners/cyclists to know they are also having HR sensor issues.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn17yc8ijxwf1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a25d27193cc4e24239c1554d50b2a76870b84e\n\n",

Not everyone is into spending hundreds on a Smartwatch or Ring.\n\n\\-It has great battery life.  I'm fine with the shorter battery life of my Watch 7, but I know that none of these people I set up with a Fit 3 would put up with having to charge their watch every 1-2 days.\n\n\\-It's not bulky.  I don't consider my Watch 7 bulky either, certainly not compared to something like a Watch Ultra, but the Fit 3 is a truly lightweight device.\n\n\\-Has all the basic smartwatch features covered.  I'm amazed how well it integrates with Google Messages when receiving texts.  It's great that it still shows you when you are getting a call (even though you can't answer them).  It handles all the core health tracking.  Built-in find-your-phone feature, fall alerts, etc.\n\n\\-Low maintenance.  No apps that need to update constantly.  The Fit 3 itself turns on and off very quick.  This also makes it a great backup watch.  My old Watch 4 Classic on the other-hand, I have to turn it on periodically just to keep the apps updated and it takes a while, uses maybe 10% of the battery just finishing the boot-up process.\n\n  \nNow obviously each watch has it's own pros and cons, but the Fit 3 does a really great job at not just being a cheap watch, but actually doing certain things better than the more expensive watches and creating a great option to bring a big group of people into the Samsung smartwatch / Samsung health ecosystem.",

I find the former more attractive but both seem to have similar activity and health metrics, which I'm more interested in.\n\nI'm swimming (pool and open water) and will start running; both not rigorously/competitive but for good health. I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

    "title": "HELP: Technical Insight on Laptop Not Charging?",
    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nA couple of months back my Lenovo Yoga slim suddenly stopped charging properly. When plugged in it would remain at the same charge but never increase. If I drained the battery completely I could then charge the laptop back to full as long as it wasn’t turned. \n\nTried everything I could find to fix it across the internet, but gave up after a few weeks and bought a new Lenovo Thinkbook. Was fine for a month or so but now the laptop won’t charge at all.\n\nNot looking for help per se, but just wanted to ask out of curiosity -\n\n*Question* ————————\n\nWhat generally causes laptop batteries to improperly interface with the rest of the machine? And why does it seem to randomly / suddenly occur?\n\nI.e are drivers faulty? Are there defects in the battery? Has the hardware been damaged in some way? Or a mix of all the above?\n\nHonestly just curious, no pressure for anyone to answer and no worries if no one really knows.\n\n",

He mainly uses laptop for working so powerpoint, word documents, internet searching, Zoom meetings etc. He also liked photography and would like to be able to upload his pictures to his laptop and do some light editing (nothing too advanced though). He doesn’t like Macbooks/Apple I think due to his age he is a Windows man. \n\nI have been looking at the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 as a good option for him, as it has great reviews online. Do you think this would work? \n\nHe wants it to have good longevity as his problem at the moment is laptops don’t seem to last very long for him before they are slow and difficult to use. Thanks! \n",

I get frustrated especially since its brand new but im like okay shit happens whatever. My main issue is when I took the laptop to the repair they told me the motherboard is messed up and they couldn't find a single motherboard out of the 100s they have that fit into my laptop, and tell me that HP is making laptops that cant be fixed. Now im left with a brand new laptop thats for the bin and a huge amount of work piled up, with the cheapest good laptops being 600 to 700. What a waste man",

    "subreddit": "laptops",
    "title": "What laptop should I buy?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I’m planning to buy a new laptop soon, and I could really use some advice before making the final decision. My budget is around **$600 USD** or less, and I’m looking for a laptop that performs well, looks good, and works smoothly for daily tasks. I mainly need it for **work**, which involves a lot of **video calls**, so a decent **built-in webcam** is actually one of my top priorities. I also tend to have multiple apps and browser tabs open at once, so smooth **multitasking** is really important to me.\n\nOutside of work, I’d like the laptop to handle some casual gaming from time to time. It would be nice if it could run a few games comfortably without overheating or lagging. I also spend a fair amount of time streaming shows and videos, editing documents and presentations, and maybe doing some basic photo or video editing here and there when needed. Overall, I’m looking for a laptop that can handle everyday tasks with ease while still being enjoyable and comfortable to use.\n\nI’ve already done a bit of research and found a few models that seem to fit my needs, but I’m still not sure which one offers the best overall value. I’ll list them below with their prices, along with some quick notes on what I’ve found so far, but I’d love to hear your thoughts or any recommendations you might have.\n\n**$450 USD Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15IAH8**\\- 15.6\" FHD (TN, 250 nits) Intel Core i5-12450H (8 cores, 12 threads), 8GB (soldered) DDR5, 512GB SSD M.2 2242, 1080p Webcam, WiFi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 , Windows 11 Home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the laptop's material feels cheap, it gets hot quickly, and the battery doesn't last long. It also struggles with gaming and can shut down randomly. While positive reviews say the image quality and Dolby audio are decent, and the camera is great for video calls. The performance is acceptable for work and school. It opens programs fast and charges quickly.\n\nThe second laptop is the same Lenovo laptop but it's the one with an **AMD Ryzen 5 7520U** processor, it does have some other differences so these are the full specs: AMD Ryzen 5 7520U (4C/8T, 2.8/4.3GHz, 2MB L2/4MB L3) 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe NVMe | 15.6\" matte screen | Windows 11 Home (and Pro on another site). Camera: HD 720p with a privacy shutter.\n\nNegative reviews say that the display isn’t very bright, that it lacks touch functionality, and that the colors have a slight greenish tint. They trash the webcam, saying it's only 720p and not great. The hinge goes all the way back, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. The fan can get noisy during gameplay too.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has an impressive battery life, lasting about 10-11 hours with regular use. The 1080p display is decent, and the built-in speakers sound pretty good. The keyboard is snappy, and the large trackpad is accurate. It has a fingerprint reader for extra security, and you can even open the laptop with one hand.\n\n**$550 Acer Aspire Lite** 15.6\" FHD, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 8 cores Windows 11 Home | integrated AMD Radeon Graphics. DDR4 3200 MHz M.2 PCLE NVMe.\n\nAccording to some reviews, the battery life isn't that good, like 4-5 hours. This is the laptop that the sales clerk recommended. They said the camera quality is decent (like a normal one you would get at this price range).\n\n**$530 ASUS Vivobook Go 15** | AMD Ryzen 5 7520U | 16GB | 512GB SSD | 15.6\" | Windows 11 Home | 2.8GHz (6MB Cache, up to 4.3GHz, 4 cores, 8 Threads) FHD 60 Hz AMD Radeon Web Camera 720p.\n\nNegative reviews say that the fans are slightly loud. It's not suitable for video and photo editing. The webcam is mediocre, not the best one, basically.\n\nPositive reviews say that the battery lasts 7 hours and it charges fully in 1 hour. One review even said that the webcam quality was decent enough.\n\n**$550 ASUS Vivobook 15** AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD 8 cores integrated AMD Radeon Graphics - 15.6″ FHD windows 11 home.\n\nNegative reviews say that the battery life is not quite long enough to last a full day of work or classes. 1080p display has a cool tint, and it’s heavy at 3.8 pounds.\n\nPositive reviews say that the laptop has above-average build quality and, reliable fingerprint reader on its trackpad. Its backlit keyboard was quiet and satisfying to type on, and its trackpad worked well.\n\nI don't know if this changes anything, but I'm based in Latin America, so do with that information what you will. Thank you in advance!",

I have seen some people on this subreddit have the same problem but they only showed the key already in the keyboard, so I figured out that perhaps showing it from (almost) the stard could be more usefull.\n\nIs there something that I can do or I need to buy a new keyboard or something in that line?\n\nThanks in advandce!! 😁",

A bit more info, once I took it off charge, the heat started to cooldown and after 15 mins it’s okay and I haven’t plugged it back in. Also, I checked the task manager and it said everything was okay (was using ChatGPT to check cuz I don’t know much about computers), also temp said was only 46degrees Celsius. Anyway my question is, does anyone happen to know what’s going on, if it’s normal or there’s a problem with the charger or advice on what to do. Would be much appreciated thank you,",

My current old laptop is painfully slow and killing my motivation to study. Need something reliable and fast for research (tons of tabs!), writing, etc.\n* **Aspiring Content Creator:** Starting an Instagram project focused on nutrition and fitness videos (think short reels/stories, editing footage from my phone). Need a machine that can handle video editing smoothly (using DaVinci Resolve/Premiere Pro level software).\n* **Budget & Risk:** My total budget is tight (around $1500 USD equivalent *total* for everything, PC related). These laptops eat a significant chunk. I recently cancelled a PC build due to indecision and rising costs, so I'm really anxious about making the *right*, *safe* choice this time. Risk of hardware failure *really* worries me. I also want to buy a cell phone since mine broke. But I don't want to be left with nothing in my pocket either.\n* **Priorities:** Need something **modern** with a **great screen** for visual work. Performance for editing is key. Portability isn't the *top* priority anymore, but decent battery is good.\n\n**The Contenders:**\n\n**Option 1: HP EliteBook 840 G11 (Used - \"Like New\")**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$400 USD (Argentine Pesos equivalent: \\~$750k ARS)\n* **CPU:** Intel Core **Ultra 7 165U** (12c/14h) - Latest gen, efficient but powerful.\n* **RAM:** **32 GB DDR5** (Awesome for multitasking!)\n* **SSD:** 512 GB NVMe\n* **GPU:** Intel Arc Graphics\n* **Screen:** 14\" WUXGA (1920x1200) IPS (Confirmed NOT the dreaded HD!)\n* **Condition:** Used (looks pristine in pics), claims excellent battery life (5-6+ hrs).\n* **PROS:** **Amazing RAM amount & speed**, latest Ultra 7 CPU, premium EliteBook build, great price for the specs.\n* **CONS (The HUGE one):** **ZERO WARRANTY.** If it breaks, I lose \\~$400 USD and my main tool. Seller is straightforward about this. High risk.\n\n**Option 2: HP Pavilion Plus 14 (ew1000la - BRAND NEW)**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$650 USD (Argentine Pesos equivalent: \\~$1.2M ARS)\n* **CPU:** Intel Core **Ultra 5 125H** (14c/18h - \"H\" series, better for sustained performance like rendering!)\n* **RAM:** 16 GB LPDDR5X (Soldered, very fast but **only 16GB**)\n* **SSD:** 512 GB NVMe\n* **GPU:** Intel Arc Graphics (likely slightly better version due to \"H\" CPU)\n* **Screen:** **14\" 2.8K (2880x1800) OLED, 120Hz VRR** (Absolutely gorgeous, perfect for visual work!)\n* **Condition:** **BRAND NEW.**\n* **PROS:** **NEW with 1-Year HP Warranty** (Huge peace of mind!), **stunning OLED screen**, more powerful CPU for rendering, zero risk initially.\n* **CONS:** **Only 16GB RAM** (will I regret this for heavy editing/multitasking?), **significantly more expensive** (\\~$250 USD difference is huge for me), eats much more of my safety net budget.\n\n**My Dilemma:**\n\nThe EliteBook G11 feels like incredible value spec-wise, especially that 32GB DDR5 RAM for juggling studies and editing. But the **lack of warranty terrifies me.** Given my budget constraints and past indecision, a hardware failure would be devastating.\n\nThe Pavilion Plus 14 is **safe, has that dream OLED screen**, and arguably a better CPU for my main creative task (rendering). But is 16GB of (fast) RAM *really* enough for smooth 4K phone footage editing + having browser tabs/study materials open? And is that safety + screen worth the extra \\~$250 USD and halving my RAM?\n\nWhich path is smarter for someone in my shoes? Do I gamble on the used powerhouse, or invest more in the safer, visually stunning (but potentially RAM-limited) new machine?\n\nThanks so much for any advice!",

I could hotspot instead of wired tether but hotspot then drains my phone absurdly quickly (and making me plug it into the laptop to charge again.)\n\n  \nIs there any way to accomplish this?\n\nI know I can get a battery bank and hotspot or get specific data only cables but just wondering if there are options where I don't have to buy more and bring them with me haha.\n\nPhone in use: Pixel 8 Pro\n\nLaptop in use: Macbook Pro 14 2024\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "I just changed the battery for my lenovo laptop and I want it to last for as many years as possible. I have read some contradicting articles abput what's best and what's harmful and now I'm more confused about what I should do. So please tell me if these measures are all necessary and have an impact on battery life:\n\n1. I have finished calibrating my battery for the first time (charging to 100%, discharging to 0%, charging it again to 100%). They say I should do this periodically, like once a month or so.\n2. I have set my charging threshold at min 40% and max 60%. Some people say 80% is a scam and needs to be lower, like at 60%, others (like the manufacturers themselves) recommend 80%.\n3. I keek my laptop raised with a stand that leaves plenty of room for ventilation (it doesn't have a fan, it's kinda like this [https://makerbazar.in/cdn/shop/products/LaptpStand.jpg?v=1676983144](https://makerbazar.in/cdn/shop/products/LaptpStand.jpg?v=1676983144) ).\n4. I have activated the modern standby mode to save energy.\n\nAlso, I mainly use my laptop at my desk, so I have it plugged in most of the time. Is this wrong? Am I killing my battery? Should I disconnect it even if I have set the charging threshold?\n\nAnd the last point I need explaining because I read about it and couldn't understand a thing is about charge cycles. If I partially charge my laptop (say from 80 to 100%, or 30 to 90%), is that considered a charge cycle? Why should I care/know about charge cycles? Should I try to minimize the number of charge cycles? Does this have a significant impact on how long will my battery last?\n\n  \nOh and I don't know if this is a good battery life or not, but I got this computer in 2019 I think and the battery started to suck like last year, but I never bother to change it because I don't often use it unplugged.\n\nThank you so much in advance for all your help!",

    "selftext": "I’m thinking about buying a used Dell Precision 5560 for around $700, and before I make the decision I wanted to hear some opinions from people who’ve owned or used it for a while. The one I found comes with an Intel Core i7-11800H, an NVIDIA RTX A2000, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD, and a 4K display. On paper it seems like a really solid workstation, but I’ve read some mixed experiences online, and I’m trying to figure out if it’s actually a good buy in 2025 or if it’s better to look for something else around the same price.\n\n\n\nI’m a multimedia student, and my main goal is to get a laptop that can handle my university work smoothly without freezing or overheating. The kind of things I’ll be using it for are mostly graphic design in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, plus some light video editing in Premiere Pro, After Effects, and DaVinci Resolve. There will also be a little bit of 3D work in Blender, but just for learning and small class projects, nothing professional or heavy rendering work. So overall, most of my workload is focused on graphic design and basic motion graphics, not full-scale 3D or VFX production.\n\n\n\nWhat worries me a bit is that I’ve seen quite a few people mention thermal throttling, high temperatures, and occasional freezes or lag that make the Precision 5560 feel slow under load. I also read that it uses a MUX-less design, meaning the NVIDIA GPU runs through the Intel one, which might cause delays or performance issues in some programs. I’m not very tech-savvy, so I’m not sure how much of this is still true today, maybe Dell fixed it with BIOS or driver updates?\n\n\n\nSo my main questions are: do these issues still happen with the latest updates, or is it mostly an old problem? Would this laptop still be a good fit for a multimedia student like me, considering my focus is on design and moderate editing work? And if anyone knows whether the Precision 5560 would actually help with the kind of programs I’ll be using in university, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts. I’m just looking for something stable that runs smoothly for several years without constant problems. Any advice or experience would mean a lot.",

    "selftext": "I have an HP Pavilion 15-ec0013dx. Last week, I started getting an 90b cooling fan error every time I turned the laptop on. When I hit enter to continue with startup process, it would load for like 10 minutes before my screen went blue with another error message saying that startup couldn't be completed. I scoured the internet looking for advice on how to fix it. I tried just about everything. Hard reset wasn't helpful. The fan was not dirty or broken and was properly connected. It still ran fine when the laptop was turned on, but I replaced it anyway. It started working again for like 2 days, but then the cooling fan error came back. I replaced the thermal paste. There was no BIOS update available for my model, and my computer wouldn't allow me to reset the BIOS to it's default settings. I'm not very technologically inclined, so maybe I was doing that part wrong, idk. I ran every test through my laptop's built-in Hardware Diagnostics, and everything passed accept for the cooling system test, which passed on fan speed, but failed on temperature. So I just decided to try again in a few days and I put everything away away. Well, it's been 3 days since I last attempted to fix my problem, so I decided to give it another go. But when I plugged in my laptop, the charging indicator light didn't come on, and it would not power on. I am so confused. The last time I ran tests, everything was functioning properly except for the fan. It said the battery was in great condition, and being as it was just replaced a little over a year ago, it definitely should be. The charging port isn't dirty, and there's no way for it to have gotten damaged while it was put away. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the charger that I can tell, and it was working fine just a few days ago. I'm at a loss. Any tips? Or should I just give up and accept that I'll be buying a new laptop this tax season? ",

I use the laptop for a month and a half taking care of it and being very careful with it during a presentation I have at work the laptop screen goes off and the caps lock starts blinking 5 long, 3 short. I get frustrated especially since its brand new but im like okay shit happens whatever. My main issue is when I took the laptop to the repair they told me the motherboard is messed up and they couldn't find a single motherboard out of the 100s they have that fit into my laptop, and tell me that HP is making laptops that cant be fixed. Now im left with a brand new laptop thats for the bin and a huge amount of work piled up, with the cheapest good laptops being 600 to 700. What a waste man",

And why does it seem to randomly / suddenly occur?\n\nI.e are drivers faulty? Are there defects in the battery? Has the hardware been damaged in some way?

    "selftext": "I always deal with and use HP products and never have I ever had a problem with them up until now. I recently bought an HP slim 15 laptop with really good specs at a discounted price from HP dealer selling at Noon (uae). The laptop arrives and the first issue I see is the keyboard clearly doesn't belong to the laptop extra buttons and so on, im like thats fine I need it for my work I dont really mind a visual issue. I use the laptop for a month and a half taking care of it and being very careful with it during a presentation I have at work the laptop screen goes off and the caps lock starts blinking 5 long, 3 short. I get frustrated especially since its brand new but im like okay shit happens whatever. My main issue is when I took the laptop to the repair they told me the motherboard is messed up and they couldn't find a single motherboard out of the 100s they have that fit into my laptop, and tell me that HP is making laptops that cant be fixed. Now im left with a brand new laptop thats for the bin and a huge amount of work piled up, with the cheapest good laptops being 600 to 700. What a waste man",

My main issue at the moment is I don't really know what cpu I should pair with my parts.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm working with a strict budget but a 7800x3D is out of the question lol. I mainly play games so I don't need anything super crazy. I've heard the ryzen 5 7600 is a good cpu for the price. I'm a little clueless as to what is actually good compared to what I've just heard on the internet. \n\nI don't even know if the parts I've already bought are even that good. I just got what I liked the look of and what I thought was reasonable. (I went overboard on my mobo but I went for the look more than anything. Same with my 3080 vision oc). \n\nHow much does ram matter? I will buy something ddr5 but what's even good? Should I splurge out on some corsair kit or could I save some and go for a crucial kit? How much does branding matter for ram and what's the difference between CL30, CL36 etc.?\n\nAny help at all would be greatly appreciated as I'm quite new to this. All my knowledge so far as been done through my own research so I'm not sure how good it is. \n\nThanks!",

I would buy the new ARGB version.

Do you recommend upgrading to the Arctic Freezer III Pro, or should I look for another AIO?",

This build was put together by someone else I no longer talk to, and I have no idea where to start to fix it. \n\nPart List:\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/JnGhKq\n\nI had been having sporadic issues with the computer shutting down at random, mostly when trying to run a second monitor at a different resolution or when playing poorly optimized alpha versions of indie games. I updated the graphics card & reseated the cables which temporarily helped. Today, I was opening Gmail when the computer again went black & now I cannot get it to boot. The CPU cooler lights up when powered on and I have what I believe are the DRAM and CPU red lights on the motherboard lit up, but nothing else powers up. I tried reseating the RAM again but the error did not clear. I looked up some old Reddit posts but I am going to be honest I need someone to ELI5 because those tutorials were all Greek to me.\n\nAlso open to suggestions of some reputable places to take the PC to get looked at if this feels like something I probably cannot figure out myself.",

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case. \n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well. \n\n\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**",

    "selftext": "I’ve put together an [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3TF2DPQ120GPQ?ref_=wl_share) for my build (parts listed below). I’m not looking for much criticism on the overall build unless it’s genuinely valuable input—I mainly have a few questions and   \nclarifications.\n\n1. I originally picked the **RTX 5070 Ti**, but since this [MSI RTX 5080](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Graphics-DisplayPort-Blackwell-Architecture/dp/B0DSX9Y24P?crid=1ANQJB2GHJ97T&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UHZUIztdnvxcNlqPrrOJ-OFU0y3H9_NbAJezorgSJ-OohPamWGhuP_rrzK2ORg0aow4bHnSWyHx2LUkO-kXqjwvNU0zZ9Hp-ZpEQbvDIsB7WUh6XKfssCxweM06tA_uPHWMH5ngtAw4fuOrgMkqJ2xknaMNuJoyR3i7rR2c3l2PSDwrjsR0IMfYIoQJam3e44UTHYLPg2gNnapq9iGFY1phVpbVcd_FYlg_5OZv7TmZlQbC5YHDfrjmMXtpC0Vspj6MgnUcEp71Sjs-ETzTxnuH8IjTJGgvmdg4rlnBlUtM.AWNXtmGP6y1hCp2xAo62DLTicQF32385dirJkeVanuw&dib_tag=se&keywords=5080+nvidia&qid=1761309812&s=electronics&sprefix=5080+nv%2Celectronics%2C4077&sr=1-24) is only \\~$200 more, I’m wondering why it’s priced so low. It’s MSI-branded, looks great, and seems solid—so is there a catch? Does it underperform, or is it just a good deal?\n2. I know the **motherboard** (MSI MPG X870E Carbon WiFi) is kind of overkill, but I love the extra 10G USB ports—I always run out—and it’s one of the best-looking boards next to the Hatsune Miku one (lol). Should I stick with it for future-proofing, or can I safely downgrade to something cheaper without losing much?\n3. My **case** (Lian Li O11 Vision) doesn’t include fans. I’d like to keep the branding consistent for RGB syncing, so I was planning on using **Lian Li Infinity fans**. Are they good enough performance-wise, or should I look at something else?\n4. I’m set on the **TRYX Panorama 360 AIO**—can I easily swap out its fans for Lian Li ones (or another brand)? Will I need multiple controllers for all the fans, or is syncing everything through one ecosystem manageable both hardware- and software-wise?\n5. Lastly, with the glass-top setup, I only have room for a 360mm AIO on near the front, another 360mm on the bottom, and a 240mm radiator in the back. Any input on fan placement or airflow for that layout?\n\nSorry if these are basic questions—I’ve done plenty of research, but I still want to be sure before pulling the trigger.  \n  \nBuild List:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* MSI Gaming RTX 5070 Ti 16G MLG Edition OC (considering RTX 5080)\n* MSI MPG X870E Carbon WiFi Motherboard\n* Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 32GB (2x16GB) 6400MHz\n* Samsung 990 Pro 2TB SSD\n* MSI MPG A1250GS PCIe5 Fully Modular 1250W PSU\n* TRYX Panorama 360 ARGB 360mm AIO (6.67\" AMOLED Curved Screen)\n* Lian Li O11 Vision (three-sided tempered glass, dual-chamber ATX mid tower)\n\n",

    "selftext": "I consider buying a 4TB SSD to extend the storage of my MacBook. Now both the WD Black SN7100 and SN850X, as well as Samsung 990 Plus/Pro are on sale. From my understanding the difference within each brand is DRAM vs. DRAMless. \n\nThe drive should primarily serve to store photos and videos (4k) that I want to edit directly on. I want to encrypt the drive with VeraCrypt, if that matters for the choice.\n\nSo some considerations I have:\n1. It's in an external enclosure, will DRAM even be used? Is there a noticeable difference in real life, especially for example when scrolling/searching through footages very fast in DaVinci Resolve. \n2. Longevity is important, as it should also serve as a backup drive. Does DRAM make a difference? Any brand/model that is especially durable? \n3. If DRAM is irrelevant, the DRAMless SSDs seem to have better thermals. Will this improve longevity or performance? Especially since it will be inside an enclosure without optimal air flow. \n4. The price difference is about 10%, which I think is neglectible, better buy once instead of regretting.\n\nAnything else to consider? \nThanks you all! ",

I was originally with a 3700X.\n\nThis is the current state of my 7-year old B450 Aorus Pro\n\n* Slot A1 does not work for some reason\n* Original CMOS battery is already dead\n* I removed the RAM last night and my PC stopped posting. It took me 15+ RAM reseats and 5+ attempts to reset CMOS to get it working again.\n\nOutside that I'm not seeing any other issues. It kept crashing when running emulators but that's likely because I was running slot A2-B1-B2 originally. Now I am stuck at a 16GB system just so I can maintain a dual-channel configuration. So I kinda want to replace my motherboard with a B550 and a brand new 2x16GB.\n\nQuestion: Is this a good idea? Or should I try to squeeze more life out of the motherboard just to save money? I'm happy with my system's current performance (RTX 4070, 144Hz 1080P ultrawide, still get 100+fps on games). So there is actually no functional need for me to upgrade. But I am worried once this 7-year old mobo actually says goodbye I'd be stuck with the inconvenience versus replacing the mobo now.\n\nThe reason why I don't want to switch to AM5 is because my 5700X3D is pretty new.\n\nThoughts? Has anyone ever switched from an B450 to a B550 and seen tangible performance difference?",

I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

    "title": "First build, what do I do for cooling? +other assorted question",
    "selftext": "Build list (so far):\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/X2d8pK](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/X2d8pK)\n\n  \nI picked out what I believe to be a solid selection of parts, but I'm stuck on cooling and have some worry about ordering everything only to have parts not work together. PCpartpicker does say there isn't any compatibility issues, but if anyone has input on what I've picked and/or recommendations for changes I'm all ears.\n\nThe main use case is gonna be mild-intense gaming, but likely will be used as a general workstation for photo editing, 3d modeling/splicing, and potentially coding among other tasks. Gaming sessions would span from 1-10+ hours depending on the day.\n\nBudget is $2-3k, preferably closer to $2.5k if possible without performance losses. This budget includes only the hardware in the tower itself. (note: build list does not include a CPU cooler and fans *yet,* and yes I'm aware of where the price is already, that's why I'm here)\n\n\n\nMy concerns with a build are:\n\nCooling - Main worry, and also the only thing I'm missing. I'd preferably like headroom for overclocking. I would like to use a 240 or 280mm radiator mounted along the top of the case, but if necessary a 360 on the front would do just fine. I noticed some people complaining about Corsair liquid coolers, are they really that bad? If so what're my cost effective options?\n\nCost vs Performance - Second main worry here. Am I way overkill on any of these parts? Could I cut back on some, or beef up others? I don't want to spend money if the gains are *too* negligible, but I also wouldn't mind going over budget.\n\nGPU/CPU - Playing on a laptop for years now, and starting to get tired of choppy or inconsistent framerates and diminishing CPU power. I would like to be able to run 1080p, 1440p, and possibly 4k on certain titles along with 60+ fps on medium-high/ultra graphics settings. I also play a handful of CPU intensive games such as Rimworld, Civ 6, and city skylines. I'm hoping the AMD 9800x3d + 5070ti combo will do justice in those departments, but thoughts?\n\nCompatibility - Will any of my selected parts have issues with each other? From what I can gather online, it would work fine, but is there better options that would optimize the work being done by the computer or is that not really an issue here?\n\nMotherboard - In the realm of boards I'm relatively clueless. Is the one I chose overkill, or is it on par for wanting to overclock my hardware?\n\n  \nFeel free to completely shit on my build to if its really that bad. If you do, a push in the right direction would be nice, as I really struggled to find a starting point when working out a case and the CPU/GPU/MB.\n\nIf I missed anything just ask, I'll try to reply fairly quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve got a PC that I built around 5 years ago, mainly for gaming but also for some casual web browsing and photo editing. It’s been solid overall, but lately I’ve noticed that my photo editing workflow feels sluggish, especially in Lightroom Classic.\n\nHere are my current specs:\n\n* Ryzen 5 5600X\n* ASUS TUF RTX 3070\n* 32GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM\n\nGaming-wise, I’m fine — I don’t play as many AAA titles anymore, and when I do (like Battlefield), I get around 80–90 FPS, which is decent for me. My main issue is with editing performance. In Lightroom Classic, moving between images can sometimes take a couple of seconds to load, and basic adjustments occasionally lag. It really breaks the flow when I’m trying to go through a big batch of photos.\n\nI mostly use:\n\n* **Lightroom Classic** (main)\n* **Photoshop**\n* **Luminar Neo** (occasionally)\n* **DaVinci Resolve** (rarely)\n\nI know GPUs help with AI-based tools and certain effects, but I’m trying to figure out if upgrading to a much better CPU (like one of the new Ryzen X3D models) plus a stronger GPU (like a 5070 Ti or 5080), along with DDR5 RAM, would noticeably improve performance in Lightroom/Photoshop — or if what I’m experiencing is mostly a software limitation that won’t change much even with top-tier hardware.\n\nBasically:\n\n* Will a high-end upgrade make Lightroom feel significantly smoother (instant image switching, faster brush and masking tools, etc.)?\n* Or is this just how Lightroom is, no matter what hardware you throw at it?\n* And should I even consider switching to a Mac if optimization is the main issue?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s upgraded recently or switched platforms and can share what actually made a difference.",

Would like to tie down my options before buying parts on Black Friday. \n\n\n\nUsage wise, it is mainly for gaming on 1440p and maybe light editing. I play anything from AAA to indie, from CIV to vampire survivors, not really into competitive shooter but do play from time to time. I will also be using 2 1440p monitors, one to play while netflix/surfing on the other at the same time. I don't intend to OC or chase maximum frame rate, i am however hoping to play on Ultra settings for once. (my current potatoes is so bad that that the flyover wasn't able to load and i fell to the streets below mid-race in NFS Unbound with low settings...but i digress)\n\n\n\nPSU wise, my power consumption measure to around 700W, some guides says 850W is more than enough but other guides says it is better to have 1.5X. Not sure if i can make do with 850W or better to get a 1000W. \n\n\n\nCost wise, i know i am wasting a lot of money into aesthetic and white tax, money that can be better spent on performance instead. I just have a hard time finding a case that i like. Maybe i should be looking into panel-less matx case instead. For mobo, i am looking for something with wifi 7. I am also spending more for future proofing, hoping the new build can last another 8-10 years.\n\n\n\nPlease ignore the price, it is going to cost so much moooooore in where i am.  I would appreciate if you can see if there is any bottlenecking or better suggestion for any thing.  \n\nThanks !\n\n\n\n\\[PCPartPicker Part List\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/DpPmXR)\n\n\n\nType|Item|Price\n\n:----|:----|:----\n\n\\*\\*CPU\\*\\* | \\[AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 4.7 GHz 8-Core Processor\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fPyH99/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-47-ghz-8-core-processor-100-1000001084wof) | $479.00 @ Abt \n\n\\*\\*CPU Cooler\\*\\* | \\[Phanteks Glacier One 360M25 G2 72.72 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/PzMXsY/phanteks-glacier-one-360m25-g2-7272-cfm-liquid-cpu-cooler-ph-go360m25g2\\_dwt02) |-\n\n\\*\\*Motherboard\\*\\* | \\[Gigabyte B850 AORUS ELITE WIFI7 ICE ATX AM5 Motherboard\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/VtJBD3/gigabyte-b850-aorus-elite-wifi7-ice-atx-am5-motherboard-b850-aorus-elite-wifi7-ice) |-\n\n\\*\\*Memory\\*\\* | \\[TEAMGROUP T-Create Expert 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QzP8TW/teamgroup-t-create-expert-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-ctcwd532g6000hc30dc01) |-\n\n\\*\\*Storage\\*\\* | \\[SK Hynix Platinum P41 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/yGTp99/sk-hynix-platinum-p41-2-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-shpp41-2000gm-2) |-\n\n\\*\\*Video Card\\*\\* | \\[PowerColor Hellhound Spectral Radeon RX 9070 XT 16 GB Video Card\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/2kJBD3/powercolor-hellhound-spectral-radeon-rx-9070-xt-16-gb-video-card-rx9070xt-16g-locwhite) |-\n\n\\*\\*Case\\*\\* | \\[Phanteks EVOLV X2 ATX Mid Tower Case\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/V4dMnQ/phanteks-evolv-x2-atx-mid-tower-case-ph-es524xtg\\_dmw01) |-\n\n\\*\\*Power Supply\\*\\* | \\[Corsair RM1000x (2024) 1000 W Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/XZsV3C/corsair-rm1000x-2024-1000-w-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-cp-9020271-na) |-\n\n\\*\\*Case Fan\\*\\* | \\[Phanteks M25G2-120 D-RGB Reverse 73.69 CFM 120 mm Fans 3-Pack\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/cq3WGX/phanteks-m25g2-120-d-rgb-reverse-7369-cfm-120-mm-fans-3-pack-ph-f120m25r\\_g2\\_dwt01-\\_3p) |-\n\n | \\*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts\\* |\n\n | \\*\\*Total\\*\\* | \\*\\*$479.00\\*\\*\n\n | Generated by \\[PCPartPicker\\](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-10-24 07:24 EDT-0400 |",

Based on my research, here’s the build I’ve put together: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Yy7GwY](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Yy7GwY) . My budget is around €1900. I mainly want to play single-player games at 1440p, though I occasionally play competitive games with friends (competitive play isn’t my main focus). Could you help me choose the best parts for the best prices? I don’t want to overspend on unnecessary high-end parts. For the GPU I’m considering the Radeon RX 9070XT but I can’t decide which model to get — XFX Mercury or Sapphire Pulse? The prices are very similar (XFX is slightly pricier). I’m also unsure which CPU cooler gives the best value. Thanks in advance for any advice!",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy beloved 2080 Ti failed the other night. I have used this card for a long time and it has served me incredibly well, but it is just not usable anymore I'm afraid. I have tried literally everything to repair it. Full cleaning inside and out, drivers reinstalled, full and clean reinstall of Windows 10, all components and connectors checked - And I'm still getting visual glitches and screens that blackout. I've even had a couple of blue screens while gaming. So I'm just not comfortable using the card anymore.\n\n  \nI am thinking about switching to AMD now, and I'd like some recs on how to proceed.\n\n  \nI am currently using a Ryzen 7 with a B450 Mobo and 32 Gb RAM. I have a Ryzen 9 on standby.\n\n  \nI used my 2080 Ti for gaming, streaming, and editing in 2k, and I'd like to continue to do that and upgrade if possible. I think I could spend around 500-800 on a new card.\n\n  \nLet me know what you think, and thank you!",

However, when I connect the front panel's cable to the motherboard, the computer boots slowly.\n\nAt first, I thought the problem might be the PSU, since it’s the only component that’s not a well-known brand (though it is gold-rated). But the system is stable after boot, so I don’t think the PSU is the issue. If the PSU were the problem, I would expect crashes, freezes, or unexpected reboots.\n\nI suspect the motherboard may not be handling power delivery correctly during boot, or it gets “confused” when multiple USB devices are connected to the front panel. I even tried disconnecting the front panel and using a USB hub instead, powered from the wall, connected to the rear ports and the problem persist\n\nIt seems the motherboard has trouble when additional USB devices are added during boot. If this were a PSU problem, I doubt I could run demanding tasks like LoRA training or use ComfyUI without crashing, since the GPU and CPU draw far more power than the front-panel USB ports, and I haven’t experienced any crashes.\n\nMy system specs:\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte Z890 Eagle\n\nPSU: Vetroo 1000W Black\n\nGPU: Zotac RTX 5090 Solid OC\n\nNVMe: WD Black 2TB SN8100\n\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 265K\n\nRAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR5 96GB\n",

    "selftext": "Hello, about a year ago one of my monitor broke, and my 3 monitors setup is down to 2 monitors. I use my Dell S2721DGF as main monitor but I want to upgrade to something similar but better, can anyone recommend me a better monitor but with similar aspects such as:\n\n\\- 27 inch, 2560x1440  \n\\- max 165 hz is enough, don't need more  \n\\- not curved  \n\\- not OLED (because of burn in, too expensive anyway)\n\nEdit:  \nForgot to mention, I primarily game in a well lit room and basically never game in a dark room. Don't care for fancy extra lightings on the back or side of the monitor as well. Looking for performance and color upgrade.",

When I assembled everything, the PC turned on, but I got stuck on an “AMI” screen, and pressing “DEL” got stuck on “Entering boot…”. I asked ChatGPT, and it told me to check the motherboard manual. After checking, I saw that it supports RAM at 4800/5200MHz, so I immediately returned the RAM. The only RAM available as soon as possible online is the CMK64GX5M2B5200C40, but the “C40” is for Intel.

    "selftext": "I’ve been getting into AI generation lately, mainly image and looking at video work along with running local ChatGPT-style models. The RTX 5060Ti 16GB looks like the most reasonably priced NVIDIA card that still offers a solid amount of VRAM.\n\n**Current setup:**  \n• RX 6600XT 8GB  \n• Ryzen 5 5600X  \n• 1080p 165Hz monitor\n\nI’m trying to figure out if the 5060Ti would actually be a smart upgrade or a potential headache.\n\n**Reasons I’m considering the 5060Ti:**  \n• 16GB VRAM, which is the most at it's price  \n• CUDA support  \n• Should work fine with my current power supply\n\n**Things against the 5060Ti:**  \n• There have been quite a few reports about driver problems and black screens on most 5000 series cards even with the latest drivers, and I’m not sure if those issues have been fixed yet  \n• AMD’s RX 9060XT is about $60 cheaper and also has 16GB of VRAM, but it doesn’t support CUDA\n\n**Other cards I’ve looked at:**  \n• RTX 3060 12GB, which feels like a downgrade even though it’s about $160 cheaper  \n• Used RTX 3090, which costs around $235 more than the 5060Ti  \n• RTX 5070, which is about $160 more and has less VRAM\n\nI don’t really play FPS or the latest high-end games. The most demanding one I play is BeamNG, so as long as it runs better than my 6600XT, that’s good enough for me.\n\n*My main question is whether the driver problems with the 5000 series have been fixed or if they’re still a big issue that could lead to a lot of frustration or possibly needing to return the card.*",

My main issue at the moment is I don't really know what cpu I should pair with my parts.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm working with a strict budget but a 7800x3D is out of the question lol. I mainly play games so I don't need anything super crazy. I've heard the ryzen 5 7600 is a good cpu for the price. I'm a little clueless as to what is actually good compared to what I've just heard on the internet. \n\nI don't even know if the parts I've already bought are even that good. I just got what I liked the look of and what I thought was reasonable. (I went overboard on my mobo but I went for the look more than anything. Same with my 3080 vision oc). \n\nHow much does ram matter? I will buy something ddr5 but what's even good? Should I splurge out on some corsair kit or could I save some and go for a crucial kit? How much does branding matter for ram and what's the difference between CL30, CL36 etc.?\n\nAny help at all would be greatly appreciated as I'm quite new to this. All my knowledge so far as been done through my own research so I'm not sure how good it is. \n\nThanks!",

I updated the graphics card & reseated the cables which temporarily helped. Today, I was opening Gmail when the computer again went black & now I cannot get it to boot. The CPU cooler lights up when powered on and I have what I believe are the DRAM and CPU red lights on the motherboard lit up, but nothing else powers up. I tried reseating the RAM again but the error did not clear. I looked up some old Reddit posts but I am going to be honest I need someone to ELI5 because those tutorials were all Greek to me.\n\nAlso open to suggestions of some reputable places to take the PC to get looked at if this feels like something I probably cannot figure out myself.",

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case. \n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well. \n\n\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**",

    "selftext": "I’ve put together an [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3TF2DPQ120GPQ?ref_=wl_share) for my build (parts listed below). I’m not looking for much criticism on the overall build unless it’s genuinely valuable input—I mainly have a few questions and   \nclarifications.\n\n1. I originally picked the **RTX 5070 Ti**, but since this [MSI RTX 5080](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Graphics-DisplayPort-Blackwell-Architecture/dp/B0DSX9Y24P?crid=1ANQJB2GHJ97T&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UHZUIztdnvxcNlqPrrOJ-OFU0y3H9_NbAJezorgSJ-OohPamWGhuP_rrzK2ORg0aow4bHnSWyHx2LUkO-kXqjwvNU0zZ9Hp-ZpEQbvDIsB7WUh6XKfssCxweM06tA_uPHWMH5ngtAw4fuOrgMkqJ2xknaMNuJoyR3i7rR2c3l2PSDwrjsR0IMfYIoQJam3e44UTHYLPg2gNnapq9iGFY1phVpbVcd_FYlg_5OZv7TmZlQbC5YHDfrjmMXtpC0Vspj6MgnUcEp71Sjs-ETzTxnuH8IjTJGgvmdg4rlnBlUtM.AWNXtmGP6y1hCp2xAo62DLTicQF32385dirJkeVanuw&dib_tag=se&keywords=5080+nvidia&qid=1761309812&s=electronics&sprefix=5080+nv%2Celectronics%2C4077&sr=1-24) is only \\~$200 more, I’m wondering why it’s priced so low. It’s MSI-branded, looks great, and seems solid—so is there a catch? Does it underperform, or is it just a good deal?\n2. I know the **motherboard** (MSI MPG X870E Carbon WiFi) is kind of overkill, but I love the extra 10G USB ports—I always run out—and it’s one of the best-looking boards next to the Hatsune Miku one (lol). Should I stick with it for future-proofing, or can I safely downgrade to something cheaper without losing much?\n3. My **case** (Lian Li O11 Vision) doesn’t include fans. I’d like to keep the branding consistent for RGB syncing, so I was planning on using **Lian Li Infinity fans**. Are they good enough performance-wise, or should I look at something else?\n4. I’m set on the **TRYX Panorama 360 AIO**—can I easily swap out its fans for Lian Li ones (or another brand)? Will I need multiple controllers for all the fans, or is syncing everything through one ecosystem manageable both hardware- and software-wise?\n5. Lastly, with the glass-top setup, I only have room for a 360mm AIO on near the front, another 360mm on the bottom, and a 240mm radiator in the back. Any input on fan placement or airflow for that layout?\n\nSorry if these are basic questions—I’ve done plenty of research, but I still want to be sure before pulling the trigger.  \n  \nBuild List:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* MSI Gaming RTX 5070 Ti 16G MLG Edition OC (considering RTX 5080)\n* MSI MPG X870E Carbon WiFi Motherboard\n* Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 32GB (2x16GB) 6400MHz\n* Samsung 990 Pro 2TB SSD\n* MSI MPG A1250GS PCIe5 Fully Modular 1250W PSU\n* TRYX Panorama 360 ARGB 360mm AIO (6.67\" AMOLED Curved Screen)\n* Lian Li O11 Vision (three-sided tempered glass, dual-chamber ATX mid tower)\n\n",

I tried to keep it as budget-friendly as possible while still being powerful enough for 1440p and even some 4K gaming.\n\nSpecs:\n\nCPU: Ryzen 5 5600X — £75 used (with new Wraith cooler)\n\nMotherboard: MSI B550M PRO-VDH WiFi — £56 refurbished\n\nRAM: 16GB (2×8GB) Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 3200MHz — £16 used\n\nGPU: ASRock RX 6800 XT (reference) — £286 used\n\nStorage: Lexar Gen 4 NVMe 1TB — £48 new\n\nPSU: Gigabyte P650SS 650W — £44 new\n\nCase: MSI MAG 100R PZ — £75 new (probably could have gone for a cheaper case to stay below £600)\n\n\nTotal: £600\n\nInitially won an eBay auction for an RX 6750 XT at £180, but the seller cancelled on me. I couldn’t find another one around that price, so I decided to spend a little more and get the RX 6800 XT instead.\n\nWhat do you think of the value and parts balance? Could I have done better, or are there any parts you’d swap for better value?",

    "selftext": "I consider buying a 4TB SSD to extend the storage of my MacBook. Now both the WD Black SN7100 and SN850X, as well as Samsung 990 Plus/Pro are on sale. From my understanding the difference within each brand is DRAM vs. DRAMless. \n\nThe drive should primarily serve to store photos and videos (4k) that I want to edit directly on. I want to encrypt the drive with VeraCrypt, if that matters for the choice.\n\nSo some considerations I have:\n1. It's in an external enclosure, will DRAM even be used? Is there a noticeable difference in real life, especially for example when scrolling/searching through footages very fast in DaVinci Resolve. \n2. Longevity is important, as it should also serve as a backup drive. Does DRAM make a difference? Any brand/model that is especially durable? \n3. If DRAM is irrelevant, the DRAMless SSDs seem to have better thermals. Will this improve longevity or performance? Especially since it will be inside an enclosure without optimal air flow. \n4. The price difference is about 10%, which I think is neglectible, better buy once instead of regretting.\n\nAnything else to consider? \nThanks you all! ",

My main issue at the moment is I don't really know what cpu I should pair with my parts.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm working with a strict budget but a 7800x3D is out of the question lol. I mainly play games so I don't need anything super crazy. I've heard the ryzen 5 7600 is a good cpu for the price. I'm a little clueless as to what is actually good compared to what I've just heard on the internet. \n\nI don't even know if the parts I've already bought are even that good. I just got what I liked the look of and what I thought was reasonable. (I went overboard on my mobo but I went for the look more than anything. Same with my 3080 vision oc). \n\nHow much does ram matter? I will buy something ddr5 but what's even good? Should I splurge out on some corsair kit or could I save some and go for a crucial kit? How much does branding matter for ram and what's the difference between CL30, CL36 etc.?\n\nAny help at all would be greatly appreciated as I'm quite new to this. All my knowledge so far as been done through my own research so I'm not sure how good it is. \n\nThanks!",

The CPU cooler lights up when powered on and I have what I believe are the DRAM and CPU red lights on the motherboard lit up, but nothing else powers up.

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case. \n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well. \n\n\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone.

However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me.

It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

    "selftext": "\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hoh56t949twf1.gif\n\nHey, I’m Sulo (SuloSounds) and I’m a solo developer from Finland and my game Remote Position is finally here!\n\nRemote Position is a single player game that offers a deep mysterious story with a lot of secrets\n\nI designed some of the secrets to last a lifetime hopefully. You can prove me wrong 😀\n\nGameplay consists of simple first person point-and-click mechanics. Where it stands out is interactivity. Environment is carefully hand-crafted with attention to detail, from the architecture of the buildings all the way down to the flushing sounds in the toilet.\n\nThe estimated length of the game is roughly 2 hours i would say. The length of the game depends on how fast you solve the puzzles. Some of them might be slightly on the more difficult side of the spectrum since they are a little bit unconventional.\n\n**Main features**\n\n* **Atmospheric first-person** mystery with light point-and-click style interactions.  \n* **Highly interactive environments** \\- almost everything reacts: drawers, switches, computers, instruments, sauna, etc.  \n* **Environmental storytelling**: newspapers, phones, and tiny props that hide clues.  \n* **Puzzles** that skew a bit **unconventional** \\- some are simple, a few are “huh… wait” moments by design.  \n\nBuilt to reward **curiosity** and **note-taking** rather than brute forcing.",

    "selftext": "To be more specific, Massive Entertainment put out a social media statement implying that they're encouraging staff to voluntarily leave the company/lay themselves off with benefits/company assistance:\n\n\"As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games. To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone! The VR edition has now officially launched on Steam and I’m super excited - it’s my first VR title! Developing for VR has definitely been a different experience compared to normal game development .. challenging at times if I have to be honest.   \n  \nI’ve learned a lot along the way and willing to learn more especially with the help and feedback from the community! In this game you have to get to your objectives by blowing your trench whistle but the catch is the enemies can hear your whistle too, footsteps on wooden floor (if they squeek), dropping bottles or hitting them, etc. Thanks for checking it out!

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

    "selftext": "Windows 11 has the Win+Alt+B keyboard shortcut for toggling HDR mode, which I only recently found out. But I also discovered a bug ever since updgrading Win11 from 23H2 to 24H2, which still exists in 25H2, for that matter. I have monitor calibration hardware, and so my monitors are calibrated and have their own ICC display profile files that need to be active. Previous to 24H2, when you toggled HDR mode Windows would automatically load your display profile file and apply its settings so your display looked right. And when you switched back to SDR your SDR ICC profile would be applied again. For some reason, this is broken in Win11 24H2 and after. When you toggle between SDR/HDR the appropriate display profile file is not activated. This is pretty annoying if you actually have a custom calibrated display profile.\n\nI soon discovered that simply opening Display Settings without actually doing anything in there would apply the profile, and colours/brightness would be correct again. I got sick of doing this manually every time I jumped between SDR and HDR for gaming or to watch a movie. So I wrote a small util called toggleHDR which will toggle between SDR/HDR and briefly open and close Dispaly Settings to get the proper profile activated. This will also give Windows 10 users the same toggling ability.\n\n**Usage:** Just create a shortcut to toggleHDR.exe, and perhaps pin it to your taskbar or start menu for quick access. If you are still on 23H2 and don't need to have Display Settings open then you can add a command line switch:\n\ntoggleHDR.exe --no-icc\n\nand that will toggle modes without opening Display Settings. You may also want that under Win10, since I don't think the display profile bug exists there, though I haven't checked. That it hasn't annoyed me there probably means it works fine.",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Leandro Felippe de Paiva Gomes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10798/leandro-felippe-de-paiva-gomes) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-ps5/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case.\n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well.\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyg150a4p2xf1.jpg?width=1212&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de264762270719d2c4902452974c4af60507a8b4\n\n  \n",

Here's what to buy instead:\n\n**Mice:**\n\n**DON'T buy:** $80 \"gaming mouse\" with 47 buttons and RGB that cycles through every color\n\n**DO buy:** Simple optical mouse with good sensor, \\~80g weight, quality switches\n\nWhat actually matters:\n\n* Sensor (3360, 3389, or modern equivalents)\n* Weight (lighter is usually better for FPS)\n* Shape that fits your hand\n* Build quality\n\nLogitech G Pro, Razer Viper Mini, Glorious Model O - all solid, all under $50.\n\n**Keyboards:**\n\n**DON'T buy:** $150 \"gaming keyboard\" with membrane switches and flashy lights\n\n**DO buy:** Mechanical keyboard from a reputable brand\n\nWhat actually matters:\n\n* Actual mechanical switches (Cherry MX, Gateron, Kailh)\n* Build quality (metal backplate, not plastic)\n* Layout you like (TKL, 60%, full-size)\n* RGB is optional (and doesn't affect performance)\n\nKeychron, Royal Kludge, even Redragon make solid boards for $50-80.\n\n**Headsets:**\n\n**DON'T buy:** \"7.1 surround sound gaming headset\" for $120\n\n**DO buy:** Good stereo headphones + separate mic\n\nWhat actually matters:\n\n* Stereo sound quality beats fake surround every time\n* Comfort for long sessions\n* Decent mic (or buy separate)\n\nAudio-Technica M40x ($80) + cheap USB mic ($20) destroys any \"gaming headset\" under $150.\n\nOr: Philips SHP9500 + V-Moda BoomPro = $80 total, better than most $150 headsets.\n\n**Chairs:**\n\n**DON'T buy:** $400 \"racing-style gaming chair\"\n\n**DO buy:** Used office chair from a reputable brand\n\nWhat actually matters:\n\n* Lumbar support (actually adjustable, not a pillow)\n* Seat depth adjustment\n* Armrest adjustment\n* Breathable material\n\nUsed Herman Miller Aeron on Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace: $300-400 Used Steelcase Leap: $250-350\n\nThese chairs were designed for 8+ hour office use. Racing chairs were designed to LOOK cool, not to BE comfortable.\n\n**Monitors:**\n\n**DON'T buy:** \"Gaming monitor\" with 1ms response time claim but terrible colors\n\n**DO buy:** Good IPS panel with actual 144Hz+ refresh rate\n\nWhat actually matters:\n\n* Actual refresh rate (240Hz minimum for competitive gaming)\n* Response time (but measured honestly, not marketing BS)\n* Panel type (IPS for colors, TN for cheapest high refresh)\n* FreeSync/G-Sync compatibility\n\nLG, Samsung, Dell make great gaming monitors without the \"gamer\" aesthetic markup.\n\n**What IS worth the premium:**\n\n* **Mouse pads (extended):** $15-25 for a nice extended desk mat is worth it\n* **Monitor arms:** $30-50 for desk space and ergonomics\n* **Cable management:** $10 in velcro straps makes your setup look pro\n\n**The mindset shift:**\n\nAsk yourself: \"Does this feature improve my performance or comfort?\"\n\n* RGB lighting? No.\n* Angular aggressive design? No.\n* Actual mechanical switches? Yes.\n* Adjustable ergonomics? Yes.\n* High refresh rate? Yes.\n* \"Pro gamer endorsed\"? Absolutely not.\n\n**My current setup (total: \\~$400):**\n\n* Mouse: Logitech G305 - $40\n* Keyboard: Royal Kludge RK61 - $45\n* Headphones: Philips SHP9500 + BoomPro - $80\n* Mousepad: Large desk mat - $20\n* Chair: Used Steelcase Leap - $300 (Craigslist)\n\nThis beats my old $800 \"all gaming gear\" setup in every single way.\n\n**The exception:**\n\nIf you genuinely LOVE RGB and flashy designs, go for it. But don't convince yourself you're paying for \"performance.\" You're paying for aesthetics, and that's okay if you know what you're buying.\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\nThe gaming peripheral market preys on people who don't know what actually matters. Now you do.\n\nWhat \"gaming\" gear did you replace with better non-gaming alternatives? Share your wins.",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Replacing Gtx1080ti\nNeed: More than 30FPS on 32\" QHD monitor. Want: Longevity, Future-proofing\nHave: Recently Upgraded PC - MB, CPU, RAM. Budget: 650USD (flexible)\nQueries: AMD/Nvidia? 2nd-Hand/New/Brand New?\n\nLooking for some advice on upgrading my old and tired GTX 1080 Ti 11GB. I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

Change bios from RAID, because fuck intel rapid storage, or the vendor has some special controller drivers that don't work on W11 22h2 only 24h2, and the default windows drivers don't function.  I get errors, issues, and all sorts of headache now with modern machines. \n\nMany won't boot though NVME despite it all, and yet works just fine over a usb connection, so you might say \" oh, you just gotta make sure boot type is set right in bios and the right driver is in\" \n\nIT IS!!!!!!!!  I have not found out exactly what it is yet, and I just don't have the time at work to do it this way ( it's not how they want us to do it) but I want the customer to get the best result, but it's getting difficult to fix.. \n\nAny custom machine, and it would just work- the default windows NVME controller driver works just fine, but apparently things have to be extra special. \n\n\nIf you read this all, then thanks- maybe I'm just missing something, but I wanted to vent my frustration, no matter how dumb it may or may not be.\n\nEdit:  None of these issues ever appeared till companies started moving towards NVME / M.2 systems.  I never had any problem at all with SATA.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve got a PC that I built around 5 years ago, mainly for gaming but also for some casual web browsing and photo editing. It’s been solid overall, but lately I’ve noticed that my photo editing workflow feels sluggish, especially in Lightroom Classic.\n\nHere are my current specs:\n\n* Ryzen 5 5600X\n* ASUS TUF RTX 3070\n* 32GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM\n\nGaming-wise, I’m fine — I don’t play as many AAA titles anymore, and when I do (like Battlefield), I get around 80–90 FPS, which is decent for me. My main issue is with editing performance. In Lightroom Classic, moving between images can sometimes take a couple of seconds to load, and basic adjustments occasionally lag. It really breaks the flow when I’m trying to go through a big batch of photos.\n\nI mostly use:\n\n* **Lightroom Classic** (main)\n* **Photoshop**\n* **Luminar Neo** (occasionally)\n* **DaVinci Resolve** (rarely)\n\nI know GPUs help with AI-based tools and certain effects, but I’m trying to figure out if upgrading to a much better CPU (like one of the new Ryzen X3D models) plus a stronger GPU (like a 5070 Ti or 5080), along with DDR5 RAM, would noticeably improve performance in Lightroom/Photoshop — or if what I’m experiencing is mostly a software limitation that won’t change much even with top-tier hardware.\n\nBasically:\n\n* Will a high-end upgrade make Lightroom feel significantly smoother (instant image switching, faster brush and masking tools, etc.)?\n* Or is this just how Lightroom is, no matter what hardware you throw at it?\n* And should I even consider switching to a Mac if optimization is the main issue?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s upgraded recently or switched platforms and can share what actually made a difference.",

No overclocking, no upscaling... just heat in the form of wasted electrons. Three games, three resolutions, three rounds. Winner takes nothing.\n\nThe 5050 came out swinging in the first round at 1080p, winning two out of three games. Round 2 at 1440p saw the 4080 take some control back but ended in a draw. Round 3 at 4 K had the 6700K pinned at 90 percent usage but still managed to give the 4080 Super enough rope to completely KO the 5050 and send it crying back to its corner.\n\nNo, there was no point to this.\n\nYes, it was fun.\n\nThe video’s here if you want to see the stupidity unfold.

Holes didnt allign pretty well, the cable management options were limited and you have to cram your parts into the desk sometimes. \n\nI will probably build a new PC in 2026 (considering to wait for a new generation of videocards and processors). I am also considering swapping my desk for a tower or a new desk. \n\nIs anyone of you familiar with the dk07 and how it compared to the dk05 in terms of quality?",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Replacing Gtx1080ti\nNeed: More than 30FPS on 32\" QHD monitor. Want: Longevity, Future-proofing\nHave: Recently Upgraded PC - MB, CPU, RAM. Budget: 650USD (flexible)\nQueries: AMD/Nvidia? 2nd-Hand/New/Brand New?\n\nLooking for some advice on upgrading my old and tired GTX 1080 Ti 11GB. I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

No overclocking, no upscaling... just heat in the form of wasted electrons. Three games, three resolutions, three rounds.

You can only imagine how much an 80 year old would hate having to do anything more than the minimum when it comes to technology. \n\nWith software, I can migrate their data, like pictures, files, etc but it's not 100%- things like printers, programs, configurations, etc all don't move well even with decent software that's suppose to migrate you from one PC to another. \n\nI instead, will clone their old PC to a temp SSD, upgrade it to W11, update / install all those FUCKING vendor specific drivers and then attempt to boot into it. \n\nIt use to work flawlessly- but now we got these god forsaken new PC''s coming with drivers, bios versions, and hardware that only work properly on certain windows versions, and must all be configured perfectly with each other.  Change bios from RAID, because fuck intel rapid storage, or the vendor has some special controller drivers that don't work on W11 22h2 only 24h2, and the default windows drivers don't function.  I get errors, issues, and all sorts of headache now with modern machines. \n\nMany won't boot though NVME despite it all, and yet works just fine over a usb connection, so you might say \" oh, you just gotta make sure boot type is set right in bios and the right driver is in\" \n\nIT IS!!!!!!!!  I have not found out exactly what it is yet, and I just don't have the time at work to do it this way ( it's not how they want us to do it) but I want the customer to get the best result, but it's getting difficult to fix.. \n\nAny custom machine, and it would just work- the default windows NVME controller driver works just fine, but apparently things have to be extra special. \n\n\nIf you read this all, then thanks- maybe I'm just missing something, but I wanted to vent my frustration, no matter how dumb it may or may not be.\n\nEdit:  None of these issues ever appeared till companies started moving towards NVME / M.2 systems.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve got a PC that I built around 5 years ago, mainly for gaming but also for some casual web browsing and photo editing. It’s been solid overall, but lately I’ve noticed that my photo editing workflow feels sluggish, especially in Lightroom Classic.\n\nHere are my current specs:\n\n* Ryzen 5 5600X\n* ASUS TUF RTX 3070\n* 32GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM\n\nGaming-wise, I’m fine — I don’t play as many AAA titles anymore, and when I do (like Battlefield), I get around 80–90 FPS, which is decent for me. My main issue is with editing performance. In Lightroom Classic, moving between images can sometimes take a couple of seconds to load, and basic adjustments occasionally lag. It really breaks the flow when I’m trying to go through a big batch of photos.\n\nI mostly use:\n\n* **Lightroom Classic** (main)\n* **Photoshop**\n* **Luminar Neo** (occasionally)\n* **DaVinci Resolve** (rarely)\n\nI know GPUs help with AI-based tools and certain effects, but I’m trying to figure out if upgrading to a much better CPU (like one of the new Ryzen X3D models) plus a stronger GPU (like a 5070 Ti or 5080), along with DDR5 RAM, would noticeably improve performance in Lightroom/Photoshop — or if what I’m experiencing is mostly a software limitation that won’t change much even with top-tier hardware.\n\nBasically:\n\n* Will a high-end upgrade make Lightroom feel significantly smoother (instant image switching, faster brush and masking tools, etc.)?\n* Or is this just how Lightroom is, no matter what hardware you throw at it?\n* And should I even consider switching to a Mac if optimization is the main issue?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s upgraded recently or switched platforms and can share what actually made a difference.",

However, my screen (Samsung OLED G9) started to act up since yesterday.\n\nThe first issue were white-ish squares on my screen,**this was on my work laptop**, which was connected via a USB-C Thunderbolt cable to my laptop. \n\nToday, my entire screen starting to act up like seen in the video.**This is connected via a proper quality HDMI 2.1 cable to my main, personal, PC.**\n\nAt first, I was worried my new GPU was fried, but the issue cames back in a different way on my work laptop.\n\nI've tried reseating every cable on every point and changing cables to older cables (which worked fine in the past but were a bit too small to tidy up the desk).\n\nThe screen should have plenty of space to dissipate the heat. **My other monitor above it, a Samsung OLED G8, which is connected in the same way to my laptop (Thunderbolt 4) and personal PC (DisplayPort) has no issues what so ever when in use.**\n\nAny help with this would be much appreciated! \n\nPC Specs:\n- R9 9950X3D\n- RTX 5090\n- 32GB RAM\n- Asus STRIX X870E-E motherboard\n\nLaptop: HP Elitebook 850 G8",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Replacing Gtx1080ti\nNeed: More than 30FPS on 32\" QHD monitor. Want: Longevity, Future-proofing\nHave: Recently Upgraded PC - MB, CPU, RAM. Budget: 650USD (flexible)\nQueries: AMD/Nvidia? 2nd-Hand/New/Brand New?\n\nLooking for some advice on upgrading my old and tired GTX 1080 Ti 11GB. I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

In the heart of this eerie silence, a strange house suddenly glows with warm orange light pouring from its windows, while the grinning pumpkin at the gate seems to whisper, beckoning lost souls to draw closer.\n\nThat’s Night of Howls Cherry Art’s special Halloween keycap, crafted to celebrate this year’s spooky season.\n\nEvery detail is meticulously recreated: the swirling purple sky, gnarled tree branches, the haunted house, and the glowing jack o' lantern all blending to create an atmosphere that’s both chilling and captivating.\n\n💡 Special Lighting Effects:\n\nUnder normal light, the keycap appears as a classic Halloween painting in mystical purple and orange tones dark, moody, and irresistibly alluring.\n\nUnder UV light, magic unfolds: the house blazes to life, windows ignite like flames burn within, and the pumpkin’s grin glows with ghostly delight as if the spirit of Halloween has just awakened from a long slumber.\n\nAfter UV light fades, the keycap returns to stillness: the haunted house sinks into deep shadow, yet the windows still burn bright, inviting you to step inside. The night sky stirs with faint, ethereal glows like restless souls rising to drift across the midnight heavens.\n\nThank you all so much for always supporting and standing by the team!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n● Link Raffle [https://zfrmz.com/tOT8niK8WuocbdyfXGhl](https://zfrmz.com/tOT8niK8WuocbdyfXGhl)\n\n● Link Image [https://photos.app.goo.gl/hhNATc2yNgq4yNMK7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hhNATc2yNgq4yNMK7)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nArtisan Keycap Detail\n\n● Sculpt: Blank Art\n\n● Name: Night of Howls\n\n● Price for sale: $100/1 Keycap \n\n● Quantity: 5 Keycaps/ Colorway\n\n● Stem type: Cherry MX\n\n● All keycaps are cast multi layer colors resin 100%\n\n● The set includes: 1 box, 1 user manual, 1 ID card and 1 Night of Howls Keycap. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nRaffle info\n\n● Raffle will be opened within 12 hours and when Raffle closes, the winner will receive an invoice via mail within 1 hours and will have 24 hours to pay \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFollow Craftkey as:\n\nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/craftkey/](https://www.instagram.com/craftkey/)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/Craftkeycap](https://www.facebook.com/Craftkeycap)\n\nWebsite: [https://www.craftkeyartisan.com/](https://www.craftkeyartisan.com/)\n\nDiscor: [https://discord.gg/k9B7eTV4HS](https://discord.gg/k9B7eTV4HS)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I am currently rearranging my desk and I wanted to share my three keyboards! All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/osqvzf04zpwf1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934d86fd6b2611ac9c1986eb8209ea86c09bf7b4\n\nA quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

The firmware is pretty meh IMO, so I would like to investigate if I can reflash it to QMK or something.\n\nAnyways, around the same time, I stumbled on these switches: [https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches](https://divinikey.com/products/aeboards-raeds-he-switches)\n\nAnd I realized this is the perfect recipe for me to try out something like a topre experience without the up front cost of the Topre boards I have seen that appeal to me. So I swapped them in, and so far have been pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. I can definitely see where folks are coming from with Topre being a unique take on tactile feel.\n\nI also slapped on some PBT keycaps I found, \"Dark Covenant\" is the name of the design. And at some point I have a Behelit artisan key from Etsy coming. All and all a fun, unique, and cheap build.\n\nThought the cheap HE keyboard combined with topre-like switches might give some folks ideas/interest in experimenting, so here I am posting it.",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

In the heart of this eerie silence, a strange house suddenly glows with warm orange light pouring from its windows, while the grinning pumpkin at the gate seems to whisper, beckoning lost souls to draw closer.\n\nThat’s Night of Howls Cherry Art’s special Halloween keycap, crafted to celebrate this year’s spooky season.\n\nEvery detail is meticulously recreated: the swirling purple sky, gnarled tree branches, the haunted house, and the glowing jack o' lantern all blending to create an atmosphere that’s both chilling and captivating.\n\n💡 Special Lighting Effects:\n\nUnder normal light, the keycap appears as a classic Halloween painting in mystical purple and orange tones dark, moody, and irresistibly alluring.\n\nUnder UV light, magic unfolds: the house blazes to life, windows ignite like flames burn within, and the pumpkin’s grin glows with ghostly delight as if the spirit of Halloween has just awakened from a long slumber.\n\nAfter UV light fades, the keycap returns to stillness: the haunted house sinks into deep shadow, yet the windows still burn bright, inviting you to step inside.

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

It is now late October, and my order status is still \"Unfulfilled.\"\n\nTo follow up, I sent an email to their customer support on **October 15th** to cancel the order and request a full refund, but I have received no reply.\n\nI also sent them a message on Instagram on **October 19th**. The account has been \"online\" multiple times since I sent it, but they are deliberately ignoring my message.\n\nI recently sent an email to their customer support to cancel the order and request a full refund, but I have received no reply.\n\nAfter getting no response, I did a search and found this thread, which seems to confirm the worst: [Geistmaschine appears to be defunct/exit scamming](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1mq742g/geistmaschine_appears_to_be_defunctexit_scamming/)\n\nAt this point, I'm assuming the company is gone and has taken the money. Has anyone else had a similar experience with them recently?",

Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "title": "ASUS ROG XG27AQDPG (500Hz 1440p QD-OLED) Written Review",
    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

(Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

I have a rtx 3070ti laptop 8gb vram 16gm ram. I do not think that my laptop will be powerful to run many games at 4k even with dlss. \n\nMy options are either run games on a 1440p monitor(laptop screen is 1440p doable with dlss) or 1080p on 4k monitor in demanding games. \n\nI would love to have a good screen for media consumption. \nAny help is much appreciated. Thank you.",

    "selftext": "This is a 32\" Samsung Odyssey Neo G7, but I don't know if the display cracked during shipping by the courier, or if the display cracked during unpacking and assembly. It's a shame, they are more fragile than regular glass.\n\nI filed a complaint the day I received the package, within about two hours. I immediately wrote to the complaints department and the next day they called me with an apology and information that they would send a courier.\n\nThe courier arrived about a week later and took the package away. After four days, the complaint was acknowledged and the money was returned to my account.\n\nSo overall, I didn't lose anything, and I must say that the process was quick and without complications. Such things should be dealt with immediately, not waiting and then regretting it.\n\nThis was my first experience with a complaint and it turned out surprisingly well. I was quite shocked and anxious when I saw the cracked display.",

I don't like looking at the judder of a 25p panning shot on a 60 Hz monitor and love having no judder when playing 24p at a refresh rate that is a multiple of 24.\n\n**Time to modernise**\n\nI have been upgrading my tech recently (no more Haswell-based system as I've build an AM5-based PC) and I am preparing to get into UHD gaming (likely with the help of FSR upscaling with the RX 9070 XT I have ordered). I have a few questions as I have never owned a high refresh monitor or one with a variable refresh rate (well, besides my new laptop with a range or 40 - 60 Hz VRR).\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. I'm looking at a 4K gaming monitor (LG 27GR93U) as the main monitor but I imagine these questions and answers apply to many models of monitors - it is a 144 Hz panel with VRR (48 - 144 Hz). I would like to default my Windows desktop to 120 Hz for ease of watching 24p, 30p and 60p content judder-free by default. Can I set the desktop resolution VRR range to be 48 - 120 Hz out of the box? \\*Judder-free video playback is more important to me than seeing more than 120 fps in video games. If this isn't commonly available, I might default to VRR off unless I'm gaming.\n2. When I want to watch 25p or 50p video content I'd like to manually set the screen to a 50 Hz (2\\*25, 1\\*50) or 100 Hz refresh rate (not 75 Hz as that's only good for 25p playback at 3\\*25, not 50p at 1.5\\*50). The manual to nearly every high refresh rate monitor I've looked at do not list 50 Hz and 100 Hz unless it is specifically a 100 Hz 1080p monitor. **May I kindly ask if some of you reading could check if your modern high refresh rate monitors have 50 Hz and 100 Hz options available within your Windows or GPU driver settings?** I would really appreciate it.\n3. I'm looking at getting a 1080p monitor as a second screen - one with HDCP 2.2 compliance like the LG 27GR93U has (looking at the Dell SE2425HG 1080p 200 Hz monitor). I have already seen that it supports 120 Hz so that is good for switching between 200 Hz when watching 25p (8\\*25) and 50p (4\\*50) content and 120 Hz for 24p (5\\*24), 30p (4\\*30) and 60p (2\\*60). **I've seen other 1080p monitors with weird refresh rates like 165 Hz** (bad for all video playback) **and 180 Hz** (only good for 30p and 60p playback). **If you have a monitor with these refresh rates, do you also have 120 Hz, 100 Hz and 50 Hz options? I'd love to know.**\n\n\\*Note: by judder-free I do not mean motion interpolation also known as TruMotion (LG), MotionFlow (Sony), Picture Clarity or Auto Motion Plus (Samsung) etc. I detest motion interpolation.\n\n**Final notes**\n\nI don't see too many people ask these questions online on other forums through Google searching and those who do rarely got good or knowledgeable answers. Many dismiss the OP's concerns, thinking that the higher the refresh rate, the better no matter what it is. Some have no idea about how mis-matching video content with framerate causes judder. 3:2 pulldown should be a term everyone knows but apparently not. If you have a look at your refresh rate options in your high refresh rate UHD monitor settings I'd be very grateful and more confident in what I buy. \n\nI encourage responses from as many people with as many different monitor models as available.\n\nWith Quick Media Switching limited to full screen video signals on UHD TVs (QMS), I hope that for PC monitors we'll see 2160p 600 Hz monitors one day (600 is the lowest common multiple for 24, 25, 30, 50 and 60). I don't care enough about 48p films to wish for a native 2160p 1200 Hz monitor.\n\nThank you.",

This will be my daily driver, but my main focus is gaming. I mostly play single-player games, though I do jump into multiplayer occasionally, but nothing competitive.\n\nI’m upgrading from a dual 27\" setup, so either choice would be a pretty noticeable change. My PC has a 4080 Super paired with a 7800X3D, so running 4K isn’t a problem. What I’m trying to figure out is whether I’d get more immersive experiences from the extra width of a 34\" ultrawide or the extra height of a 32\" 4K.\n\nIf anyone has experience with both or has a similar setup, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

    "title": "My monitors randomly turn black for a second then return to normal",
    "selftext": "About a week ago, shortly after a Windows update, my computer monitors began to randomly turn black for about a second then return to normal. The computer remains running and all the monitors system lights remain lit. I have three monitors and a TV attached to my custom built PC. An AOC G2 CQ32G2S, an AOC 24B2W1 (List says AOC 24B2XH because I couldn't find the 24B2W1 on PCPartPicker), an ARZOPA 16.1'' 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor, and a 42\" VIZIO TV. PCPartPicker list bellow.\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/P3gBkf](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/P3gBkf)\n\nI used this set up for about a week before the issue began. The AOC 24B2W1 is the newest addition to my set up and I added about two weeks ago. I can not find a pattern in when monitors turn black or in which ones turn black. Some times only one monitor will go black, some times two, some times all three. Which one is always different though it occurs more frequently with the two AOC monitors then the Arzopa. The TV has yet to have the issue. I also cannot find any pattern in the length of time between the issue occurring. Some times it occurs shortly after I turn my PC on then there isn't an issue for the rest of the day. Some times it occurs once after hours of use. Some times it occurs multiple times through out the day. \n\nAll the monitors are plugged into my uninterruptable power supply while the TV is plugged into a surge protector. The uninterruptable power supply and surge protector are plugged into different outlets. I have used all the cables before and have never had issues with any of them. \n\nThe issue occurs whether or not the TV is on. It has occurred while I was gaming, while I was watching YouTube, while I was drawing, and even when my PC was sitting ideal.\n\nI tried setting all my monitors and the TV to 1920 x 1080 at 60 Hz, but the issue continued.\n\nAlso occasionally the monitors will show static instead of black when the issue occurs.\n\nAny ideas on what could be causing this and how I can fix it?",

    "selftext": "Laptop: M4 Pro Macbook Pro (Sequoia)  \nMonitor 1: ASUS PB287Q  \nMonitor 2: KTC H27P22S\n\nI have this issue where I'm connecting the ASUS and the KTC monitors through a dock (Amazon's TB4) and\n\n(1) if I either connect the KTC first or both of them simultaneously through the Dock, the ASUS isn't recognized,  \n(2) only if I connect the ASUS first, or if I connect both of them but unplug and plug again the KTC, the ASUS is recognized.\n\nImportant details:\n\n* This is port agnostic. Connecting the KTC through either HDMI or DP-USB-c leads to the same effect.\n* It's not about the DP-USB-C cable on the ASUS. I've tested swapping the DP-USB-C cables and the result was the same.\n* It's not about the Dock. The effect is the same on the TB4 dock or using the computer's dedicated ports.\n* None of this is an issue on my other Macbook, an M1 Max (Ventura).\n\nMy current intuition is that somehow the KTC is \"faster\" at doing the handshake regardless of the protocol, and my M4 Pro somehow is shutting the recognition window for the slower monitor. And somehow this is an issue for Pro video cards and not for Max ones, regardless of age. Or maybe it's a Sequoia bug?\n\nIs there a way to fix this? Is the culprit the old ASUS monitor?\n\nChatGPT suggests I use an EDID emulator to delay the HPD of the KTC monitor. Does that make sense?",

I’ve seen a few high-end flat models (like the ASUS ROG Swift PG32UCDM and LG UltraGear 32GS95UE), and some curved OLEDs that are only 1440p or ultrawide, but not full 4K *and* curved *and* 240Hz.\n\nSo far, the only one that might fit all three specs is the **Gigabyte FO32U2P**, but I’m not sure if it’s actually curved or if that’s just marketing. Alienware’s 32\" 4K 240Hz QD-OLED also pops up in searches, but details on curvature are mixed. I need it mostly for Films, I might be willing to settle for a non curved if I cant find it but the black colour is also a big issue.\n\nHas anyone seen a *confirmed* curved black 4K OLED 240Hz model that’s actually released (not just announced)?  \nOr is it still something that’ll roll out next year?\n\nThanks in advance, I’d appreciate any real user experience or confirmed info!",

Loved it.\nThen I removed the protective film, crumpled it up, and tossed it in the trash.\n\nWhen I looked at my monitor again, I had the horrible realization: the panel wasn't reflective anymore. It never was. The thing that made it \"reflective\" was, in reality, the protective film.\n\nAh... The universe truly works in very funny ways sometimes.\n\nNow, my question is: is there any product to make this achievable again? And if so, what keywords should I use? I've looked up \"24 inch screen protector\" but all I find is anti-glare/matte ones.\n\nEven if there is something to reproduce the effect, should I go through all that trouble or just return this monitor and return to my search for glassy monitors?",

I am looking for a 27\" 1440p (144hz and up) screen that ideally is within £300 price range.\n\nAnything will probably be an upgrade at this point considering how outdated the current monitor I have is but there seems to be so many options.\n\nI don't really play competitive games that much anymore, but I do enjoy multiplayer FPS games like Battlefield 6 alongside singleplayer titles. I have looked into AOC Q27G3XMN but I've been reading some bad things about noticeable smearing and VRR flicker, also seen mixed opinions on Xiaomi G Pro 27i.\n\nSo here I am, asking for any advice, are there any hidden gems out there, monitors that are within that price range that are overlooked or ones you had good experiences with.\n\nEDIT: I use it for gaming but also for plenty of static content such as web browsing, youtube etc so any budget OLEDs if there even is any are probably a no no.",

    "selftext": "Hi /r/monitors 👋\n\nI'm replacing my wife's monitor, it's mostly for productivity but I'll occasionally use it for gaming. Mini LED feels like a great choice here, kind of a best of both worlds. I'd go for a great IPS panel, but given working needs, I'd rather not do an OLED. Targeting 27\" 4K, as 32\" feels a bit much.\n\nHowever, my wife insists that the new monitor be white. That really cuts down on the number of options -- even the monitors with a white backing plate, like BenQ EX321UX, tend to have a black bezel on the front.\n\nOne route would be to tape & cover the screen, then spraypaint, but that's risky. What I'd prefer is if the monitor can be disassembled enough to remove the bezel, then I go paint that separately. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on either:\n- Good monitors with a white bezel that satisfy my specs \n- Good monitors that hit my specs and can be safely disassembled enough to remove the bezel\n- Guides on how to most safely protect the screen in case of spray painting\n\nThank you!\n",

Nowadays we have plenty of good and reasonable priced gpus which can run 4K nicely (with upscaling) and modern console games looks great on 32\" 4K  (PS4, Xbox One X, PS5, Series X)\n\n1080p any refresh rate is the best for competitive responsive gaming without needing to sacrifice visuals if they matter, and with 24-27\" you get anyways decent picture for fast paced FPS games and again console games are also nice with smaller 1080p screens.\n\nSo these are my thoughts, in my case I have ditched 1440p for now, it was mistake at least in my experience.\nQHD is probably nice for productivity but...\nWhat you think about all this?",

    "selftext": "We’ve started a **partnership with Titan Army** and will be showcasing new models going forward (with honest community feedback) and probably some giveaways in the future. First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

    "title": "I'm Glad I Bought a Mini LED Monitor (MSI MAG 274QPF X30MV)",
    "selftext": "Firstly. WOW.\n\nI was honestly very skeptical about this monitor given that there are practically no reviews on it. But after using it and owning it I must say I am quite impressed and it sure exceeds my expectations.\n\nThe brightness 10/10. I flash banged myself on full screen white HDR video. (Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "ASUS ROG XG27AQDPG (500Hz 1440p QD-OLED) Written Review",
    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

    "selftext": "I’m replacing my 4-year-old Samsung G7 27” UHD IPS 144Hz.\n\nWhile waiting for the new tandem OLEDs to hit Europe (not this year), I decided to try a Chinese mini LED panel.\n\nAs a software engineer, my sweet spot is 1440p on a 27” (in 4k UI is too small), but at the same time I can’t give up playing AAA single-player titles with my RTX 5080 in 4K. \n\nSo my MacBook runs scaled at 2560×1440 when connected to the external monitor via HDMI, and my gaming PC at 3840×2160 on display port. \n\nRight now I can’t justify the price of a top-tier 4K OLED suited for productivity (text clarity), and honestly I don’t have the discipline to baby it against burn-in.\n\nSo I ordered a KOORUI S2741LM 27” QD Mini LED 4K 160Hz for true HDR, sharp text, no burn-in worries for 400€.\n\nI’m slightly concerned about warranty and after-sales support, but Amazon’s 14-day return helps.\n\nIf all goes well, I’ll hand this to my wife next year once I grab a tandem OLED (Gigabyte MO27Q28G looks great).\n\nFeedback coming next week when the Koorui lands — fingers crossed.\n\n---\nUPDATE: now I did something very stupid.\n\nI found out that the new tandem OLED, the Gigabyte MO27Q28G I was looking for, is finally available at LDLC (French store that ships to Italy too). So I purchased it (damn FOMO).\n\nI know this wasn’t a smart move :D\n\nNow I don’t know which one to keep:\n\nKoorui S2741LM -> mini LED 4k 160hz\n\nGigabyte MO27Q28G -> 4th gen OLED 2k 260hz",

    "title": "Resurrected dinosaur here with various questions about refresh rate options for matching media while on desktop on modern high refresh rate monitors plus VRR range",
    "selftext": "**Preface**\n\nThe last monitor I bought was in 2017 and was of a typical spec for the time 1080p 60 Hz IPS LCD. I have another one next to it I bought earlier in 2015. They're the ASUS MX279H and the VN247H. Presumably HDMI 1.4 and HDCP 1.4 compliant.\n\nI play some games, but I watch video media more. I'm quite sensitive to judder when the refresh rate does not match or is not a multiple of the framerate:\n\n* When watching 30p, 60i or 60p video I keep my monitor set to 60 Hz (good for North American and other formerly NTSC 60 Hz country's content, plus videos recorded on people's phones)\n* When watching 25p, 50i or 50p video I set my monitor to 50 Hz (typical as I live in Europe where everything is filmed and broadcasted for 50 Hz)\n* When watching 24p content I set my monitor to a custom 48 Hz and also experimented with a 72 Hz custom setting - lovely\n\nThe above settings make all video playback very enjoyable. I don't like looking at the judder of a 25p panning shot on a 60 Hz monitor and love having no judder when playing 24p at a refresh rate that is a multiple of 24.\n\n**Time to modernise**\n\nI have been upgrading my tech recently (no more Haswell-based system as I've build an AM5-based PC) and I am preparing to get into UHD gaming (likely with the help of FSR upscaling with the RX 9070 XT I have ordered). I have a few questions as I have never owned a high refresh monitor or one with a variable refresh rate (well, besides my new laptop with a range or 40 - 60 Hz VRR).\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. I'm looking at a 4K gaming monitor (LG 27GR93U) as the main monitor but I imagine these questions and answers apply to many models of monitors - it is a 144 Hz panel with VRR (48 - 144 Hz). I would like to default my Windows desktop to 120 Hz for ease of watching 24p, 30p and 60p content judder-free by default. Can I set the desktop resolution VRR range to be 48 - 120 Hz out of the box? \\*Judder-free video playback is more important to me than seeing more than 120 fps in video games. If this isn't commonly available, I might default to VRR off unless I'm gaming.\n2. When I want to watch 25p or 50p video content I'd like to manually set the screen to a 50 Hz (2\\*25, 1\\*50) or 100 Hz refresh rate (not 75 Hz as that's only good for 25p playback at 3\\*25, not 50p at 1.5\\*50). The manual to nearly every high refresh rate monitor I've looked at do not list 50 Hz and 100 Hz unless it is specifically a 100 Hz 1080p monitor. **May I kindly ask if some of you reading could check if your modern high refresh rate monitors have 50 Hz and 100 Hz options available within your Windows or GPU driver settings?** I would really appreciate it.\n3. I'm looking at getting a 1080p monitor as a second screen - one with HDCP 2.2 compliance like the LG 27GR93U has (looking at the Dell SE2425HG 1080p 200 Hz monitor). I have already seen that it supports 120 Hz so that is good for switching between 200 Hz when watching 25p (8\\*25) and 50p (4\\*50) content and 120 Hz for 24p (5\\*24), 30p (4\\*30) and 60p (2\\*60). **I've seen other 1080p monitors with weird refresh rates like 165 Hz** (bad for all video playback) **and 180 Hz** (only good for 30p and 60p playback). **If you have a monitor with these refresh rates, do you also have 120 Hz, 100 Hz and 50 Hz options? I'd love to know.**\n\n\\*Note: by judder-free I do not mean motion interpolation also known as TruMotion (LG), MotionFlow (Sony), Picture Clarity or Auto Motion Plus (Samsung) etc. I detest motion interpolation.\n\n**Final notes**\n\nI don't see too many people ask these questions online on other forums through Google searching and those who do rarely got good or knowledgeable answers. Many dismiss the OP's concerns, thinking that the higher the refresh rate, the better no matter what it is. Some have no idea about how mis-matching video content with framerate causes judder. 3:2 pulldown should be a term everyone knows but apparently not. If you have a look at your refresh rate options in your high refresh rate UHD monitor settings I'd be very grateful and more confident in what I buy. \n\nI encourage responses from as many people with as many different monitor models as available.\n\nWith Quick Media Switching limited to full screen video signals on UHD TVs (QMS), I hope that for PC monitors we'll see 2160p 600 Hz monitors one day (600 is the lowest common multiple for 24, 25, 30, 50 and 60). I don't care enough about 48p films to wish for a native 2160p 1200 Hz monitor.\n\nThank you.",

    "selftext": "Firstly. WOW.\n\nI was honestly very skeptical about this monitor given that there are practically no reviews on it. But after using it and owning it I must say I am quite impressed and it sure exceeds my expectations.\n\nThe brightness 10/10. I flash banged myself on full screen white HDR video. (Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "ASUS ROG XG27AQDPG (500Hz 1440p QD-OLED) Written Review",
    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

    "selftext": "i got really curious on ali express, and saw a listing for an mmcx mod for an outdated clip on headphone, the Phillips SHS4700, listed for 35cad (25usd) plus shipping. it came today, and as the title said i am surprised. i thought it would be a cheap sounding headphone, yknow like a replica of the phillips shs4700 but with mmcx like with those porta pro listings on ali express. but these aren’t half bad. just a note though, i am no audiophile but i will try to explain some thoughts of mine\n\nthe wires included are usable, but are not in any way durable. although, this isn’t bad since it’s already mmcx modded, so swapping chords is ok. mic is usable too, but not really good. it’s also usb c instead of 3.5mm\n\nclips are very uncomfortable without some adjustment, and the headphones are very small. if you have big ears, this headphone might not be for you. it’s pitifully small, and even makes my small ears look giant by comparison.\n\nin terms of sound, it’s actually usable. i’ll be using the ksc75s, as that is within the price range i paid for.\n\nin terms of sound leakage, because these are not open back, there is significantly less leakage, although it’s still there. i can probably wear these outside and not be a bother. \n\nin terms of sound quality, the headphones actually have slightly higher bass compared to the ksc75s. the treble is slightly recessed, and lacks some detail in that regard, but the mids are around the same. however, the ksc75s still offer better imaging and has a wider soundstage, probably due to the perks of having an open back design.\n\nstill, in terms of sound stage and detail, these aren’t half bad for the price. i was expecting little to no imaging whatsoever, especially from a product from ali-express.\n\nit even has detachable wires and a usable mic, which is already a plus compared to the ksc75s. with these, i don’t feel like i have to be as careful as i do with those pairs. \n\nto clarify, in terms of detail, soundstage and imaging, the ksc75s are better. however, this does have a slightly louder midbass, and i feel like i can swing this thing around my pocket without killing this thing forever. for my casual use case, i am satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "That cord always ends up tangled in my pocket, a tiny knot of chaos I have to spend minutes undoing. My clumsy fingers wrestle with the plastic wire, while people with wireless earbuds would’ve already finished two songs by now. It’s been too long—its rubber coating has started to get sticky, the volume button on the controller feels jammed, and sometimes there’s a faint electric buzz in the right ear. Maybe it’s time to replace it.\n\nBut I just can’t quit that little click when I plug it into my phone.\nSo soft, yet so solid.\nLike the sound of an old door lock turning, shutting the whole world out.\n\nWalking is the worst. The wire swings across my chest, rustling against my jacket’s zipper. On the stairs I have to hold it tight, or it’ll catch on the railing. Windy days are even worse—the wire tangles in my hair and pulls hard enough to hurt. I still remember that rainy day when my best friend and I huddled under the convenience store awning. She naturally took off her right earbud and handed it to me:\n“Listen—this intro is amazing.”\nA raindrop slid down the wire into my collar, cold and sharp. We stood together in that shared ninety centimeters of space, and the warmth of her body seemed to flow through the copper line. For a moment, the rain really did feel like decoration.\n\nNow my friend wears thousand-yuan noise-cancelling headphones, walking with confidence, never worrying about tangled cords. She says technology is great—it’s freed us from the wire.\nBut I’m still using this glitchy old pair, the left side fine, the right side buzzing now and then—only working if I hold it at just the right angle. Like me, struggling in that night without an ending—broken, stuttering, unclear.\n\nYesterday on my way to class, the wire snagged on my backpack strap again. I crouched to untie the knot while the person behind me clicked their tongue in annoyance. But honestly, I kind of enjoy this clumsiness. Wireless feels too perfect—perfect like a lie. The spotless charging case, the precise touch controls, never tangled, never messy. But my life is a tangle—why should my music be perfectly ordered?\n\nThis wired earphone has been with me for nearly three years. The braided cable is pilling, the gold plating on the plug worn thin. These flaws are like folded corners in an old diary, recording every ordinary day. Of course a new pair would be better—sleek and shiny—but it doesn’t know my ears. It hasn’t heard the song I played on repeat after you left during that fight. It doesn’t know the white noise that lulled me to sleep on sleepless nights.\n\nLast month I almost replaced it. I even placed the order for the newest model—then canceled it at 3 a.m. The customer service agent asked if there was a problem with the product.\n“No,” I said. “The problem’s with me.”\n—Nostalgia is a sickness with no cure.\n\nToday, as the taxi climbed the overpass, the right ear suddenly went silent. I instinctively twisted the yellowed plug, feeling the rough edge of the tape under my fingers. The river below flowed calmly, and in my left ear Eason Chan was singing:\n‘The water knows well—it’s my duty to cherish the flowers.’\nThe music sounded thin, like a bird that had lost one wing.\nAnd still, I never replaced these earphones.\n\nThe right one is dead now. So be it. One side is enough.\nThis worn-out cord I clung to—\nin the end, it couldn’t keep the two worlds playing in sync.",

    "selftext": "I've been getting annoyed recently because I bought the Samson Sr950s (30ohms) with the VE Odo (25mw). It sounded weak with my Redmi Note 11 plus Odo but sounded great on a friend's Iphone.

I've been contemplating buying the VE Devastator (110mw) but the amount of money I've spent already has disillusioned me from the audiophile dream and I've been considering selling them and getting the Ugreen Max Hitune 5c just for the convenience of a bluetooth headphone ( I also considered buying the Fiio Btr11 (30mw) since they have their own battery incase the problem was my phone power output).\n\n(My phone's not broken, my brother also has the same phone and it also sounded quiet, seems to me like either a software issue on the newer Hyper Os because I swear my old dacs sounded better a few years ago when it was still on MIUI or it can also be just a model specific problem)",

At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

I tried Float32 audio mode in Poweramp :\nAudio - Output settings - OpenSL ES output - Float 32 On - No DVC ON\n\nI decided to try it out to see if it really makes any difference in sound quality.\n\nHonestly, I wasn’t expecting much — I used the same earphones and the same phone as before, no hardware change at all. But once I switched to Float32, the sound quality clearly felt different.\n\nThe bass became smoother and more controlled, the transitions between instruments felt more natural, and even the vocals started standing out with more air and presence. Everything had a sense of space and depth that wasn’t there before.\n\nAfter reading up a bit, I found out that Float32 (32-bit floating point) audio gives the DAC more dynamic range and prevents clipping or distortion. So even though it doesn’t “boost” the sound, it processes it with more precision — which explains that clean and open feeling in the music.\n\nPretty cool to see how even a small thing like this can make a noticeable difference — and all that without changing a single piece of hardware!

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them.

The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI’m starting up a YouTube channel where I talk about Hi-Fi gear, but from the perspective of someone who mostly listens to bass-heavy music: hip-hop, R&B, reggaeton, metal, all the stuff that doesn’t usually get talked about much in the Hi-Fi space.\n\nI’m not asking for buying advice or comparisons, just looking to get some thoughts from people here about what kind of topics or angles would be cool to cover.\n\nI’ve got a few video ideas lined up already:\n\n1: Intro to the hobby : kind of an overview of what “Hi-Fi”actually is, why it’s fun even if your playlists are full of bass-heavy stuff, some common misconceptions, and how EQ can really help shape your sound. Also sort of some intro recs on how you can get a great setup for the same price you could wait a pair of ANC headphones or even less. \n\n2: Wireless ANC headphones: these are where most people start with higher-end gear, so I wanted to do something that talks about that whole category and how it fits into the hobby, especially for people who like tweaking sound profiles and are into bass heavy genres. \n\n3: Talking about my own gear: I’ve got a few headphones I love (HE1K Unveiled, Meze Empyrean 1) and thought it’d be fun to share what I like about them, how they respond to EQ, and how to get the sound you want out of your own setup.\n\nI think there’s room for more content that connects the “audiophile” side of things with the kind of music a lot of us listen to every day, but isn’t really represented in reviews or general talk of the hobby. Sort of give my thoughts on finding the perfect balance of a good thump in the bass, and a super clear rest of the song which just makes the music feel incredibly natural. If you’ve got ideas for what you’d want to see in that kind of channel, I’d love to hear them!\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to read, I’ll share the channel later once the first video’s up. Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT: one last thing, I speak Spanish fluently so I’m thinking of making a Spanish channel as well, if you’re here and speak Spanish and would like that lmk! Thanks! ",

    "selftext": "I was first drugged into using IEMs by a friend — that’s how it all started. I began with budget models like the Tangzu Wan’er, then moved up to the Truthear Hexa and Kefine Delci. I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

After 4–5 years of use, the battery isn’t as strong, and I’ve had to replace the pads twice. The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review]",
    "selftext": "[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)\n\n# HDB 630 Intro:\n\nSo, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.\n\nThis time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!\n\nThis new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*\n\nMarketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?\n\n# This is what’s included in the box:\n\nThe included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. \n\n**You get:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6\n\n* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.\n* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.\n* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.\n* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. \n* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.\n\nAll in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.\n\n# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: \n\nThe HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: \n\nThere’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. \n\nOther changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.\n\nThe general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.\n\n[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)\n\nOtherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. \n\nThe design changes can be seen in the following two images:\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 cup on the left, M4 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/a6wtcwhenewf1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e601cf55433326857406135f20f35765992239)\n\n[Source: Head-Fi – HDB 630 with new acoustic baffle mesh compared to the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/ryskm4yhnewf1.jpg?width=3566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbcf27131ebcec0186aebdd97233dc9a98f164)\n\n# Technology and Technical Specifications: \n\nThe HDB 630 features a 42 mm dynamic transducer, built in Tullamore, Ireland (as quite prominently visible in the inner parts of the earcups). The base of this transducer remains the same as on the M4 but due to the aforementioned new acoustic system with its new internal components as well as an entirely new tuning profile the sound results go way beyond just „a different tuning“. \n\n# Here's what else is on the spec sheet: \n\n* Up to 24-bit / 96 kHz USB-C, Bluetooth, or analog playback\n* 6 Hz - 40 kHz response (USB); 6 Hz – 22 kHz response (analog, Bluetooth)\n* Parametric EQ with A/B toggle and QR preset sharing (coming soon)\n* Sensitivity: 105 dB SPL (@ 1 kHz / 0 dB FS)\n* THD: <0.2% (@1 kHz / 100 dB SP)\n* Crossfeed mode inspired by HE 1\n* Bluetooth 5.2 with native aptX Adaptive codec support\n* Hi-res USB-C transmitter dongle included (BTD 700)\n* Adaptive ANC and transparency modes\n* 60 hours battery life + rapid charge (10mins charge for 7hr playtime)\n\n[The outer earcups are less prone to fingerprints on the HDB 630 than on the M4.](https://preview.redd.it/mqbecaiznewf1.jpg?width=5022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09c287c526312210c08a94f6c03f3db75e4fe1a)\n\n# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:\n\nWhen it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?\n\nIn a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.\n\nThis becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \\[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\\]:\n\n[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)\n\n[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)\n\n[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)\n\n\n\nStrictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.\n\nIts (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. \n\nCompared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. \n\nKeep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.\n\n# Real World Sound Impressions:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.\n\nRegardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.\n\nThe bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.\n\nThe mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.\n\nThe presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. \n\nSo, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…\n\n[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)\n\n# Crossfeed:\n\nIn the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23\n\nCrossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.\n\nCrossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.\n\nSince this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!\n\n# Parametric EQ:\n\nThis is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!\n\nThe major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.\n\nFinally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.\n\nAnd for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.\n\nPersonally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.\n\nOf course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!\n\nHere are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:\n\n[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)\n\nThere’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf957zd4rewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f986c70bcb0efaf94733dc08856c3f74cf62a57c\n\n# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: \n\nLet’s keep this section short and simple for a change. \n\nThe ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. \n\nWith regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192\n\n# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)\n\nPhew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? \n\nFor me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”\n\nIt uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.\n\nThe sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.\n\nFeature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.\n\nANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.\n\nIn essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. \n\nComing in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nThe Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y320tjf0sewf1.jpg?width=7268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abd7d7d38e7be6435f8318cdee87eff461baae81",

I disliked the sound so much that I immediately refunded it. Not only were the tuning too V shaped, it also had severe driver quality issues like channel mismatch, phase mismatch, and group delay that made the sound incredibly distorted. (i.e. the female sopranos would break and the bass would echo)\n\nI decided to give QC 2 a try since pretty much all the ANC headphones are not that good and I really need a set for commuting and video calls. Sonys were just too uncomfortable with drivers pressing against my pinna as well as concerns about the hinge.\n\n# Build & ANC\n\nThe QCU2 has the same build as QCU1, with the hinge section being metal-wrapped plastic instead of metallic painted plastic. ANC is the same as well.\n\nThe ANC is basically the same too, as well as Sony XM5 & XM6\n\nBy default the adaptive ANC is on, the full ANC only kicks in when there's loud volume. The reason? The white noise at max ANC is quite strong on this model and you will definitely hear it in quieter places. However, this also means the full ANC only kicks in 1-2 seconds after noise starts playing, and you definitely feel the pressure building up. You don't have this in Sonys, but it's not a fair comparison since Sony's are effectively on-ears.\n\n# Sound Signature\n\n100% in the right direction.\n\nUnlike QCU1, it got rid of the ATH-M50X -like base hump below 100Hz so it no longer has that fake boomy feel. I know some people like that for example those who likes to blast loud EDM from their BMW cars, but most audiophiles like me hate them with a passion.\n\nMids are fine, it has a recess between 1-2kHz typical of audiophile-grade sets like HD490 Pro and HiFiMan stuff to create a sense of wider soundstage. As a result, the peak at 2kHz is slightly sharp imo but tolerable.\n\nThe high trebles are definitely tuned to the Knowles curve which was all the craze recently (basically doesn't decay as fast above 8kHz unlike the Harman curve). The theory is it works well for older people whose hearing has declined. However, I'm in late 20's and according to the AirPods diagnostics I've no hearing decline at all. The treble is definitely too much for me, the cymbals just has too much presence that's not needed.\n\nWhat amazed me was despite the bright trebles it doesn't have sibilance which is huge for female vocals. in fact it's so incredibly controlled I don't hear it at all in challenging songs like UNDEAD (YOASOBI). The piercing 's' becomes natural breathing. Well done Bose.\n\n**EQ suggestion:** Fine on default for older people. Younger people: Bass -2 \\~ +2 (adjust bass to your liking, -2 is close to reference but many people likes to add a punch), Mids 0, Treble -2.\n\n# Driver Quality\n\nI would say it's a night a day compared to QCU1. While the rtings reviews are not out yet, I can definitely say it no longer has the artifacts and distortion that was immediately obvious on QCU1\n\nHowever, like many headphones these days, my unit has a slight channel mismatch between 8-10kHz. It happens on brands like HiFiMans too and might be unit dependent so I'm not gonna dwell on it. Just note it's not gonna be like a proper pair of Sennheisers that's for sure.\n\n# Spatial Audio\n\nNot good. Makes the sound even more treble heavy and quite a lot worse than Apple's implementation. Even a basic Jan Meier crossfeed filter would have achieved better results\n\n# Verdict\n\nProbably the best you can buy in the ANC Headphones category right now. Not because it's amazing or anything, but rather all of its competitors have severe compromises. The QCU2 scores decent in the triad of comfort, sound quality, and ANC ability. Other headphones all need you to severely compromise one of the three, even in more expensive products like HDB630/Focal Bathys where you gain slightly in sound quality but lose huge on ANC.",

    "title": "Grado Alessandro MS1 - Full Internal Damping & Acoustic Treatment.",
    "selftext": "Hey fellows,\nI've finally completed a comprehensive internal mod on my Alessandro MS1 (which shares its core design with the Grado SR125). As many of you know, Grados are famous for their energetic sound, but this often comes with a trade-off: harsh treble peaks and lingering resonances (often seen as \"ringing\" in CSD plots, like those on DIY-Audio-Heaven:\n https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/brands-g-n/sr125i/\n\nAs measurements shows Grado morphology leds into catastrophic resonances!\n\nMy goal was to refine this sound by tackling those resonances and internal reflections, aiming for a cleaner, smoother, yet still lively Grado experience.\n\nHere's what went into the mod:\n\n1) Driver Back Damping:\n\nI started by applying Dynamat Xtreme to the entire back of the driver's magnet structure. The Dynamat here adds significant mass and vibration damping, which is crucial for reducing mechanical resonances and tightening up the bass response. You can see this stage in the first photo, where some Dynamat is exposed before the final felt layer.\n\n2) Full Driver Acoustic Absorption:\n\nRecognizing that even the rubberized surface of Dynamat can still reflect sound, I then meticulously covered all the treated surfaces on the back of the driver with red felt. \nThis porous felt acts as an excellent acoustic absorber and diffuser, eliminating internal reflections that could otherwise color the sound, especially in the midrange and treble. This step is key to smoothing out those notorious Grado peaks. \n\nBeyond the driver, the internal cups themselves were also treated with Dynamat and felt to further control resonances and reflections.\n\nThe Impact on Sound:\n\nAfter some listening, I'm genuinely impressed with the transformation. The \"Grado magic\" is still present, but it's now accompanied by a level of control and refinement I hadn't experienced before:\nThe treble is significantly less fatiguing and sibilant, offering a smoother, yet still highly detailed presentation. No more \"ice pick\" highs!\nThe midrange feels cleaner and more articulate, benefiting from the reduced internal reflections.\nThe bass is noticeably tighter and more impactful, without any unwanted boominess or lingering decay.\nIt's still very much a Grado, but it's a Grado that lets you enjoy extended listening sessions without the harshness. It truly feels like a \"refined\" version of its original self.\n",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.  As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I’ve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of “never listen to audio equipment you can’t afford” had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show.  Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn’t familiar with. They were both good – the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.  However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge – small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.  I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I’d never listened to before. It’s certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I’d given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there’s just something my ears don’t agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn’t find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I’d have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI’ve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.  There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.  My take away – always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.  I really didn’t like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting – a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it’s open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI’ve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.  I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So… I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don’t care if they’re a bit less comfortable – I main Grados. I’m used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn’t spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** – they’re in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan’er (which I have a pair of – they’re my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu’s sound signature. Detail-wise, they’re both about equals.  I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** – a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them – they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.  As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said “ you have to listen to this system”, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass – exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn’t all that interested in them so didn’t try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn’t find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual “studio” brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren’t there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "DO NOT RECOMMEND OR PURCHASE!!\n\nThe Heavys H1H headphones, marketed for metal fans with an eight-driver design, promised durability and premium sound for $485. Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones’ headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden’s Run to the Hills. The app’s EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The “Hell Blocker” noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

While it has a midbass peak somewhere, likely at 200hz which is common among closed backs, I very much do not dislike it! The midrange is a little forward, and the treble has some peaks that I am very certain is down to the resin chamber.\n\nThis is purely a for fun project, not final as I plan to do stamped metal as the actual chamber for my closed back. There is fog that generates inside the chambers which doesn't look pretty, but overall, I think looks very cool!

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them.

    "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI'm here today to ask you about the dongle DAC's that is usable with Windows-based PC.\n\nI know there are a lot of them for different price points, and I guess I didn't need them too much, because I only got easy to drive SGH 9500 and Beyers 770 Pro X LE (that are stupidly broken by themselves in the can connection points with very light gentle use and now I'm awaiting for them to return from the service), but now I want to try IEM's and I guess I need a better source then my motherboard audio.\n\nFor the start I don't want to get anything crazy, simply because I'm in Ukraine and I try to keep my purchases relatively cheap, so that's why I want to go under 100 USD with dongle or something portable.\n\nBut as far as I know the things that work well with the phones may have some issues on the PC side of things.\n\nSo I need a dongle, that have a clear sound and also didn't fall asleep, disconnect rapidly or have driver problems on the PC.\n\nI will get something better if there will be safe again, but for now I need something reliable and fun.\n\nI was thinking about Apple Dongle and TRN Black Pearl, but I heard that TRN one have some issues with entering a standby mode so it can fade out notifications etc. And the driver is not too good for the PC use.\n\nI'll happily read all your recommendations, thank you so much in advance.  \n",

The mesh around it too get earwax on them, needing to clean them every few days.  \nIt's just become a regular routine for me to clean off my earwax atleast once a day to avoid getting my ears shut off due to the wax. Was not too confident with hydrogen peroxide, so got an ear camera cleaning tool by bebird, and honestly it is quite good to use.  \nThe scoop is silicone based so i dont feel much sceptical about it to not put in my ear... However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025.

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "title": "Poweramp - Surprised to see how the “Float32” option improved the sound quality significantly",
    "selftext": "I noticed something interesting recently. I tried Float32 audio mode in Poweramp :\nAudio - Output settings - OpenSL ES output - Float 32 On - No DVC ON\n\nI decided to try it out to see if it really makes any difference in sound quality.\n\nHonestly, I wasn’t expecting much — I used the same earphones and the same phone as before, no hardware change at all. But once I switched to Float32, the sound quality clearly felt different.\n\nThe bass became smoother and more controlled, the transitions between instruments felt more natural, and even the vocals started standing out with more air and presence. Everything had a sense of space and depth that wasn’t there before.\n\nAfter reading up a bit, I found out that Float32 (32-bit floating point) audio gives the DAC more dynamic range and prevents clipping or distortion. So even though it doesn’t “boost” the sound, it processes it with more precision — which explains that clean and open feeling in the music.\n\nPretty cool to see how even a small thing like this can make a noticeable difference — and all that without changing a single piece of hardware! Thought I’d share this here since some of you might find it interesting too.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/4ulrwz8x1rwf1.png?width=2130&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd2aba14f52d8ec06ac38dc280de34349e96b76\n\nSo I've eq'ed before but usual more towards a specific target frequency rather than what I want in my sound. The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

Thank you.\n\nI am someone who was originally aiming towards the Creative Aurvana Ace 3s, but love the sound profile of the Jlabs too much (I use the Knowles Sound Profile with a bump in the bass) and thought why not upgrade to the headphones instead of the TWS to compensate for the difference in soundstage and generational gap as the Epic Lab Edition TWS are a few years dated now compared to the Creatives.",

Once I get that sorted, I will definitely measure them, but for now you are going to have to rely on my impressions.\n\nThe bass is not bad at all! It is tight, quick, and honestly fun. While it has a midbass peak somewhere, likely at 200hz which is common among closed backs, I very much do not dislike it! The midrange is a little forward, and the treble has some peaks that I am very certain is down to the resin chamber.\n\nThis is purely a for fun project, not final as I plan to do stamped metal as the actual chamber for my closed back. There is fog that generates inside the chambers which doesn't look pretty, but overall, I think looks very cool! Everything is hand assembled and designed by me.\n\nThe pads are Yaxi ST pads, the drivers are 40mm titanium speakers that I am currently working on with a manufacturer, and the resin chamber is made by facfox.",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

At first, I was slightly afraid they were fakes, but after listening, I am fairly sure they are the real deal.\n\nTheir value is STRONG. The cable is braided below the Y-split. Makes them appear a bit more refined, I guess. These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them.

I have very, very small hands so the grip needs to be improve. \n2. I'm having neck and arms muscle pain so maybe a pillow? \n3. Stick grips. Any recommendations? \n\nBonus: skin for aesthetic without adding volume / weight would be welcome! \n\nBasically I think the deck is still quite heavy and bulk for me. So I'd really like to avoid accessories that might make it heavier or bulkier. \n\nThanks a lot! \n",

    "selftext": "I know it is still far away. But with the new Xbox \"SteamDeck\" released here I a few things I would love the see in an updated SteamDeck.\n\nLet me start by saying that I am not going to talk about advances in the performace of hardware. Those I presume are given and will not really much be in the decision of Valve.\n\n**Hardware features**\n\n* 5G (or perhaps 6G by that point) Modem\n   * While it is quite easy to just take your phone and enable the hotspot feature, it is another link that adds latency.\n   * Just take the SD slot and have it be a SD/SIM card slot or even just use an eSIM. \n   * Even adding basic phone capabilities, like being able to accept a call or text while gaming would be awesome. With most operators now providing the option to clone your SIM, this would be perfect.\n* Fast/er charging + bigger battery.\n   * The 45 W is nice. But being able to quickly charge to 50 % in 20 minutes with a 120 W charger would be awesome. Though it should be said that it would degrade the battery quicker. Maybe something like a quick charge in quick options button that would allow you to activate it could solve this.\n   * Having a larger battery is also good/bad. Added weight might not be something many people want. But I personally do.\n* 2/or more USB ports\n   * 2 USB C ports (one on top and one on the bottom) I believe is something that will get implemented. But now image, if they added a third one! And perhaps even have it be a a USB type A for easier use with things like USB sticks or an older mouse you just have laying around.\n\n**Software features**\n\n* More \"in house\" Apps\n   * Things like a SteamOS Youtube app, Netflix, A videoplayer.\n   * I know these things are fairly easily accesable by adding non-steam games executables. But that is work for a \"normie\" that he doesn't want to do. Just have them included. There could even be a switch between gaming/destop/theater mode. With even more specific controls for media in theater mode.\n   * I think this specifically could transform the SteamDeck from just a portable console to a truly special device. A portable home entertaintment system.",

I think getting a case included with purchase is great, however I love to motorcycle camp where every ounce and inch of packing space is accounted for and I would like a slim solution. I have looked a the Dbrand Killswitch and a similar jsaux solution and it is close but not exactly what I am looking for. \n\nI’d rather not have a rubber grip around the console itself.\nI’d like to find a travel cover only that would protect the front of the system -screen and sticks \n\nI know this is neurotic and I am being to particular. However in all of my hype/research of watching tons of YouTube reviews I have the impression there is a cover only solution for the Steam Deck where a top plate can go on top of the system and there is a wrap around band that secures it to the system itself. I could be mistaken but wanted to see if someone is aware of something like this. \n\nUltimately I want to just protect the screen and joysticks, while remaining slim in profile, not adding rubber protectors around the system itself. Thank you to anyone indulging my curiosity and taking the time to read this.",

For starters I've only played one game on steam and that's palworld before I got my ps5. Note I have no PC and used my laptop to play and it was so laggy. I also just bought the steam deck last week. So the other games I've played on my laptop are romance viual novels. So what I'm wondering is if there's a way to get those onto my steam deck? ",

It was so loud my kids were shaken up. I had to force a shut down to get it to stop. Once it stopped, it powered off but the fan was on max speed. I turned it back on to see if it would function and the fan turned off and it booted fine, but the noises were so loud that the right speaker is blown. \n\nI reached out to steam but of course my deck is out of warranty. \n\nThey suggested I send it in for repair, but I guess I'm a little concerned that it's more than just the blown speaker. Seems odd that it could damage itself in this manner. \n\nThe repair would ~$125 but the DIY kit to repair the speaker is less than half. \n\nAnyone else experience this? Or has anyone performed this repair feel it's worth sending it in? ",

    "selftext": "After a few days of scouring the internet and testing out different things, I finally found settings which im happy with. I will pretty much summarize everything for you all and give the solutions to these problems here [Fletchling of death, random crashes every 15 minutes, cant leave the lab],  stable 60fps (sometimes there are a few dips but lowest ive seen it drop to so far has only been 40 fps in some areas). Do note that these numbers are with lossless scaling(highly recommended) which I find to have completely uplifted the quality for me.\n\nEmulator: Ryubing Canary 1.3.187\n\nFirstly, dont play the game with the dlc and update, I didn't get any luck trying to even start the game with those enabled. I will also not be covering where to get these files or how to setup the emulator and so on.\n\nSettings:\n\nSD Settings:\nLimit clock speed to 1000MHz and TDP of 10W(Up to you really)\n\nRyubing Settings:\nPPTC: on\nCPU Mode: I tried Host unchecked (Fastest, unsafe) and it worked fine for me. If not then just switch to host(fast)\nGraphics: Vulkan \nMultithreading: Auto\nShader Cache: on\nMacro HLE: on\nResolution: Native\nScaling filter: Bilinear\n\n\nLossless scaling:\n\n2x\nBetween 50-60% Flow Scale, lower = less quality but more fps. Try see what works best to you, I set mine to 50.\nPresent Mode FIFO VSync On\nPerformance Mode On\n\nProblems:\n\nThis is probably what most of you are reading this for so this is what worked out for me.\n\n1. Fletchling of Death\n\nYou'll have to transfer your save file from Ryujinx to Eden, then back to Ryujinx. On Ryujinx, save your game just before the cutscene then transfer it to Eden. Once you're on Eden, just go through the cutscene and save after you're done, then transfer back to Ryujinx. Hint: you only need to transfer the 'main' file.\n\n2. Game crashing every 10 minutes\n\n What worked for me was switching from the stable build of ryubing to ryubing canary and the game ran smoother\n\n3. Cant leave Lab\n\nAfter digging around, some people mentioned that this is due to corrupt files in the ROM. For me, I verified the integrity of my ROM on Eden and it said that it was corrupted. I downloaded a different file, replaced the old one and verified again and it was successful. After that I just boot up ryujinx and was able to go through the cutscene without problems. This may also be the root cause of the problem for the Fletchling of Death, just a hypothesis though, i didn't test it.\n\nMods:\n\nYou can search for a whole folder of mods for the game, just search for Switch-Ultrawide -Mods Github and you'll find it. I did not go through every single mod, I just enabled these and found they looked good to me and the game was still stable so I just ran with it. Not sure bout the others though.\n\n1. Improved FOV\n2. Reduce Bloom\n3. Disable DOF\n\nI am by no means a professional at this, quite the opposite really, tried everything that people recommended online so im just sharing my experience because I almost gave up on trying to emulate this game lol. Do note that im not that far into the game yet so there may be more problems that I'll run into.\n\nHappy gaming, hope this helped :)\n\nEdit: Formatting\n",

My battery suddenly died and the Steam Deck wouldn't turn back on or charge (no charging light). \n\nAfter leaving it plugged in for a day, and unplugged for a day, it turned back on and the charging indicator light returned. But it had the NaN% battery charge bug. Luckily, after much troubleshooting (and stumbling on a single helpful steam comment) I was able to resolve the error.\n\nFinally, after a full charge I went back to Ball x Pit, had a normal session. Out of an abundance of caution I went to quit the game, and when I did, not only did the game crash, but the entire system died again. Luckily this time it powered back on no problem, but I've been scared to play the game again on Steam Deck, and have been playing Witcher 3 since then with no issues.\n\nI know I'm being paranoid, but could a game really cause battery issues like that? I've found no leads online.\n\nTL;DR: Steam Deck crashed twice playing Ball x Pit, once leading to a battery error I almost had to RMA. Is it possible a game could be causing this?",

I just submitted a claim for a cracked screen and it was denied. Reason stated that the Steam Deck is not covered by Home Plus.\n\nI wanted to give people a heads up on their service and products.\n\n\nUPDATE: Hello everyone, I wanted to give an update. Shoutout to u/Asurion_Alex for helping me get in contact with Asurion. A supervisor got in contact with me and helped me re-file a claim and it got accepted.\nWhat had happened was, I first submitted a claim through the mobile app, but because something was missing or i didnt answer correctly it was rejected. I then called the same day to refile a claim over the phone. I answered all the questions and provided all need info but it was rejected a 2nd time. I posted here and at r/Asurion, and u/Asurion_Alex gave me a POC to reach out to. A supervisor reached out to me within a few hours. It was explained to me that when the first claim was rejected, and I resubmitted a 2nd claim, the first one did not clear quickly enough and thus the 2nd claim was rejected due to the first claim, or at least that was close to what was explained to me. \n\nI wanted to thank everyone for their responses and feedback. It great to see when a community comes together to support fellow Redditors.\n\nAdditional Info: I have had this plan for over a year, so I was past the initial 31 days. Some people may disagree with warranties/insurance programs, and it is true I have had some both good and bad experiences. But overall this is a success, there is no indication that my premium will go up. So at the end of the day this is a win.",

I am surprised to say that it is playable, though has some major caveats. It will stick to 30 FPS most of the time, but can regularly drop quickly to 28 FPS, with some bigger drops and stutters when entering and leaving buildings and towns.\n\nI also tested Lossless Scaling, which works to some degree, with some parts of the game feeling very smooth with no input lag using 2X, but go into cities and we have some big slowdowns that just feel awful. I personally don't recommend using it, but it does work to some degree, so I can understand the reasoning to try it out.\n\nYou can check out more details in our written or video impressions about performance!\n\n[Written](https://steamdeckhq.com/news/the-outer-worlds-2-is-just-barely-playable-on-the-steam-deck-first-impressions/)\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9czTJtLflpI)",

I have very, very small hands so the grip needs to be improve. \n2. I'm having neck and arms muscle pain so maybe a pillow? \n3. Stick grips. Any recommendations? \n\nBonus: skin for aesthetic without adding volume / weight would be welcome! \n\nBasically I think the deck is still quite heavy and bulk for me. So I'd really like to avoid accessories that might make it heavier or bulkier. \n\nThanks a lot! \n",

I just submitted a claim for a cracked screen and it was denied. Reason stated that the Steam Deck is not covered by Home Plus.\n\nI wanted to give people a heads up on their service and products.\n\n\nUPDATE: Hello everyone, I wanted to give an update. Shoutout to u/Asurion_Alex for helping me get in contact with Asurion. A supervisor got in contact with me and helped me re-file a claim and it got accepted.\nWhat had happened was, I first submitted a claim through the mobile app, but because something was missing or i didnt answer correctly it was rejected. I then called the same day to refile a claim over the phone. I answered all the questions and provided all need info but it was rejected a 2nd time. I posted here and at r/Asurion, and u/Asurion_Alex gave me a POC to reach out to. A supervisor reached out to me within a few hours. It was explained to me that when the first claim was rejected, and I resubmitted a 2nd claim, the first one did not clear quickly enough and thus the 2nd claim was rejected due to the first claim, or at least that was close to what was explained to me. \n\nI wanted to thank everyone for their responses and feedback. It great to see when a community comes together to support fellow Redditors.\n\nAdditional Info: I have had this plan for over a year, so I was past the initial 31 days. Some people may disagree with warranties/insurance programs, and it is true I have had some both good and bad experiences. But overall this is a success, there is no indication that my premium will go up. So at the end of the day this is a win.",

I am surprised to say that it is playable, though has some major caveats. It will stick to 30 FPS most of the time, but can regularly drop quickly to 28 FPS, with some bigger drops and stutters when entering and leaving buildings and towns.\n\nI also tested Lossless Scaling, which works to some degree, with some parts of the game feeling very smooth with no input lag using 2X, but go into cities and we have some big slowdowns that just feel awful. I personally don't recommend using it, but it does work to some degree, so I can understand the reasoning to try it out.\n\nYou can check out more details in our written or video impressions about performance!\n\n[Written](https://steamdeckhq.com/news/the-outer-worlds-2-is-just-barely-playable-on-the-steam-deck-first-impressions/)\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9czTJtLflpI)",

I have very, very small hands so the grip needs to be improve. \n2. I'm having neck and arms muscle pain so maybe a pillow? \n3. Stick grips. Any recommendations? \n\nBonus: skin for aesthetic without adding volume / weight would be welcome! \n\nBasically I think the deck is still quite heavy and bulk for me. So I'd really like to avoid accessories that might make it heavier or bulkier. \n\nThanks a lot! \n",

    "title": "Turn ESP32 devices into through-wall motion sensors",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

    "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking to add some automation to my home for the very first time. I am looking to start by purchasing a smart lock for my front door. I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "selftext": "Christmas post… thinking about it already! I’m looking for a compact smart plug that sits between an outlet and a device. When the device powers on that is plugged in, the plug should detect the change in electricity or sense that it turned on and trigger an Alexa routine. No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

    "selftext": "My parents have a lovely little property with a garden and a few acres of land. It’s their pride and joy... they take care of it all themselves, from flower beds to chickens.\n\nBut lately I’ve noticed it’s becoming harder for them to keep track of everything.... Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar? Any recommendations for brands or setups that don’t need heavy installation or complicated apps?",

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup?

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

No hardwiring—I want a simple, plug-and-play solution.\n\nOr an alternative… let me explain\n\nWhy: my spouse a vintage Hallmark “treeluminator decoration”. It’s this old school thing that when you push the lever, it wirelessly turns on an outlet connected to the Christmas tree and plays music too. It predates smart devices. I’ve hooked up all our other Christmas lights on Alexa plugs, but it makes me spouse sad that their vintage thing only works with the one plug. \n\nWe love the tactile, push-down magic and we’ve had it forever, but I also want to make it part of my Alexa smart home. For example, I’d like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug… I’m open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t•\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t•\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t•\tI’m open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn’t require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

    "selftext": "My parents have a lovely little property with a garden and a few acres of land. It’s their pride and joy... they take care of it all themselves, from flower beds to chickens.\n\nBut lately I’ve noticed it’s becoming harder for them to keep track of everything.... Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar? Any recommendations for brands or setups that don’t need heavy installation or complicated apps?",

Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I read online that I need to consider the total wattage that the dimmer will support (e.g. if  I have two strings connected together I would need a dimmer that can support: 60 bulbs x 7 watts each bulb= total 420 watts) and that it's compatible with the listed 31 voltage, right?

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

    "title": "Reverse-engineering DPS 101 on LEDVANCE Tuya RGBIC lamp - unknown LED indices cause device reboot",
    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

AC doesnt support a wifi function so it won't work with the TCL home app. The Smart IR blaster is an OEM tuya remote. \n\nI first tried to consult this to an AI model but it said that remotes often transmit a long code containing temperature, modes and whatnot and that the IR receiver of the blaster might not be picking that long code and only picking up a quick bit of it.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAfter years of saying I’d never get into the whole smarthome thing (“I can just get off the couch and turn on the lights myself”), I’ve finally caved.  \nUp until now, my only smart device was my robot vacuum — *Consuela* — but it’s time for something new.\n\nI want to build a **wake-up light** setup in my bedroom that can also double as extra lighting during the darker winter months.\n\n**The plan:**  \nI’m thinking of installing a **4–5 meter LED strip** between the edge of my dropped ceiling and my curtains, using an L-profile so the light shines down and bounces softly off the curtains. Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

(Some things are more comokicated but with enough time i can handle it) So i would love to have the visualisation over HA. \n\nBUT; What would be the best/easiest way to set up the rest/electricity? This should be more of an easy/straight forward thing. Should run when we move into the house. I can set the HA things later. \n\nI Thought KNX would be the way, but there are still a few disadvantages:\n\n- I cant program ETS by myself\n- I would like to have the main functions to work with KNX (heating, shading, lights, main door lock, garage door) to be controled over switches AND something like a Shelly walldisplay which should have all functions.\n\nSo my questions is:\n-Is it possible to control shading, main door lock etc. also over HA? (Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

I know it’s not the most secure option, but honestly, having a remote lying around in the driveway isn’t great either.\n\nI’m looking for a simple, weather-resistant (lots of rain) fingerprint reader that can be managed directly on the device, via a web interface, or through an app. Ideally, it should also integrate with Home Assistant.\n\nThere are a lot of Chinese models on the market, but it’s hard to tell which ones are reliable. I’ve looked into Anviz. The P7 is still available locally but seems to be EOL, and the C2 Slim appears to be out of stock everywhere.\n\nDoes anyone have other suggestions or recommendations for specific models?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

Some time ago I bought several electrical sockets [like this one](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BTM3V7Z5?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) from different brands (Brennenstuhl, Aldi, Surnice). They are all cross-compatible i.e. I could train them on all three different remotes I have. \n\nHowever I was wondering if there was a tool available that would act as a remote but be connected to an App on my phone. Is that understandable?\n\n  \nIf you have any hints what I'm actually looking/searching for, kindly tell :)",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

We mostly use lamps with Hue bulbs in this room and I thought I could replace that dead switch with a remote to toggle a scene in my HomeKit setup instead of futzing with phones or assistants.\n\nThe Hue dimmer does what I want _technically_ but I would love something that fits behind a Decora plate. The walls are wood panelled so repairs/changes are painful. It would be nice to make use of the switch position I already have.\n\nThen there’s the various smart switches/scene controllers/Shelly type relays available. The Shelly’s “detached mode” almost sounds like what I want, except I don’t need to connect it to a load. I just want to tap into the AC (there’s a neutral in the box) to keep the thing powered and hook it up to a momentary switch to toggle a scene. I’m struggling to figure out: will any of these products work without being physically connected to a device? Or am I completely overlooking a solution to the “give me a regular ass wall switch to turn all the lamps on” problem?",

Any reviews from anyone using these in their home ? \n\nLink provided in case you’re are curious.

Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility?

Like… how many nights did I sleep like a baby behind a fake lock? 😂\n\nLiving alone, that realization was not the vibe. Swapped it out for a smart one that locks itself when the door shuts,no drilling, no wiring, just sticks inside and does its thing.\n\nFeels weirdly good hearing it click now.\n\nAnyone else ever discover something this dumb in your place after years of living there?\n\n",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

(Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

Browsed to their site (us.sengled.com) and they have an \"opening soon\" message that their store will be taking a break from 10/6 to 10/20 (already passed lol).\n\nI opened the Sengled app today for the first time in a month or 2, just to see if anything there had changed. Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.",

AC doesnt support a wifi function so it won't work with the TCL home app. The Smart IR blaster is an OEM tuya remote. \n\nI first tried to consult this to an AI model but it said that remotes often transmit a long code containing temperature, modes and whatnot and that the IR receiver of the blaster might not be picking that long code and only picking up a quick bit of it.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAfter years of saying I’d never get into the whole smarthome thing (“I can just get off the couch and turn on the lights myself”), I’ve finally caved.  \nUp until now, my only smart device was my robot vacuum — *Consuela* — but it’s time for something new.\n\nI want to build a **wake-up light** setup in my bedroom that can also double as extra lighting during the darker winter months.\n\n**The plan:**  \nI’m thinking of installing a **4–5 meter LED strip** between the edge of my dropped ceiling and my curtains, using an L-profile so the light shines down and bounces softly off the curtains. Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5.

Not a low battery notification- as it goes off until I pull battery out. \nI purchased new one a few days ago, doing same exact thing. \n\nI only use this as a back up, in bedroom, as I do have X-Sense throughout home (smoke/carbon monoxide detectors.)\n\nBut this is a nuisance and really want to know why. And, if I should try another new one. \n\nHome is not dusty. I do have a tall floor fan I use in bedroom but have always had it running and never did alarms do this in past (only recently). Located about 10 feet from detector that is installed 1 foot below ceiling above door. \n\nPhoto is new one. \n\n\n",

    "title": "5 year old unopened iPads won't charge. Is there any reasonable hope?",
    "selftext": "Back in 2020, we purchased about 100 iPads for one reason or another. I think something to do with Telehealth. Most of them were used and rolled out to the world, with no problems. \n\nNow it's late 2025, and we have about 20 iPads that we haven't taken out of the box yet. Of these, I believe so far we've found 6 iPads that refuse to turn on and stay on. \n\nWhen plugged into the stock charger (these are older gen 2 pro iPads, so they came with Apple Chargers), they will show the Apple logo for about 3-5 seconds, before it goes away, seemingly turning off, pausing for another 3-5 seconds, and showing the Apple logo again. Not my video, but it looks like this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U\\_wjIpfyXE8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U_wjIpfyXE8) but with a white logo on black background and a different model iPad\n\nSince I have so many brokenish iPads, my coworkers and I have been able to try a few things.   \nFirst, I tried overnight charging with the stock charger.   \nI tried overnight with a faster charger, which was a laptop charger.   \nI tried overnight with a slower charger, which is the USB port on my computer. \n\nThen I tried booting into recovery mode (I believe called DFU mode). I do this a lot, I'm familiar with how the process works.   \nWhen trying to use my desktop to do this, it isn't even getting enough power to show the little computer and plug symbols.   \nWhen trying to boot into recovery while plugged into the wall with the stock charger, it will show the symbol and it will stay on (more on that next), but obviously I can't restore the iPad if I'm plugged up to the wall.   \nNext I tried recovery mode from a laptop that has a thunderbolt port, which seems to have more power in the USB port than my desktop. This would briefly flip to showing the computer and plug symbol, before turning itself off and back on to the Apple symbol. \n\nThe laptop also had one of those ports with a battery+ symbol, but it seemed to power the iPad less than the Thunderbolt port.   \nI also had a powered dock, with the same battery+ symbol that behaved the same. \n\nSince the iPad will seemingly stay on for a few minutes when in recovery mode, I also tried leaving it there for a few minutes. Normal iPad behavior turns that off after a few minutes, and this does the same, putting it back in the bootloop. \n\n  \nWe believe the problem is that the iPad is so dead that it can't start the firmware needed to properly initiate charging. A potential solution to this would be a jumpstart, but not only would we not know how to do this, but it could be dangerous. The other solution would be to take the battery out, charge it externally, and put it back together. We have a lot of iPads that are broken, however, and no experience doing this. Assuming it's even possible. ",

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case. \n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well. \n\n\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**",

I can turn it and it can sit in a different way and it just looks like something you put on the desk that says \"asus\" as a decoration. But it can't just be that, because its connected to 3 hookups. (Sorry I have no phone at the moment or camera to show you.) But I'm curious about what it is. Does anyone know? its all matte black no other colors on the thing or the cable. It looks like a mouse a little bit but its definitely not. Especially after you flip it on the weird joint it has",

This buzzing sound also stops if a sound starts.\n\nThe interesting thing is, if a leave a tab on youtube playing a Humming sound on 1% volume (inaudible for me), then the buzzing sound never happens again.\n\nFor grounding issue, i tried connecting a usb-c/usb to a usb port on my laptop and touching the other end, and the buzzing sound happens anyway. Don't know if it was a proper grounding test though. There is no metal part in the case, as it is all plastic.\n\nAlso, the headset works fine, tested it on my phone, xbox, and my other pc.\n\nThe buzzing sound, weirdly enough, only happens one ear at a time, never both. Sometimes it buzz on the left ear, sometimes on the right, and the pitch varies too.",

I then installed \"PCAPdroid\", an app that let's me view all the traffic coming in and out of the phone. I saw traffic from an app called \"Mobile Services Manager\" sending requests to urls with download in their domain name. I promptly disabled this app. It's important to note that the two applications I saw install by themselves were both published by \"guru puzzle games\". Im nervous that I somehow have persistent malware that can stay on a phone, even after factory reset. \n\nI have attached a screenshot of the traffic I captured. The github requests are related to pcapdroid and the urls that say \"download-att\" are requests made my \"Mobile Services Manager\". \n\nPlease shed some light on this matter.

    "title": "My PC gets unresponsive ( Ctlr+Alt+Del helps for a while)",
    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nRecently I've came back from holiday and it seems for some odd reason my PC gets unresponsive every time it turns it on. Previously I had no issue whatsoever. I made few tests but it seems I've lost any further ideas what to do, so here are all potential useful information's what I've discovered:\n\n**In summary:**\n\n1. My PC gets partialy unresponsive:\n\nSo in this situation I can see that once my PC turns on I can still move the mouse, it highlights the icons and everything which shows that the PC works. I can left click on my desktop however I cannot select anything. The start taskbar does not work. I've believed this could have been the mouse issue as the keyboard fully works but it happens with other mouses too. What I mean is even though I cannot click anything if I press anything on my keyboard it all works. The windows taskbar does work if I press for instance Windows key. I have ended up using more key shortcuts along with tab button but that's not an answer to it.\n\nUpdate: While I posting this my whole windows is unresponsive again but I can still write here normally and if necessary I'm able to select a spelling corrections from dropdown.  Not sure if this is also important but I can see that while I write this post whenever there is my mouse cursor on this writing, it goes back to this part of writing as if I've clicked it that I want to write from there.\n\n2. Google Chrome:\n\nI can see this also often happens with google chrome but with other browsers. So if I use few tabs (like 1-4) after a minute the google chrome becomes unresponsive on clicking the tabs. I do have number of bookmarks on my tab and instead of the switching on to them, it sets them to another tab automatically. However it does not allow me to select any tabs.\n\n  \nAlso this is my assumption but I believe that the responsiveness happens often at the start of my pc and while my PC is on for a while it happens less often...but still happens. But I might be wrong.\n\n  \nNot sure if this is an important information too but I've been on Windows 11 Pro for some good few years. For number of months I haven't received any new windows updates as I had an information 'Get the newer version of Windows to stay up to date'. However recently I had an notification that I can update to version 23H2. I don't want to say it wrong if I didn't had those issues before this update. I haven't paid attention much back then. \n\n**I did number of things to try to fix this:**\n\n\\-Updated all potential drivers for system and other programs including graphic card. It seems I'm all up to date\n\n\\- I've tried to defrag my PC\n\n\\-I've tried to update my CPU from official intel website but they do tell me that I'm all up to date.\n\n\\-I've opened my PC case to see if there is any dust but it seems it's all good. During my gameplay I do have my GPU temp around 65-75c.\n\n\\-I do use wallpaper engine which I thought this could be the issue as once I've closed it down fully my PC was working but for small amount of time\n\n\\-CTRL + ALT + DEL = This is currently my only solution for my PC to be responsive again...however this is once again for small amount of time as the issue comes back. \n\n\n\n**Overall:**  \nI started to pay attention to this since yesterday as it became annoying for me. One thing I did notice that this doesn't affect me while I play any games or at least I wasn't affected yet (especially FPS games which require lot's of mouse to work around). But one thing I've tested is that if I play some FPS game and then I go back to click something  desktop (as I play in full screen window mode) it does become unresponsive sometimes (and once again I have to process C+A+D to fix this. So I do assume this is something my CPU or internal graphical card which is used for desktop? Perhaps there is something wrong in settings? While I write this now my PC uses 8-12% of CPU. I do plan to make a hard reset of my system at some point but firstly I wanted to ask your opinion what could be the issue and if I can fix it now other way around. \n\n  \nHere are my specs:\n\nWindows 11 Pro\n\nIntel Core i5-8600k\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GTX\n\nMb: Asus tuf B360-Plus Gaming\n\n24B DDR4 SDRAM\n\n\n\n",

You cannot open anything from the taskbar, you can't see it, you can see it in safe mode but not has no functionality at all. We have tried a variety of scripts, GPO settings, No GPO settings, varies user accounts but are unable to get the taskbar to reappear. We have checked system logs and nothing seems to show and issue. We have tried to update from 24h2 to 25h2 but this also does not resolve the issue.\n\nWe have to actually reimage machines with a 24h2 Windows 11 build to get the taskbar to reappear.

The company I'm dealing with is trash but it was my only option unfortunately \n\nI got this PC yesterday \n\ncan't attach an image so: \n\n# Acer Predator Orion 7000 Gaming Desktop, Intel Core Ultra 9, 128GB RAM, 2TB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, Windows 11 Home, DG.E4DEM.003 - Black\n\nand from the start I started having problems. the ports were not working even though the PC was on then I figured that one of the RAM sticks was lose. I fixed it and it started working with no problem. after an hour or so my PC froze and both my mouse and keyboard stopped working ( the ports stopped working again) and the screen turned black. the mouse and keyboard work when I plug them to the ports that are located on top the PC but not the ones behind for some reason but the freezing problem persists. I keep restarting my PC every time this happens\n\nIt's driving me mad cuz they already ruined my previous PC entirely hence them giving me this one for a discount from them (paid 3k US and yes I know I'm stupid) but now I can't even play my games in peace.\n\nI read somewhere that it could be a problem with the BIOS but I have no knowledge to what that is. I managed to access it but IDK what to do next or which version I should download mine is ver 1.05 now and there are ver. 1.06 and 1.07 should I download both or just the latest version??  thank you \n\n",

My room and my brother's room sandwich the router room (in fact, the router is towards the side of the wall that my pc is on), so we SHOULD be getting around the same speeds, both use wifi. He has around 500 Mbps, and I don't. I found that my wifi card could be problematic so I switched to a wifi 6 USB adapter, the Wavlink AX1800. It says I'm connected to 5ghz and my link speed is 1201mbps.  I turned off my first wifi card's wifi in settings, so I know my new wifi adapter is being read. Yet nothing changed at all regarding speed. I tried resetting wifi settings in cmd, but nothing changed. I cannot get an Ethernet as my landlord is strict about holes, staples, and loose wiring. I cannot use a powerline adapter as the circuits don't connect and it doesn't change, No coax so no MoCa. I lag in games and if I try to stream (even sometimes when my speedtest shows 90mbps download and 37 mbps upload). I don't know what to do and I just want to fix it. Any alternatives other than defying my landlord are appreciated. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I’ve got an **MSI Trident 3 Arctic (pre-built)** that’s been acting weird. A while ago it wouldn’t turn on properly,  it powered up but didn’t connect to any peripherals (no display, mouse, or keyboard). We cleaned the motherboard and CPU and it worked again for a bit.\n\nThen it started failing again, but if I **pressed down manually on the CPU cooler** (I know this sounds insane), it would boot and go into BIOS. I could even play games and stream again. Now even that trick doesn’t work  it powers on, fans spin, lights come on, but still no display or peripherals. The copper parts stay cool. Not sure if it’s the **cooler** or the **motherboard** at this point.\n\n**ChatGPT suggested the following possible causes:**  \n• CPU might not be seated right or has bent pins (pressing the cooler was fixing contact temporarily)  \n• Motherboard could have a micro-crack or bad solder joint near the CPU socket  \n• Cooler might be mounted unevenly, flexing the board  \n• Loose CPU power connector or bad PSU connection\n\n**And the following solutions (which we’ve already tried):**\n\n1. Unplug everything (already did that, wasn’t the cause)\n2. Remove cooler + CPU, inspect socket for bent pins or dirt (my brother found nothing)\n3. Clean off old thermal paste, reapply, and remount the cooler evenly (cross pattern) (did that)\n4. Double-check 24-pin and 8-pin power connectors\n5. Try booting with just CPU, one stick of RAM, and integrated GPU (already did that that wasn’t the cause)\n6. If still dead, test CPU or motherboard in another system (cant do that since I have no spare motherboard)\n\nSo what do you all think is going on? Is this more likely a **motherboard** or **cooler** issue? And does anyone know a **reputable PC repair shop in Brussels, Belgium**?",

I have had moments where I brush the keyboard and the problem is fixed. Issue is, I have no clue which keys I am accidentally pressing in combination to achieve this.\n\nI have tried Fn + Esc, Fn + Caps, Fn + A and others that have been suggested on other forums. I have checked in settings to no avail. I have checked keyboard properties in the control panel with no success. I am rather stumped as to what to do.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

Please install an app or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default App Settings page.\n\nI don’t know if this is relevant, but it also takes much longer to shut down or start up.\n\nI’ve tried restarting it, shutting it down, putting it in sleep mode (all via alt+f4, since I can’t access the start menu), unplugging it, and restarting file explorer from the task manager (something I saw as a solution to a similar problem). \n\nI’m honestly at a loss for what else to try.

However, they keep saying they can’t escalate to the internal team and that appeals aren’t available for me right now, which leaves me completely stuck.\n\nThis is starting to seriously impact my business (we’re heading into the busiest period of the year), and I can’t seem to get past the support loop.\n\nHas anyone managed to get around this or reach someone senior who can actually review the restriction?\nAny advice, contact routes, or escalation paths would be hugely appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nThomas\n",

It only happens on the emulator, when I play other games, everything is normal. Sometimes when the BSOD appears, sometimes it just freezes and I have to manually restart it.\n\nA year ago, when my PC was running at 3200MHz, all games would crash to the desktop, so I lowered it to 3000MHz, and now it runs smoothly without any crashes.\n\nThe issue seems to be specific to this emulator, even though my Windows was recently installed. The temperature is safe, and I have no idea what's causing this. I've tried other emulators, but the result is the same. Disabling DCP doesn't make a difference either.\n\nEDIT : It turns out that after I play a game (any game) when I open the emulator for a few seconds, I immediately get a blue screen. If I restart my PC and open the emulator, nothing will happen (I tested it for 3 hours, I don't know if it will crash after that).\n\nPC Specs:\n\nRyzen 5 5600X\n\n16GB 3200MHZ\n\nPSU DEEPCOOL PL650\n\nRTX 4070 SUPER\n\nMinidump :  \n[https://www.mediafire.com/file/j23mf0j96neb2d4/minidumps.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/j23mf0j96neb2d4/minidumps.zip/file)",

    "title": "5 year old unopened iPads won't charge. Is there any reasonable hope?",
    "selftext": "Back in 2020, we purchased about 100 iPads for one reason or another. I think something to do with Telehealth. Most of them were used and rolled out to the world, with no problems. \n\nNow it's late 2025, and we have about 20 iPads that we haven't taken out of the box yet. Of these, I believe so far we've found 6 iPads that refuse to turn on and stay on. \n\nWhen plugged into the stock charger (these are older gen 2 pro iPads, so they came with Apple Chargers), they will show the Apple logo for about 3-5 seconds, before it goes away, seemingly turning off, pausing for another 3-5 seconds, and showing the Apple logo again. Not my video, but it looks like this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U\\_wjIpfyXE8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U_wjIpfyXE8) but with a white logo on black background and a different model iPad\n\nSince I have so many brokenish iPads, my coworkers and I have been able to try a few things.   \nFirst, I tried overnight charging with the stock charger.   \nI tried overnight with a faster charger, which was a laptop charger.   \nI tried overnight with a slower charger, which is the USB port on my computer. \n\nThen I tried booting into recovery mode (I believe called DFU mode). I do this a lot, I'm familiar with how the process works.   \nWhen trying to use my desktop to do this, it isn't even getting enough power to show the little computer and plug symbols.   \nWhen trying to boot into recovery while plugged into the wall with the stock charger, it will show the symbol and it will stay on (more on that next), but obviously I can't restore the iPad if I'm plugged up to the wall.   \nNext I tried recovery mode from a laptop that has a thunderbolt port, which seems to have more power in the USB port than my desktop. This would briefly flip to showing the computer and plug symbol, before turning itself off and back on to the Apple symbol. \n\nThe laptop also had one of those ports with a battery+ symbol, but it seemed to power the iPad less than the Thunderbolt port.   \nI also had a powered dock, with the same battery+ symbol that behaved the same. \n\nSince the iPad will seemingly stay on for a few minutes when in recovery mode, I also tried leaving it there for a few minutes. Normal iPad behavior turns that off after a few minutes, and this does the same, putting it back in the bootloop. \n\n  \nWe believe the problem is that the iPad is so dead that it can't start the firmware needed to properly initiate charging. A potential solution to this would be a jumpstart, but not only would we not know how to do this, but it could be dangerous. The other solution would be to take the battery out, charge it externally, and put it back together. We have a lot of iPads that are broken, however, and no experience doing this. Assuming it's even possible. ",

But to be clear, i open it like 3 times for less than 2 mins to check if there are any damage after more than 24 hrs. And now few of the keys is still not working.is the keyboard short circuit? Should I clean the whole keyboard? Should i just change the whole laptop?",

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case. \n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well. \n\n\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**",

I tried changing it according to their instructions, but it ASKED FOR THE PIN TO CHANGE THE PIN.

I can't even get to the main menu on the tech support line, they just hang up, so I am going to have to try calling from a different phone number. I tried changing my password, I tried literally everything. It ended up locking after a certain point because I tried entering a PIN i might have created and I didn't get it right (which further proves that I didn't make it because I usually remember the numbers I use??) I cannot figure out this PIN situation and I can't think of anywhere else to go to get help. Literally the tech support won't even answer me. I am so frustrated and at my wits end. I'm literally crying right now because they hung up on me and all I want to do is play minecraft with the kids :,(",

On the back of the board, there are 3 golden like \"nipple\" looking connections and this accessory that was in the box, connects to those. and its asus brand. But... I don't know what it is. On the cable it says 15w33 like its some kind of wireless charger, but it looks like the top of a cybertruck, and it does have a joint. I can turn it and it can sit in a different way and it just looks like something you put on the desk that says \"asus\" as a decoration. But it can't just be that, because its connected to 3 hookups. (Sorry I have no phone at the moment or camera to show you.) But I'm curious about what it is. Does anyone know? its all matte black no other colors on the thing or the cable. It looks like a mouse a little bit but its definitely not. Especially after you flip it on the weird joint it has",

    "selftext": "So this morning, I factory reset my phone due to some issues I was having with it. I came back 1 hour later to it and I found that an app called \"Ball Puzzle Sort\" was installed and I didn't install it. I deleted the app and right after I deleted it, a new app called \"Water Puzzle Sort\" was installed. I then installed \"PCAPdroid\", an app that let's me view all the traffic coming in and out of the phone. I saw traffic from an app called \"Mobile Services Manager\" sending requests to urls with download in their domain name. I promptly disabled this app. It's important to note that the two applications I saw install by themselves were both published by \"guru puzzle games\". Im nervous that I somehow have persistent malware that can stay on a phone, even after factory reset. \n\nI have attached a screenshot of the traffic I captured. The github requests are related to pcapdroid and the urls that say \"download-att\" are requests made my \"Mobile Services Manager\". \n\nPlease shed some light on this matter. Has this happened to anyone else before? Do I have a RAT or malware (remember this is a freshly reset phone)? ",

    "title": "My PC gets unresponsive ( Ctlr+Alt+Del helps for a while)",
    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nRecently I've came back from holiday and it seems for some odd reason my PC gets unresponsive every time it turns it on. Previously I had no issue whatsoever. I made few tests but it seems I've lost any further ideas what to do, so here are all potential useful information's what I've discovered:\n\n**In summary:**\n\n1. My PC gets partialy unresponsive:\n\nSo in this situation I can see that once my PC turns on I can still move the mouse, it highlights the icons and everything which shows that the PC works. I can left click on my desktop however I cannot select anything. The start taskbar does not work. I've believed this could have been the mouse issue as the keyboard fully works but it happens with other mouses too. What I mean is even though I cannot click anything if I press anything on my keyboard it all works. The windows taskbar does work if I press for instance Windows key. I have ended up using more key shortcuts along with tab button but that's not an answer to it.\n\nUpdate: While I posting this my whole windows is unresponsive again but I can still write here normally and if necessary I'm able to select a spelling corrections from dropdown.  Not sure if this is also important but I can see that while I write this post whenever there is my mouse cursor on this writing, it goes back to this part of writing as if I've clicked it that I want to write from there.\n\n2. Google Chrome:\n\nI can see this also often happens with google chrome but with other browsers. So if I use few tabs (like 1-4) after a minute the google chrome becomes unresponsive on clicking the tabs. I do have number of bookmarks on my tab and instead of the switching on to them, it sets them to another tab automatically. However it does not allow me to select any tabs.\n\n  \nAlso this is my assumption but I believe that the responsiveness happens often at the start of my pc and while my PC is on for a while it happens less often...but still happens. But I might be wrong.\n\n  \nNot sure if this is an important information too but I've been on Windows 11 Pro for some good few years. For number of months I haven't received any new windows updates as I had an information 'Get the newer version of Windows to stay up to date'. However recently I had an notification that I can update to version 23H2. I don't want to say it wrong if I didn't had those issues before this update. I haven't paid attention much back then. \n\n**I did number of things to try to fix this:**\n\n\\-Updated all potential drivers for system and other programs including graphic card. It seems I'm all up to date\n\n\\- I've tried to defrag my PC\n\n\\-I've tried to update my CPU from official intel website but they do tell me that I'm all up to date.\n\n\\-I've opened my PC case to see if there is any dust but it seems it's all good. During my gameplay I do have my GPU temp around 65-75c.\n\n\\-I do use wallpaper engine which I thought this could be the issue as once I've closed it down fully my PC was working but for small amount of time\n\n\\-CTRL + ALT + DEL = This is currently my only solution for my PC to be responsive again...however this is once again for small amount of time as the issue comes back. \n\n\n\n**Overall:**  \nI started to pay attention to this since yesterday as it became annoying for me. One thing I did notice that this doesn't affect me while I play any games or at least I wasn't affected yet (especially FPS games which require lot's of mouse to work around). But one thing I've tested is that if I play some FPS game and then I go back to click something  desktop (as I play in full screen window mode) it does become unresponsive sometimes (and once again I have to process C+A+D to fix this. So I do assume this is something my CPU or internal graphical card which is used for desktop? Perhaps there is something wrong in settings? While I write this now my PC uses 8-12% of CPU. I do plan to make a hard reset of my system at some point but firstly I wanted to ask your opinion what could be the issue and if I can fix it now other way around. \n\n  \nHere are my specs:\n\nWindows 11 Pro\n\nIntel Core i5-8600k\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GTX\n\nMb: Asus tuf B360-Plus Gaming\n\n24B DDR4 SDRAM\n\n\n\n",

It may just be confined to our environment but willing to hear if anyone else has had similar.\n\nThe taskbar is essentially invisible, not hidden. You cannot open anything from the taskbar, you can't see it, you can see it in safe mode but not has no functionality at all. We have tried a variety of scripts, GPO settings, No GPO settings, varies user accounts but are unable to get the taskbar to reappear. We have checked system logs and nothing seems to show and issue.

    "selftext": "Back in 2020, we purchased about 100 iPads for one reason or another. I think something to do with Telehealth. Most of them were used and rolled out to the world, with no problems. \n\nNow it's late 2025, and we have about 20 iPads that we haven't taken out of the box yet. Of these, I believe so far we've found 6 iPads that refuse to turn on and stay on. \n\nWhen plugged into the stock charger (these are older gen 2 pro iPads, so they came with Apple Chargers), they will show the Apple logo for about 3-5 seconds, before it goes away, seemingly turning off, pausing for another 3-5 seconds, and showing the Apple logo again. Not my video, but it looks like this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U\\_wjIpfyXE8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U_wjIpfyXE8) but with a white logo on black background and a different model iPad\n\nSince I have so many brokenish iPads, my coworkers and I have been able to try a few things.   \nFirst, I tried overnight charging with the stock charger.   \nI tried overnight with a faster charger, which was a laptop charger.   \nI tried overnight with a slower charger, which is the USB port on my computer. \n\nThen I tried booting into recovery mode (I believe called DFU mode). I do this a lot, I'm familiar with how the process works.   \nWhen trying to use my desktop to do this, it isn't even getting enough power to show the little computer and plug symbols.   \nWhen trying to boot into recovery while plugged into the wall with the stock charger, it will show the symbol and it will stay on (more on that next), but obviously I can't restore the iPad if I'm plugged up to the wall.   \nNext I tried recovery mode from a laptop that has a thunderbolt port, which seems to have more power in the USB port than my desktop. This would briefly flip to showing the computer and plug symbol, before turning itself off and back on to the Apple symbol. \n\nThe laptop also had one of those ports with a battery+ symbol, but it seemed to power the iPad less than the Thunderbolt port.   \nI also had a powered dock, with the same battery+ symbol that behaved the same. \n\nSince the iPad will seemingly stay on for a few minutes when in recovery mode, I also tried leaving it there for a few minutes. Normal iPad behavior turns that off after a few minutes, and this does the same, putting it back in the bootloop. \n\n  \nWe believe the problem is that the iPad is so dead that it can't start the firmware needed to properly initiate charging. A potential solution to this would be a jumpstart, but not only would we not know how to do this, but it could be dangerous. The other solution would be to take the battery out, charge it externally, and put it back together. We have a lot of iPads that are broken, however, and no experience doing this. Assuming it's even possible. ",

    "title": "£6000 Custom-Built High-End PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) Underperforming — Seeking Advice",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or insight into ongoing performance issues with my custom-built PC. I had it built by a reputable company in **March 2024**, and although I have a decent general understanding of computers, I’m not confident when it comes to deeper technical stuff like tweaking voltages, overclocking, or manually adjusting CPU cores.\n\nI invested around **£6000** into this system with the goal of having a rig that could handle **any modern game at ultra/max settings** and high frame rates — ideally also being **future-proof for 4K gaming** down the line. I had a company build this for me and optimise the system in the hopes that I could just plug it in and play games at ultra settings without issue, but that hasn't been the case. \n\nCurrently, I’m running:\n\n* 3 monitors total (2x 1080p 60Hz + 1x 1440p 144Hz main monitor)\n* Main monitor via DisplayPort, other two via HDMI (one uses a HDMI → DP adapter)\n\n\n\n# Full Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D (Zen 4)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA ROG STRIX RTX 4090 24GB\n* **RAM:** 4x Kingston FURY DDR5 32GB 5600MHz (currently running 2 sticks at 5200MHz for testing)\n* **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix XT (360mm AIO)\n* **Case:** HYTE Y60 (Black)\n* **PSU:** Corsair HX1500i (1500W Platinum Modular)\n* **Storage:** WD Black SN850X 4TB NVMe SSD + WD Red Plus 14TB HDD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 Pro\n\n\n\n# Performance Issues:\n\nSince I got it, the system hasn’t been performing anywhere near what I’d expect for this hardware tier (unless I'm being naive). Even with background software and RGB programs closed, **most games struggle to maintain high or consistent FPS**.\n\nFor example, in **Battlefield 6**, with settings mostly on *High*, I get anywhere between **80–140 FPS**, constantly fluctuating with noticeable **frame spikes** and stutters. Although, this tends to be on the lower end, as do most other games. BF6 overlay show the **CPU frametimes spiking much more than GPU**, though GPU performance also seems underwhelming.\n\nOlder or less demanding games (e.g., Rocket League, League of Legends) run fine, but more modern or graphically demanding titles show big frame inconsistencies or low averages (I am getting 50–80 FPS on Ultra in GTA V, which feels way too low for this hardware). I have Rocket League settings all at the lowest for performance, but if I switch on all the settings at max, I still get frame spikes here as well. \n\n\n\n# RAM Notes:\n\nI’ve recently discovered that **running 4 sticks of RAM** can cause stability or performance issues compared to 2 sticks, but I'm not overly sure if this is correct.\n\n* With **4 sticks**, I can only reach **3600MHz stable**.\n* With **2 sticks**, I can run **5200MHz**, but anything higher fails to boot (black screen).\n\nPerformance *feels* slightly more consistent with 2 sticks installed, but FPS is lower. A friend mentioned my RAM might not be on the motherboard’s **QVL list** and that “compatible” RAM doesn’t always mean *optimal*.\n\nWould it be worth buying new RAM entirely, or is that unlikely to be the root cause here?\n\n\n\n# What I’ve Tried:\n\n* Updated **BIOS** and all **drivers** (GPU, chipset, Windows, etc.)\n* Tried both **High Performance** and **Balanced** Windows power plans (apparently 7950X3D prefers Balanced, so I tried changing to this yesterday, but everything still doesn't feel great)\n* Adjusted **NVIDIA Control Panel** and **Windows Graphics settings** to prioritize the 4090 and performance\n* Tested disabling unnecessary background software and lighting control programs, but issues occur despite this.\n* Checked performance on **UserBenchmark**, which consistently reports:\n   * CPU frequency *“very low”*\n   * RAM frequency below rated speeds\n   * System load higher than expected (even when idle)\n* Closed all overlays except **NVIDIA ShadowPlay**, which I’d ideally like to use for clips. However, I've tried turning this off in the past (although this was around a year ago), and I still had issues. I see other people using this all the time and they seem to be fine?\n\nDespite all this, I still see unstable FPS, frame drops, frame spiking and what looks like CPU underutilisation.\n\n\n\n# Questions / Advice Needed:\n\n* Am I **expecting too much** from this system, or should a 7950X3D + RTX 4090 genuinely be able to handle almost any game on ultra at high FPS (especially at 1440p)?\n* Could **RAM compatibility or configuration** be a major cause of these issues?\n* Is it worth learning about and adjusting **CCD/Core Parking or undervolting**, or could that make things worse without deep knowledge?\n* Any other ideas on how to **diagnose and fix** performance inconsistencies and CPU frame spikes?\n\nI just want to be able to play games on high settings with consistent performance and FPS, and I thought this sort of hardware should be able to do that. I've been on/off battling with this for 18 months I’m starting to feel a bit lost and disappointed given the investment, so any expert guidance would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* £6000 custom-built PC (7950X3D + RTX 4090) underperforming since day one\n* Games fluctuate heavily in FPS, experiencing frame loss/spiking/stuttering, even at low/mid settings\n* CPU frametimes spike often; GPU also underperforms from what I can see\n* 4 sticks of DDR5 only stable at 3600MHz, 2 sticks at 5200MHz — unsure if RAM config or compatibility is hurting performance\n* Tried updating BIOS/drivers/power plans/Windows settings — no real improvement\n* Looking for help figuring out if this is **normal**, **RAM-related**, or a **hardware/software config issue**",

I tried to log in multiple times over the last two weeks, but there were so many firewalls for my microsoft account. It asked for a pin that I don't ever remember creating?!?! I tried changing it according to their instructions, but it ASKED FOR THE PIN TO CHANGE THE PIN. I tried calling tech support and they immediately will hang up on me when I call after I mentioned that the issue was for signing in, I'm not joking. I can't even get to the main menu on the tech support line, they just hang up, so I am going to have to try calling from a different phone number. I tried changing my password, I tried literally everything. It ended up locking after a certain point because I tried entering a PIN i might have created and I didn't get it right (which further proves that I didn't make it because I usually remember the numbers I use??) I cannot figure out this PIN situation and I can't think of anywhere else to go to get help. Literally the tech support won't even answer me. I am so frustrated and at my wits end. I'm literally crying right now because they hung up on me and all I want to do is play minecraft with the kids :,(",

On the back of the board, there are 3 golden like \"nipple\" looking connections and this accessory that was in the box, connects to those. and its asus brand. But... I don't know what it is. On the cable it says 15w33 like its some kind of wireless charger, but it looks like the top of a cybertruck, and it does have a joint. I can turn it and it can sit in a different way and it just looks like something you put on the desk that says \"asus\" as a decoration. But it can't just be that, because its connected to 3 hookups. (Sorry I have no phone at the moment or camera to show you.) But I'm curious about what it is. Does anyone know? its all matte black no other colors on the thing or the cable. It looks like a mouse a little bit but its definitely not. Especially after you flip it on the weird joint it has",
