Right out of the box, inside the store, it wouldn’t connect to WiFi, it wouldn’t connect to 5G or LTE and it had to be connected via Ethernet. That phone had problems right out of the box and when we asked if we could get another phone that didn’t need to be connected via Ethernet for set up (while my mom had her iPhone 13 Pro out of the box set up beautifully with no extra support needed, they refused). \n\nJust now I got an Apple Pencil. Brand new. Off the Apple Store App. Engraved. And it only HALF works. It can click stuff. That’s it. It will not draw. \n\nOn procreate, the eraser works, smudge and paint don’t. On ArtStudio pro, nothing works. And on the iOS notes app, it draws. It was als\n\nMy really cheap $30 off brand “Apple” pencil works beautiful for everything though. \n\nI’ve reset the iPad, the pencil (forget this device), I’ve swapped out the Apple Pencil tips (official ones, even the bootleg one has an official tip on it) and it doesn’t work. \n\nIt wasn’t closed all the way (the tip) and won’t close all the way. I’m going to take this pencil into the Apple Store and ask for one that’s actually new or a refund if they give me another busted pencil. \n\nI might as well have bought three bootleg pencils and I’d have saved money and wouldn’t have products that actually work. \n",

    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "title": "I'm a doctor and built a responsive breathing app for anxiety and sleep. It's now App of the Day!! (75% off lifetime to celebrate)",
    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

Brand new. Off the Apple Store App. Engraved. And it only HALF works. It can click stuff. That’s it. It will not draw. \n\nOn procreate, the eraser works, smudge and paint don’t. On ArtStudio pro, nothing works. And on the iOS notes app, it draws. It was als\n\nMy really cheap $30 off brand “Apple” pencil works beautiful for everything though. \n\nI’ve reset the iPad, the pencil (forget this device), I’ve swapped out the Apple Pencil tips (official ones, even the bootleg one has an official tip on it) and it doesn’t work. \n\nIt wasn’t closed all the way (the tip) and won’t close all the way. I’m going to take this pencil into the Apple Store and ask for one that’s actually new or a refund if they give me another busted pencil. \n\nI might as well have bought three bootleg pencils and I’d have saved money and wouldn’t have products that actually work. \n",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

Full battery and low battery. There has been no recurrent theme that I can think of would cause this. Do I need to replace anything or go to Apple?

Le même décalage se produit lors du verrouillage du téléphone.\n\nLe second problème concerne l’autonomie de la batterie, qui diminue très rapidement. Je sais que de nombreux utilisateurs d’iOS 26 rencontrent le même souci, mais cela me paraît anormal. Je pense d’ailleurs que ces deux problèmes sont liés.\n\nC’est comme si quelque chose tournait en arrière-plan en permanence et créait cette latence.\n\nJ’ai déjà désactivé l’actualisation des applications en arrière-plan et demandé un diagnostic à Apple, qui n’a détecté aucune anomalie.\n\nEst-ce que quelqu’un a déjà rencontré ce cas ou saurait d’où cela peut venir svp ?\n\nMerci pour votre aide.",

I understand that it is \"normal\" for an iPhone to run warm at certain times, but mine seems to do so more often than not, and gets pretty hot to the touch even. This will happen when it's charging, even though I'm not actively using it simultaneously, or just basic use: texting, web browsing, etc really warms it up and quickly, regardless of environmental temp. I don't play intensive games with high graphics that would put strain on the phone - heat from that would make sense. I did notice, after updating to iOS 26, that it got warm/hot at a faster pace and more often. Which I know is common for a few days after an update because the phone is doing a lot of background internal work but that was weeks ago, it should've normalized by now, right? I have background app refresh off, dark mode enabled, very low screen brightness, no widgets, soft restart... I'm nervous that the heat is going to harm some of the \"internal workings\" - I can't imagine this is a problem unique to me. Has anyone figured out a fix or some tips to help this issue?

But I’m not comfortable with that because it will affect water resistance. What is the best option? I will be in the US only in Dec mid. \n\nThe smudge/grey spot is minute and doesn’t really affect pics but I know it now and it’s bothering. Not expected from apple. \n\nOptions: \n1.

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

    "selftext": "In August of 2025 I got a new iPhone 15 Pro (256 GB), the circumstances were such that I wasn't able to wait for the 16, so it is only slightly over a year old. I understand that it is \"normal\" for an iPhone to run warm at certain times, but mine seems to do so more often than not, and gets pretty hot to the touch even. This will happen when it's charging, even though I'm not actively using it simultaneously, or just basic use: texting, web browsing, etc really warms it up and quickly, regardless of environmental temp. I don't play intensive games with high graphics that would put strain on the phone - heat from that would make sense. I did notice, after updating to iOS 26, that it got warm/hot at a faster pace and more often. Which I know is common for a few days after an update because the phone is doing a lot of background internal work but that was weeks ago, it should've normalized by now, right? I have background app refresh off, dark mode enabled, very low screen brightness, no widgets, soft restart... I'm nervous that the heat is going to harm some of the \"internal workings\" - I can't imagine this is a problem unique to me. Has anyone figured out a fix or some tips to help this issue?

I do not have the receipt as it was in his card. So am I right then in thinking that if I purchase the applecare with theft and loss coverage and got the phone stolen they will most likely won’t replace it as I do not have the purchase proof?

Le même décalage se produit lors du verrouillage du téléphone.\n\nLe second problème concerne l’autonomie de la batterie, qui diminue très rapidement. Je sais que de nombreux utilisateurs d’iOS 26 rencontrent le même souci, mais cela me paraît anormal. Je pense d’ailleurs que ces deux problèmes sont liés.\n\nC’est comme si quelque chose tournait en arrière-plan en permanence et créait cette latence.\n\nJ’ai déjà désactivé l’actualisation des applications en arrière-plan et demandé un diagnostic à Apple, qui n’a détecté aucune anomalie.\n\nEst-ce que quelqu’un a déjà rencontré ce cas ou saurait d’où cela peut venir svp ?\n\nMerci pour votre aide.",

    "selftext": "In August of 2025 I got a new iPhone 15 Pro (256 GB), the circumstances were such that I wasn't able to wait for the 16, so it is only slightly over a year old. I understand that it is \"normal\" for an iPhone to run warm at certain times, but mine seems to do so more often than not, and gets pretty hot to the touch even. This will happen when it's charging, even though I'm not actively using it simultaneously, or just basic use: texting, web browsing, etc really warms it up and quickly, regardless of environmental temp. I don't play intensive games with high graphics that would put strain on the phone - heat from that would make sense. I did notice, after updating to iOS 26, that it got warm/hot at a faster pace and more often. Which I know is common for a few days after an update because the phone is doing a lot of background internal work but that was weeks ago, it should've normalized by now, right? I have background app refresh off, dark mode enabled, very low screen brightness, no widgets, soft restart... I'm nervous that the heat is going to harm some of the \"internal workings\" - I can't imagine this is a problem unique to me. Has anyone figured out a fix or some tips to help this issue?

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

No ads. No tracking.\n\nCore features are:\n\n* 📥 **Save Anything** — links, TikToks, YouTube videos, and articles.\n* 📑 **Folders & Tags** — organize everything in a clean, minimal interface.\n* 🔗 **Multi-Paste URLs** — save multiple links at once.\n* ☁️ **Cloud Sync & Backup** — your data stays safe and accessible.\n* 🔍 **Smart Search** — find anything you’ve saved instantly.\n* 📤 **Import/Export** — move your bookmarks from browsers or other apps.\n* ⚡ **Offline Support** (coming soon).\n\nIt’s completely free to try, and even the paid plans are much cheaper than others.  \nNo hidden fees, no data selling, no tracking.\n\nWould love your feedback — especially if you’re into productivity tools or use bookmarking apps!\n\n👉 Google Play: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saveitlater.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saveitlater.app)  \n\n👉 App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/save-it-later/id6752220740](https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/save-it-later/id6752220740)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

That's why I would never buy a pixel in Japan.\n\nAnd I will be in Japan in December for a big vacation, now looks like just to avoid the possible nightmare scenario, I would have to either use expensive data or rent a portable wifi, jeez, I was enjoying the esim experience so much last week in Barcelona and was really looking forward to use it in Japan😭",

I’ve had iPhone for a long time (don’t judge!) because I really wasn’t a fan of the Galaxy phones and I grew up in Silicon Valley in an area that was using Apple products since I was in elementary school. I know, I know, they’re not the only androids out there, as my friend has told me. Anyway, I started my family and got iPads and am pretty Apple integrated. A lot of accessories are readily available for iPhone like cases and screen protectors. But I’ve been thinking about maybe switching to the Pixel because I love Google. I’ve been using Chrome since forever. I always hated Safari and only used Firefox briefly - once Chrome came out, I never went back. So how many pixel users are out there? I see almost everyone and their mother use iPhones. I love iMessage but now there’s RCS. I have an Apple Watch 11 but the battery life is still meh after all these years. Anyway, thanks for any feedback in advance! ",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI recently replaced the battery for my Pixel 5. After the replacement I noticed the in-ear speaker wasn't working anymore as someone called me. \n\nWhat happens is: the screen goes blank when the phone tries to use the in-ear speaker and I have to touch the screen again to use it. When I switch on the bottom speaker that one works, switching to bluetooth headset works as well. If I switch back to in-ear speaker, the screen goes blank again.  \nIt looks like the phone tries to switch but then bugs, like it doesn't find the in-ear speaker?\n\nA few weeks after I replaced the battery I replaced the screen as well as it was damaged anyway. I thought it would fix the in-ear speaker since a brand new ear speaker came attached to it (it's attached on the back).   \nI replaced the screen succesfully but I still have the same issue.\n\n  \nSince the issue appeared after a maintenance I guess I did something wrong and might have disconnected something, or worse, damaged something.  \nI read on a forum:\n\n\n\n>\"I noticed that the 2 contact leads of the speaker are very close to each other, so precise alignment when placing it back to the new LCD is very important. It was erratic, worked on and off after reboot or after pressing the screen where the speaker is located underneath (5 o'clock of the front camera). I think vibrations from sound and gentle knocking may cause the 2 leads to be out of alignment.  \nI solved the issue after reopening the screen and did some realignment.\"\n\n  \nWhile replacing the screen I checked the two connectors and they looked fine, so idk. On a teardown video I saw there is a connector underneath a protection that I had to remove to replace the battery, so maybe I made a mistake there?\n\nI would like to know if any of you have met the same issue and if there are additional, software side things I can try before I open the phone again (which I diligently sealed with glue so I'd have to use the heatgun again and clean etc. while trying not to damage the very fragile screen, which is slightly annoying)\n\n  \nThank you so much :)",

A better looking 3.5x zoom photo:\n\nIf you miss the 3.5x zoom perspective for human portrait shots, zoom over the 5X slider until the tele lens kicks-in and drag the slider slowly back to 3.5X and then click the shutter. This will process an image which has the details from the 5X lens fusioned with the Main lens's digital crop. The resulting picture is highly usable if the subject in the frame is one or two people. You can also use Google photos to apply the blur which creates a decent potrait image.\n\n2. A better zoom lens transition in video:\n\nIf you want a better zoom transition/switch between the lenses, just before hitting the video record button try to zoom in and zoom out of the 5x lens manually for a few times. By doing so you will observe that the transition to the 5X lens becomes a bit faster than the usual. Once you feel it, you can hit on the recorder button and then zoom in.\n\nIdeally Google should make these stuff available by default but i am glad that they are present at least. ",

    "selftext": "Got both a 10Pro and a 10Pro XL, and the difference in one hand usability of the two phones is staggering. When you put one phone on top of another, it doesn't feel like much of a difference, but as soon as you use the phone one handed, the difference is night and day.\n\nUsing the XL without a case seems ok, but even then it's huge if you put it in your jean front pocket. And with the no-grip polished rails, it's a little scary.\n\nThe smaller 10Pro is the way to go for actual use on the go. Maybe I am biased since I am coming from a Galaxy S22, which is so svelte - compact and \\~160grams.\n\nIt's also crazy that Google charges $100 extra for the XL. (256 vs 256) For slightly faster charging and nothing else ? (it has lower PPI on the screen. The larger battery is mainly for the bigger screen.)\n\nEdit1: After doing some more comparison, the speaker on the XL is noticeably better. I watched teardowns of both, and both seem to be using the same bottom speakers, so it's not clear to me why the XL sounds better.\n\nEdit2: XL without case and 10Pro with case (clear spigen) are roughly the same dimension and even weight. Slightly less thick, but very slightly wide and very slightly taller.\n\n  \nFor the pixel 11Pro XL, if they can shave 1mm of bezel on all 4 edges, and put a physically smaller battery, (either Si-C, or more power efficient SoC) they could also reduce the thickness.  It's possible that, those things in combination can make the phone more one-hand use and pocket friendly.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\nI have the Pixel 10 Pro XL and this my very first Pixel phone. \n\nI ordered a case for my phone end of August from Amazon. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0FD3QCMQX?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_Y85KPDBHTP405F7G7MYG&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_Y85KPDBHTP405F7G7MYG&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_Y85KPDBHTP405F7G7MYG\n\n\ngot the phone and before touching the screen with my fingers I installed the screen protector that came with the case with no issues no bubbles and no dust.\n\nWithin a few weeks I notice a small bubble very close towards the top right edge of the screen and 24 hours after noticing the bubble I notice another bubble appeared on the right far edge about 2\" from the top.\n\nWithin hours the 2 spots connected and the top right of my screen protector seemed to have a gap.\n\nBlaming it on a bad install that I didn't notice I ordered a new screen protector on October 8th:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0FPQDFRQB?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_X7EMNNXSNC52HJ1PZJSP&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_X7EMNNXSNC52HJ1PZJSP&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_X7EMNNXSNC52HJ1PZJSP\n\nCame as a 2 pack and I by paying to much attention to the top right corner to not have a repeat I messed up the first install but nailed the second one perfectly and made sure it was a perfect install. \n\nSure enough within 2 weeks the same thing happened... bubble on the top right side and then another on right far side and then they connected and made a gap between glass and protector in the same area separating that corner.\n\nOrdered another screen protector on October 20th\n\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0FKBL85Y3?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_T20A2TESA5NN6KQP6X51&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_T20A2TESA5NN6KQP6X51&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_T20A2TESA5NN6KQP6X51&badgeInsights=insights\n\nand installed it and left my phone with no case just in case my case was putting pressure on the corner and having some sort of impact and I have been checking the phone everytimen I use it to see if any bubble forms. \n\nOf course this morning (9 days later) I check and the first bubble has formed and tonight the exact same gap pattern has appeared. \n\nAt this point it can't be how I'm installing the screen protector and the only thing I can think of is that the phone is warped/bent in that corner and that's what's causing this.\n\nIf you look at the picture this is how it is at the time of this post and it will just keep working itself down the right side and grow approximatly another 2\". The lifted pattern is exactly the same everytime and I can't see it being anything else.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/z5ZM4S7Dd3EqmGiH9\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue?\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "The last month or two I have noticed that Gemini Live isn't using the voice I've selected in the options, nor will it use any of them that I select. Instead it's using what it refers to as \"Aurora\" which is a \"default British female\" the issue is, it sounds condescending and rude constantly and the cadence and tone it uses is practically sarcastic and abrasive. The voice (Ursa in my case) still works when you just ask a normal question by holding the power button on the Pixel phone, but in \"Live\" mode it's this new voice and I couldn't hate it any more than do now. Switching to a male voice doesn't fix the issue either, you end up with whoever you pick in the version of Gemini you summon with a button, but the live version is \"default British male\" same abrasive tone and same condescending speech. I don't know if this is a big, or Google us doing some social experiment, but can someone please help me fix this, genuinely finding it completely unusable currently and I've searched online for an answer already but I haven't found any solution or even an acknowledgement from Google that they're aware of the issue, but others do seem to have this issue too.",

The default behavior for that setting is to hide all lock screen notifications after they initially pop-up since it expects you to basically unlock your phone any time you pick it up to use it so you'd have no real use for previews on the lock screen.\n\nPixel 9 Pro here running Android 16..\n\nI'm not sure if I'm the only person here having this issue or what but its slowly driving me a bit crazy lately.\n\nHow do I view my notifications on my lockscreen?\n\nis the only way to pull down the notification shade and view them in there?  When a notification FIRST comes in, I'm able to view and expand it on my lockscreen , but after that it seems that there's no way to expand that little row of app icons that appears on the lockscreen other than dragging down from the top and having the notification shade come down in the most janky way possible (half the time it just disappears as I'm dragging it down) .\n\nI feel like I'm doing something wrong here but I have no idea what.

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced the same issue.\n\nI've been a Pixel user since the good old days of the Pixel 3 XL, and the phone was working fine most of the time. The next Pixel I got was the Pixel 8 Pro, then the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and now I've got my shiny new Pixel 10 Pro XL.\n\nI will have to go on business trips to Chinese Mainland from time to time. Actually I am here for the Canton Fair right now.\n\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nThe phone has VoLTE and VoNR support in Hong Kong SAR with a local SIM from 3HK or roaming with my TWM SIM.\n\nPixels can connect to LTE for Internet access, but without VoLTE and VoNR support in Chinese Mainland with both my local SIMs from China Mobile and China Telecom.\n\nInterestingly, my Galaxy works well here and has NR SA connected with VoNR support when a local SIM was inserted.\n\n\nI reached Google Support in November last year and kept sending them bug reports until February this year, only to get an answer that was kind of like \"thanks for notifying us.\"\n\nAlso, I have posted to the Pixel Community about this frustrating issue, and they said that they can offer nothing since Google doesn't monitor the community.\n\nHas anyone else got the same issue? Pixel phones are really nice, and I wish I could use them everywhere rather than swapping my SIMs with my Galaxy frequently on business trips.",

I can use my cameras freely in the camera app itself, but any social media or chat app with a camera freezes if my eye gets too close to the front camera. This doesn't even make sense?? Why the eye? If I try to take a picture of my nose really close, the picture will not freeze. It will also not freeze if I try to put any other object near the front camera. Only eye or eyes up close make it freeze/crash. I tried this on a picture of a human on a maganize, and it didn't work even though I put the camera really close to the person's face. It only works if it's my face/eye, doesn't work on flat pictures.\n\nI tried updating my phone, the camera app, the social media apps, I restarted my phone many times, cleared cache, everything.

    "title": "Some games aren't working on a brand new P7 Pro. + My weeklong journey with the Pixel so far.",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: Got a brand-new and (until yesterday) factory sealed Pixel 7 Pro, three games either hang or crash immediately, despite working fine on my previous Pixel. Everything else on the phone runs perfectly afaik.\n\nEdit: I didn't really want to go through the hassle of a factory reset it DID seem to just fix these issues for me. OSRS and NIKKE both launch and run just fine now. Unlike the first time I didn't import any data from my old phone or restore any backups.\n\nThis is mostly me asking for help but I've had a bit of a journey over the last week and I might ramble a little bit before I get to my actual issue. I'm a week and two devices into my journey with the Pixel 7 Pro now, easily the most expensive phone I've ever owned and huge upgrade from my old Galaxy A50.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago I bought an 'acceptable quality' refurbished Pixel 7 Pro on Amazon for £210. It arrived last Wednesday and despite a slight bit of cosmetic damage and a few minor scratches on the screen that weren't even visible when the screen was on was fairly chuffed with it, I'd spent a bit of time playing around with it's camera and all the other little features that came with it, and got to setting everything up until barely 3 hours after swiching it on when it suddenly just switched itself off at around  what should've been 65%-70% battery and refused to turn back on again, only when plugged into the wall would it power on but after barely a second on the splash screen it would immediately shut off again and just keep bootlopping from there i did manage to get into the bootloader/fastboot menu but no further from there.\n\nAbout a day later it just suddenly started working again, and I'd managed (with some power button/volume spamming, I don't even remember how) to get it into some 'no command' screen and then into android itself. I had already contacted the seller yesterday to tell them it had suddenly stopped functioning so I messaged again to update them, of course my issues didn't stop there, at random points it would once again just turn off, though unlike the first time I was able to just turn it back on again. I was incredibly suspicious of the reseller anyway as they included an M360 diagnostic report that [showed 100% battery health despite their own diagnostic report showing it had been through 1050 battery cycle](https://imgur.com/a/czQaFiS)s.\n\nBy Saturday evening I'd had enough after it did it TWICE in the span of 20 minutes at work so I got home, factory wiped it and informed the seller of my intent to return it and went shopping around for another phone, I did 'really' like the Pixel 7 from the bit of time I had with it so I went around looking at the newer Pixels and on Monday I found an Ebay listing for a brand new and sealed Pixel 7 Pro for only £300 so instead I dived on that. \n\n\nIt arrived yesterday and after and after confirming it was indeed brand new and factory sealed, I let it charge to full for a few hours since it was entirely dead before switching it on for the first time, spent a bit of time getting everything setup again and updating the firmware from it's factory version of Android 13 to 16, great, everything working, I'm quite happy until try to launch a couple of the games to get them setup and properly downloaded.\n\n\n\n\n**Now my ACTUAL issue.**\n\nThree of the four games I usually have installed: Old School Runescape, Nikke and Rome Total War, all of which worked on the previous refurbed Pixel refuse to work on the new one. I'm fairly certain it's not the games themselves and I don't have a clue on why it would be the phone itself. The new phone has been fully updated and as far as I'm aware were/are both on the 1st October patch that the one I returned was on.\n\nI don't generally game on mobile so the game I do play are usually just ones I play on PC anyway and have cross-progression. If only one of them was having issues I'd just brush it off but three of the four I tested is a bit more worrisome.\n\n\n**Old School Runescape:** Will either hang on a black screen when launched before popping up a 'not responding' error or it'll simply show the app icon on said black screen and nothing more.\n\n**NIKKE:** Will get to it's load screen but stop loading at step 5/7 at exactly 57% won't progress any further.\n\n**Rome Total War:** Will launch but on the screen where it requires you to acknowledge it needs a periodic internet connection to work, tapping accept will force-close/crash the game back to homescreen.\n\n\n**Umamusume** on the other hand DOES work, I was able to get that working just fine, as far as the game's lobby screen without any issues.\n\n\nAnyone having any similar issues, problems or any possible fixes? I've tried the usual troubleshooting steps, reinstalling the apps, clearing cache/data for both the games and Google Play services, rebooting the phone but zero luck so far. Short of a factory wipe and doing all the setup again I'm not entirely certain where to go from here. I did a bit of Googling and found that last months Android update *might* be causing issues for some people across multiple different Pixel models.",

    "selftext": "If you own a Pixel phones that have 5X tele-lens you can follow the below tricks. \n\n1. A better looking 3.5x zoom photo:\n\nIf you miss the 3.5x zoom perspective for human portrait shots, zoom over the 5X slider until the tele lens kicks-in and drag the slider slowly back to 3.5X and then click the shutter. This will process an image which has the details from the 5X lens fusioned with the Main lens's digital crop. The resulting picture is highly usable if the subject in the frame is one or two people. You can also use Google photos to apply the blur which creates a decent potrait image.\n\n2. A better zoom lens transition in video:\n\nIf you want a better zoom transition/switch between the lenses, just before hitting the video record button try to zoom in and zoom out of the 5x lens manually for a few times. By doing so you will observe that the transition to the 5X lens becomes a bit faster than the usual. Once you feel it, you can hit on the recorder button and then zoom in.\n\nIdeally Google should make these stuff available by default but i am glad that they are present at least. ",

That's why I would never buy a pixel in Japan.\n\nAnd I will be in Japan in December for a big vacation, now looks like just to avoid the possible nightmare scenario, I would have to either use expensive data or rent a portable wifi, jeez, I was enjoying the esim experience so much last week in Barcelona and was really looking forward to use it in Japan😭",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI recently replaced the battery for my Pixel 5. After the replacement I noticed the in-ear speaker wasn't working anymore as someone called me. \n\nWhat happens is: the screen goes blank when the phone tries to use the in-ear speaker and I have to touch the screen again to use it. When I switch on the bottom speaker that one works, switching to bluetooth headset works as well. If I switch back to in-ear speaker, the screen goes blank again.  \nIt looks like the phone tries to switch but then bugs, like it doesn't find the in-ear speaker?\n\nA few weeks after I replaced the battery I replaced the screen as well as it was damaged anyway. I thought it would fix the in-ear speaker since a brand new ear speaker came attached to it (it's attached on the back).   \nI replaced the screen succesfully but I still have the same issue.\n\n  \nSince the issue appeared after a maintenance I guess I did something wrong and might have disconnected something, or worse, damaged something.  \nI read on a forum:\n\n\n\n>\"I noticed that the 2 contact leads of the speaker are very close to each other, so precise alignment when placing it back to the new LCD is very important. It was erratic, worked on and off after reboot or after pressing the screen where the speaker is located underneath (5 o'clock of the front camera). I think vibrations from sound and gentle knocking may cause the 2 leads to be out of alignment.  \nI solved the issue after reopening the screen and did some realignment.\"\n\n  \nWhile replacing the screen I checked the two connectors and they looked fine, so idk. On a teardown video I saw there is a connector underneath a protection that I had to remove to replace the battery, so maybe I made a mistake there?\n\nI would like to know if any of you have met the same issue and if there are additional, software side things I can try before I open the phone again (which I diligently sealed with glue so I'd have to use the heatgun again and clean etc. while trying not to damage the very fragile screen, which is slightly annoying)\n\n  \nThank you so much :)",

I know, I know, they’re not the only androids out there, as my friend has told me. Anyway, I started my family and got iPads and am pretty Apple integrated. A lot of accessories are readily available for iPhone like cases and screen protectors. But I’ve been thinking about maybe switching to the Pixel because I love Google. I’ve been using Chrome since forever. I always hated Safari and only used Firefox briefly - once Chrome came out, I never went back. So how many pixel users are out there? I see almost everyone and their mother use iPhones. I love iMessage but now there’s RCS. I have an Apple Watch 11 but the battery life is still meh after all these years.

    "selftext": "If you own a Pixel phones that have 5X tele-lens you can follow the below tricks. \n\n1. A better looking 3.5x zoom photo:\n\nIf you miss the 3.5x zoom perspective for human portrait shots, zoom over the 5X slider until the tele lens kicks-in and drag the slider slowly back to 3.5X and then click the shutter. This will process an image which has the details from the 5X lens fusioned with the Main lens's digital crop. The resulting picture is highly usable if the subject in the frame is one or two people. You can also use Google photos to apply the blur which creates a decent potrait image.\n\n2. A better zoom lens transition in video:\n\nIf you want a better zoom transition/switch between the lenses, just before hitting the video record button try to zoom in and zoom out of the 5x lens manually for a few times. By doing so you will observe that the transition to the 5X lens becomes a bit faster than the usual. Once you feel it, you can hit on the recorder button and then zoom in.\n\nIdeally Google should make these stuff available by default but i am glad that they are present at least. ",

That's why I would never buy a pixel in Japan.\n\nAnd I will be in Japan in December for a big vacation, now looks like just to avoid the possible nightmare scenario, I would have to either use expensive data or rent a portable wifi, jeez, I was enjoying the esim experience so much last week in Barcelona and was really looking forward to use it in Japan😭",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

I preordered the Z Flip 7 the 20th of july, while there was the promotion of the free galaxy buds pro 3 while giving my Z Flip 6 for trade in, so i ended up paying around 380€ for the phone, earbuds and galaxy Watch 8 Classic.\n\nIt's been a month and a half, the site said it would've been sent by the 4th of August but still my order is \"pending\" on their site with no update since they got my money on july 20th. I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?)

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use?

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

On the watch8 the home button and back button have swapped, which has been caused in a bit of issues, which I'm unable to fix because I can't figure out a way to swap them back to how it was on the old watch. I've been waking up two alarms and trying to turn them off through muscle memory while I'm asleep, which in turn leads to me accidentally dialing emergency services at 6:00 a.m. when I'm just trying to wake up. This is happening maybe at least once a week if not more. Is there a way to either swap the buttons so I don't accidentally dial 911 every morning as a wake-up call, or is there to swap the function of the back button and the home button press?",

    "selftext": "[Edit] Folks without kids. This post isn't for you. \nBut if you weren't aware: The Galaxy 8 is marketed to parents as an alternative to the Apple watch for a standalone connected device alternative to a cell phone. \nSearch  \"Galaxy Watch for Kids\" to find their page and the information they are advertising to parents.\n\nEVERY PART of getting Samsung Galaxy watches for our 2 kids as alternatives to cell phones had been one enormous trial after another. \nIt took days to get them set up and working on Verizon. BTW you cannot set up kids mode without a Samsung phone... And even then the process sucks. \nThe connectivity has been spotty AF, even outside and we live in Northern Chicago area with excellent coverage. \nThe last straw was when the 8yo accidentally left their watch at school but wasn't sure exactly when/where it might be. And the Find Hub placed it repeatedly at a coffee shop over a mile away. Leading us to believe it has been taken away from school by another child (not necessarily theft per semester). \n\nIt turned out to have stayed at school. \n\nLocation tracking that repeatedly updates to a place over a mile away is not acceptable for something explicitly intended to help parents have a modicum of ability to know where their kids might be in the event of an urgent situation or simply to check  in on their travels on public transit. \n\n[Edit] and it wouldn't be acceptable for an adult away from their phone either.

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

However, upon seeing it in person, I thought it was too bulky for me and my usage profile.\n\nSo even if the design is less attractive (for me obviously), I'm now considering Watch 8 (non LTE version). But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

Watch faces still appear when searched and can be downloaded, but no apps. I looked online, saw a tip to restart both devices, which I did to no help. Then another tip to factory reset the watch and connect it again, which again I did and it didn't help. I understand the watch is old but its worked absolutely fine connected to my old A54, so what changed?

The only change I can think of is being totally dissatisfied with Samsung Health exporting data I've limited what it exports, but it's still exporting heart rate 24/7, and I think that gets sent to the phone even without using Samsung Health at all.\n\nHave others notice similar significant changes in battery drain?\n\nEdit:  I should have knocked wood after posting.

    "selftext": "Input data:   \nWatch – Galaxy Watch 7   \nPhone – Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro   \n  \nFirst of all, the reason I decided to reset my watch was that my phone wasn’t syncing daily activity data with the Samsung Health app. In addition, when I tried to use the “Find your phone” feature, the watch displayed a “Couldn’t connect to your phone” (or something similar) error pop-up, even though it was properly paired with my Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro. It felt like the watch was paired with my phone, but not actually connected. After I reset the watch, I successfully paired it with my phone again, but the message “Check your phone to complete setup” keeps lingering. When I try to add the device in the Galaxy Wearable app, it’s successfully detected and added, but the connection process takes an indefinitely long time, and eventually, the message “Couldn’t connect to your watch” appears. Interestingly, the Bluetooth connection between the phone and the watch gets disconnected automatically afterwards. I have no idea what to do next.   \n  \nHas anyone encountered something similar? If so, how did you solve it? Honestly, I’m getting pretty desperate…",

On the watch8 the home button and back button have swapped, which has been caused in a bit of issues, which I'm unable to fix because I can't figure out a way to swap them back to how it was on the old watch. I've been waking up two alarms and trying to turn them off through muscle memory while I'm asleep, which in turn leads to me accidentally dialing emergency services at 6:00 a.m. when I'm just trying to wake up. This is happening maybe at least once a week if not more. Is there a way to either swap the buttons so I don't accidentally dial 911 every morning as a wake-up call, or is there to swap the function of the back button and the home button press?",

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

    "selftext": "Hey guys! Figured yall would know best. \n\nDetails: I had a Watch 4 Classic that I would spin the bezel pretty regularly like a fidget. I'd spin it with 1 finger, that's important. I had to get a new watch because something shredded under my bezel and everytime I'd spin it, something black or clear would work it's way from under the bezel. I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

However, upon seeing it in person, I thought it was too bulky for me and my usage profile.\n\nSo even if the design is less attractive (for me obviously), I'm now considering Watch 8 (non LTE version). But I'm not reading very good things about the battery.\n\nI am mostly interested in health (ecg, sleep) and sports (mainly pool and open water swimming and running, 4-5 times a week) tracking. I already have had several smart watches and never used calling/messaging etc and never used AOD.\n\nMy question is, is there someone out there using the watch like this, more like a Garmin let's say (which I don't consider as an option because I don't like the designs and they're way more expensive here than W8)? What kind of battery life can I expect?\n\nAs I'm using a Huawei, which I charge like every 10 days or so I guess, charging daily would be a nightmare!\n\nThanks in advance..",

To make things worse, the service center is asking ₹50,000 for the motherboard replacement, which is almost the cost of purchasing a new laptop. I’m really not sure what to do in this situation.

    "selftext": "Hi all, I've been searching for a new laptop, as my Asus Vivobook (i know) has finally decided to kick the bucket. The laptop wouldn't be my primary computer, as I have a solid PC at home. However, I've been spending a lot of weekends at my partner's and my mom's place, and I'm looking to get something that I can use while I'm there. I'll be taking a couple classes in the new year, but nothing super demanding. The biggest thing for me is light gaming. I really only ever play The Sims 4, Minecraft, and Stardew, and I don't mind turning the settings down a bit. I really don't care about any other games, since like I said I have my PC at home. Another thing that I can't seem to live without is a numpad lol.\n\nI've been looking at a couple of the IdeaPads, as they seem a bit sturdier than some other brands, and have the specs (i think) i need. My biggest struggle is really understanding the difference in the CPU and GPUs. As you can see in the pics, the 1i has an i5 13th gen, and it has the Intel Iris Xe for graphics. The Slim 3 has the Ryzen 5 7th gen with the AMD Radeon 610M.\n\n  \nI'm also open to any suggestions y'all have. I'm looking to spend \\~$600 CAD (i think $450-500 USD), and I'm open to used or open box. TIA!",

Will it handle long-form video editing and demanding development projects, or should I look for a model with a dedicated GPU / better cooling?

And it started to show overheating issues after a month of usage. I tried all the methods (I was already technical due to having pc building and overclocking experience). After nothing worked I sent my laptop to Janakpuri west Asus service centre. They were only building up so many stories that it just sounds downright terrible to think about that even adult films have better stories and even if they were speaking the truth here's what they said. On 1st week \"Sir, an important component that prevents overheating mandatory miller is missing from your laptop so it will take time\" around 2nd week \"Sir, we have repaired but we haven't tested please wait\" around 3rd week \"sir the component hasn't arrived\" this is so sus asus come on. Then around at 30 days \"Sir, we have sent your laptop to noida service center because our little brains couldn't fix them and my weiner is small\" at 50th day which is today they said \"Sir, your laptop has been sent to Mumbai warehouse and will take another month\". My Class tests midsems and another class test has been over, it about near end sems and I still have been unable to practice javascript, and what if I get a back and fail in my subject ? A messed up laptop ? And what if they still couldn't fix it ? What if they take even more than a month or till new year 2026. I can't bear this anymore but I am just helpless with no support, even the courts are downright bad in India and now even a brand you gave so much money to and trusted. Is 3 months really necessary to fix a laptop you uneducated, unprofessional 12 failures ? Because when it's on us everyone simply blame it on us that you damaged your product you are denied warranty. What should I do ?",

Any hinge or chassis issues?\n* **Noise & heat:** During long Zoom/Teams sessions + multiple docs/tabs, which stays quieter and cooler?\n* **Battery life:** Which one actually lasts longer in real-world use?\n* **Webcam & mics:** Which provides clearer speech for interviews without needing a headset? Does the AI noise suppression make a noticeable difference?\n* **Serviceability & warranty (EU/Poland):** How easy is SSD/battery replacement? Any experience with warranty support?\n* **Light gaming & video editing:** How do these models handle casual gaming or light editing without overheating or throttling?\n* **Longevity:** Which model tends to age better over time (battery health, hinges, keyboard, etc.)?\n\nIf you were in my position — traveling frequently, typing a lot during interviews, and needing a dependable machine for work, study, and occasional fun — which would you choose and why?\n\nThanks a lot!",

Bought it somewhere around 2018 or 2019, and it’s been through *a lot*.\n\nRecently, I got admission into a Data Science degree, and honestly, this laptop can’t handle VS Code or heavy stuff anymore. A few people told me I could just throw in an SSD instead of buying a new one, but I’m not sure if that’s worth it or if I should finally move on.\n\nI do need something reliable for studying, coding, and watching lectures. I’ve been eyeing the Lenovo LOQ (12th or 13th Gen), but my heart’s kinda attached to this old one.\n\nTo make things worse (or funnier), this laptop has some wild stories:\n\n* The battery stopped charging like 3–4 years ago, then *magically* started working again after a year.\n* Then it died again, so I replaced the battery about 5 months ago.\n* 10 days back, it refused to even turn on… I almost took it to a repair shop today, but before going, I decided to open it up — and guess what? It just turned on again 😭😭😭\n\nIt’s been through keyboard and hinge issues too, but it’s so dear to me I don’t think I’ll ever get rid of it completely.\n\n**tl;dr**: My 7–8-year-old Lenovo Ideapad 330 still somehow works, but it struggles with coding and VS Code. Should I just put in an SSD or finally buy a new laptop (thinking Lenovo LOQ 12th/13th gen)?",

And it started to show overheating issues after a month of usage. I tried all the methods (I was already technical due to having pc building and overclocking experience). After nothing worked I sent my laptop to Janakpuri west Asus service centre. They were only building up so many stories that it just sounds downright terrible to think about that even adult films have better stories and even if they were speaking the truth here's what they said. On 1st week \"Sir, an important component that prevents overheating mandatory miller is missing from your laptop so it will take time\" around 2nd week \"Sir, we have repaired but we haven't tested please wait\" around 3rd week \"sir the component hasn't arrived\" this is so sus asus come on. Then around at 30 days \"Sir, we have sent your laptop to noida service center because our little brains couldn't fix them and my weiner is small\" at 50th day which is today they said \"Sir, your laptop has been sent to Mumbai warehouse and will take another month\". My Class tests midsems and another class test has been over, it about near end sems and I still have been unable to practice javascript, and what if I get a back and fail in my subject ? A messed up laptop ? And what if they still couldn't fix it ? What if they take even more than a month or till new year 2026. I can't bear this anymore but I am just helpless with no support, even the courts are downright bad in India and now even a brand you gave so much money to and trusted. Is 3 months really necessary to fix a laptop you uneducated, unprofessional 12 failures ? Because when it's on us everyone simply blame it on us that you damaged your product you are denied warranty.

    "title": "Unacceptable Motherboard Failure Just One Month After Warranty",
    "selftext": "I honestly can’t believe my Lenovo LOQ laptop has failed only 1 year and 1 month after I bought it. The motherboard has completely died, and the warranty had expired just a month ago, which makes this situation extremely disappointing. I never did any heavy gaming or intense usage so I genuinely did not expect such a major failure this soon. To make things worse, the service center is asking ₹50,000 for the motherboard replacement, which is almost the cost of purchasing a new laptop. I’m really not sure what to do in this situation. Are there any suggestions or alternatives available such as goodwill warranty support that I can try? I genuinely need help and guidance here.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I've been searching for a new laptop, as my Asus Vivobook (i know) has finally decided to kick the bucket. The laptop wouldn't be my primary computer, as I have a solid PC at home. However, I've been spending a lot of weekends at my partner's and my mom's place, and I'm looking to get something that I can use while I'm there. I'll be taking a couple classes in the new year, but nothing super demanding. The biggest thing for me is light gaming. I really only ever play The Sims 4, Minecraft, and Stardew, and I don't mind turning the settings down a bit. I really don't care about any other games, since like I said I have my PC at home. Another thing that I can't seem to live without is a numpad lol.\n\nI've been looking at a couple of the IdeaPads, as they seem a bit sturdier than some other brands, and have the specs (i think) i need. My biggest struggle is really understanding the difference in the CPU and GPUs. As you can see in the pics, the 1i has an i5 13th gen, and it has the Intel Iris Xe for graphics. The Slim 3 has the Ryzen 5 7th gen with the AMD Radeon 610M.\n\n  \nI'm also open to any suggestions y'all have. I'm looking to spend \\~$600 CAD (i think $450-500 USD), and I'm open to used or open box. TIA!",

And it started to show overheating issues after a month of usage. I tried all the methods (I was already technical due to having pc building and overclocking experience). After nothing worked I sent my laptop to Janakpuri west Asus service centre. They were only building up so many stories that it just sounds downright terrible to think about that even adult films have better stories and even if they were speaking the truth here's what they said. On 1st week \"Sir, an important component that prevents overheating mandatory miller is missing from your laptop so it will take time\" around 2nd week \"Sir, we have repaired but we haven't tested please wait\" around 3rd week \"sir the component hasn't arrived\" this is so sus asus come on. Then around at 30 days \"Sir, we have sent your laptop to noida service center because our little brains couldn't fix them and my weiner is small\" at 50th day which is today they said \"Sir, your laptop has been sent to Mumbai warehouse and will take another month\". My Class tests midsems and another class test has been over, it about near end sems and I still have been unable to practice javascript, and what if I get a back and fail in my subject ? A messed up laptop ? And what if they still couldn't fix it ? What if they take even more than a month or till new year 2026. I can't bear this anymore but I am just helpless with no support, even the courts are downright bad in India and now even a brand you gave so much money to and trusted. Is 3 months really necessary to fix a laptop you uneducated, unprofessional 12 failures ? Because when it's on us everyone simply blame it on us that you damaged your product you are denied warranty.

The motherboard has completely died, and the warranty had expired just a month ago, which makes this situation extremely disappointing. I never did any heavy gaming or intense usage so I genuinely did not expect such a major failure this soon. To make things worse, the service center is asking ₹50,000 for the motherboard replacement, which is almost the cost of purchasing a new laptop. I’m really not sure what to do in this situation. Are there any suggestions or alternatives available such as goodwill warranty support that I can try? I genuinely need help and guidance here.",

I don't expect miracles, but if I could continue using this PC for a while more till I get a new one would be enough for now.

But I'm not 100% locked into it. \nI'm going for a smaller build because my current one is just too big, but I am worried about the gpu clearance on the second slot or air cooler clearance if I end up with the MSI board, input is appreciated. \nI'm mostly going for just gaming, trying to be future proof if possible, and open to upgrades later on.\nI see a lot of builds with fans under the gpu so I'm wondering if I also need to follow this route for more air intake? Or if not do I just do 3 case fans, 2 on top and 1 rear? Will any 3 pack of case fans be okay? \nI haven't bought any of the components yet, trying to see if there will be sales with upcoming black Friday/ holidays. So nothing set in stone as of yet. \n\nNot sure if I'm forgetting anything else, if my format is weird sorry in advance, was on mobile.

Switching to full screen on YouTube takes 3 or 4 seconds, loading heavy webpages like social media maxes out cpu usage. Browsing folders has a delay. When anti-malware is scanning a new \"exe\" file before executing it, cpu usage is 80% and takes a good while depending on file size. I am fed up with this. It wasn't like this on windows 7, i held on win 7 for too long till two years ago i switched to win 10 ltsc 21. I was forced to buy the ssd and upgraded my ram from 6gb to 12gb and it's still not as fast as win 7, except for start up time.\n\nI am looking for something not very expensive, i live in a 3rd country and because of high taxes I'd have to pay 40% to 100% higher than Europe and USA prices while earning 220 usd/month. \n\nMy options are these, I'd start from least expensive which is preferable if it would be enough for a smooth Windows experience, to the most expensive items i could afford if it has to be that way.\n\nI have a 1080p monitor and already have a mouse and keyboard since i have always used my laptop as a desktop anyways. \n\n1. Ryzen 3500(x) / Ryzen 3600(x) / Ryzen 5500(x) / Ryzen 5600(x) / Ryzen 7500f or maybe i5 12400, i didn't mention 13th and 14th gen because i am afraid I'd have issues of the cpu being faulty.\n\n2. 16gb ram / 32gb ram ( my 12 gb seem to be enough for my usage)\n\n3. GPU which is what i am willing to invest the most, because I'd like to experience good pcsx2 emulation,  I'd also like to experience pubg, counter strike, and maybe, like i couldn't care less if i didn't play them, cod warzone or the new battlefield 6 battle royale.\n\nMy options are : rx580, rtx 3050, rtx 3060, rtx 5050, rtx 5060. I can't afford more, unless i pair a ryzen 3600 with a 5060ti for example. But i rarely play on pc, i still use ps3, xbox 360 and older systems as my main source of entertainment.\n\n Thanks.  ",

    "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nSo.. it's been a while since I last built a PC (all I can remember is I bought an i7 4790k which was at the time the best CPU in the market iirc!) so i'm looking for a Big generational update.\n\nRight now i'm surviving on a PC I bought from a friend when moving countries (Ryzen 5 2600, 16gb ram, Radeon RX Vega 56) that's about to kick the bucket any second now, so the time has come to build something new..\n\nUsage-wise, I program and game; I have two 1440p 144hz screens and I'm pretty happy playing at that rate, I don't plan to jump into 4k any time soon.\n\nSome games I am looking to play that I currently can't at all / can't at a reasonable performance for reference are Cities: Skylines II, PS-ported games like The Last of Us I/II, Ghost of Tsushima, etc, PUBG, Mount&Blade Bannerlord plus some unreleased games that I'd expect a brand-new PC to be able to handle at 1440p at a playable framerate (60+ should be fine)\n\nI would love to stream casually if I can, I did it a while ago when playing games I could afford the performance to play & stream and it's a fun way to keep some company when playing some solo games.\n\n--------------------\n\nFor reasons I can explain later to not overextend now, I have a brand new Thermaltake Core P1 mini ITX case that I was planning on using. [Here's what I have in mind at the moment \\(LINK\\)](https://es.pcpartpicker.com/list/V4xqGJ), coming at almost exactly 2000€\nI have a couple doubts though:\n\na) is a Ryzen 7 9800X3D + 5070 ti too much for someone not looking to play 4k? I understand that having some wiggle room for newer, more demanding games is great, but maybe I'm shooting too high (or too low! I'm out of tune honestly). I considered dialing back to a 7800x3d instead, its 100€ cheaper which is around 20-25% less.\n\nb) The Gigabyte WINDFORCE OC SFF is the cheapest 5070 ti I can find at the moment in PcPartPicker, but browsing my local market I can also get a Zotac RTX 5070 Ti Solid SFF or Asus Prime RTX 5070 Ti for 10€ extra so basically same price. AFAIR all and every 5070 ti in the market should be around the same 1-2% performance so cheapest one should be ok so long as it's from a reputable brand, right ?\n\nc) I understand that a 650w PSU should be good enough for my build, that Fractal Design Ion Gold 850w is just cheaper than both the 750w and 650w versions apparently for some reason, and I saw some good reviews on the Ion Gold 850w, so I was planning on buying whichever of the three was cheaper when I actually go and buy the parts.\n\nc) Ignoring the case for a sec, I noticed all cheaper mobos are mITX, what's the tradeoff here? I would expect more compact form factors should be more expensive, no? If it's just a matter of \"bigger => more features/slots\", and this/a similar motherboard seems to accomodate all the slots I need (one x16 PCIe for the GPU, two M2 slots for NVMe's plus a SATA for an older SSD I want to carry over), if the case doesn't work would it be of to just get a regular ATX case and reuse the mITX mobo, or should I consider getting an ATX board too?\n\nd) Not ignoring the case anymore unfortunately, I'm a little worried that there might not be enough clearence for the CPU cooler and the GPU, and between the CPU cooler and the ram sticks. I know that the case brings a GPU vertical bracket so I could put the GPU there, but the provided riser cable is Gen4, I understand I should get a Gen5 cable if I plan on mounting the GPU sideways?\n\ne) The ASRock B650I Lightning Wifi seems to require a BIOS update to run the 9800x3D; if anyone can correct me, my understanding is that I'd just [download the latest BIOS from their website](https://pg.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B650I%20Lightning%20WiFi/index.asp#BIOS), put it on a freshly-formatted USB drive and I could update the BIOS using the Flashback option without cpu/ram/anything other than mobo+psu?\n\nf) The mobo also specifies that some of the m2 slots are connected to the CPU and others to the chipset, what would be the ideal use for each? I planned on having one 500gb M2 NVMe for the OS and installing general-purpose apps, and a 4tb NVMe just for the steam/epic libraries plus any standalone game I install (the older SSD contains general files; my code repos, virtual tabletop RPG assets, My Games/My Documents directories for savegames, etc)\n\nSorry if this is a bit long, I tried to get everything out there, any help will be much appreciated!",

Any recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated!”\n\nP.S.\nSo I don’t make this mistake again. I remember when I bought a PC and I had just purchased it.

However I also want to play very old games from my time that I never finished like\n\n Omikron: The Nomad Soul.\n (Came out in 1999)\n\nSince I was much younger I can’t even say I really began the game I’ve only been in the beginning.

I have a MUSETEX ATX PC case from Amazon which the model was bought in 2022 (because when I go to the Amazon link I got it from, the pictures and recent reviews have a slightly different model). [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MDFYW3N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MDFYW3N) I've used it for 3 years and only encountered this problem recently.\n\nOn startup, one of my PC case fans takes a few seconds before it starts making a grinding noise, and I'm able to get it to stop after putting my PC to sleep a couple of times and turning it back on until it doesn't come back. It only happens at startup and doesn't come back until I next start it up. I'm sure that isn't good for the PC, but I'm holding out until I solve the problem. I did hear that you can lubricate the fans, but, unfortunately, my fan did not have an accessible place to do that. \n\nThis is the link to the PC fan hub that is used for all the case fans: [https://www.musetex.com/products/fan-controller-1](https://www.musetex.com/products/fan-controller-1)\n\nHere is also what the fans look like: [https://ibb.co/Lh61cTG5](https://ibb.co/Lh61cTG5)\n\nThe fan type is also supposedly a 120mm PWM ARGB Fan, so, with all that information, does anyone have suggestions for a replacement that looks similar to the fans on the case that is under $50? Definitely doesn't have to be the same brand (especially since I don't think they make that exact fan anymore)",

I think b650 should suffice for 7800 or b850 for 9800.\n- ddr5 32gb (2x16) tentatively CL36 due to price and most options in Best Buy (i will try to match price with Microcenter).\n- I am thinking to get a 1TB or 2 TB nVMe drive, which one would you recommend?\n\nThanks in advance!",

During gaming it doesn't really get louder but I do notice that when I exit a game the frequency/pitch drops ever so slightly. \n\n--- https://streamable.com/c/g593jd - first video demonstrates the sound/noise, in the second video I'm flipping off the PSU power switch (don't mind the loud thump in the background). \n\nI'm not sure where it is coming from but I've figured out it is not chassis fan or graphics card fans. If I put my ear to the back of the PSU the noise gets dampened by the quiet humming of the PSU fans. So that leaves CPU cooler I suppose. \nIf I put my finger on the center/hub of the CPU cooler/fan (not on the blades but where the sticker is) and press on it with some force, the noise gets dampened a bit.\n\nWhat does that mean? Does this simply mean I need a new CPU cooler (thumbs down) or is there something else I can check/adjust?\n\nI'm a noob in this world. Thank you for your help.",

I'll be playing AAA, RPGs, and very rarely some competitive games. Planning to stick with 1440p for now, no 4K.\n\nIs the 9800X3D worth the extra $419 for pure gaming with a 5070 Ti at 1440p? Or would I get more value/experience upgrade from the 9600X + OLED combo?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's made a similar decision or has experience with either of these CPUs paired with high end GPUs.

    "selftext": "I've bought the Asus TUF 5070Ti, i almost feel guilty buying this and not the MSI Gaming Trio purely because people keep saying \"Anything but ASUS\" or \"Don't buy ASUS\". \n\nShould i have gone for the MSI?\n\nI understand the issues around ASUS RMA, but i got mine via Amazon so i'm hoping if i do ever use the RMA process that it would have improved from the GamersNexus videos regarding it and Amazon would chip in and help out. \n\n  \nThe main reasons getting the TUF over Gaming Trio was a Reddit post comparing the two and most people choosing the TUF and also the TUF having a bigger heatsink cooling better according to tests and wanting a quiet card, it's in white and having heard good stuff about the TUF durability and reliability as i plan to keep it for 4 years.\n\n  \nI also had the PNY 5070Ti and after having fan issues, i just wanted to pay more to get the better, bigger, quieter, cooler, better looking card from the top brand.\n\nIs buying ASUS now really that bad or are people just giving them digs as they've been naughty recently and want to protest by buying elsewhere?\n\n  \nTLDR: 1. Am i wrong for choosing ASUS TUF over MSI Gaming Trio? 2. Is the RMA really that bad still should i need to use it? (UK Based)",

Switching to full screen on YouTube takes 3 or 4 seconds, loading heavy webpages like social media maxes out cpu usage. Browsing folders has a delay. When anti-malware is scanning a new \"exe\" file before executing it, cpu usage is 80% and takes a good while depending on file size. I am fed up with this. It wasn't like this on windows 7, i held on win 7 for too long till two years ago i switched to win 10 ltsc 21. I was forced to buy the ssd and upgraded my ram from 6gb to 12gb and it's still not as fast as win 7, except for start up time.\n\nI am looking for something not very expensive, i live in a 3rd country and because of high taxes I'd have to pay 40% to 100% higher than Europe and USA prices while earning 220 usd/month. \n\nMy options are these, I'd start from least expensive which is preferable if it would be enough for a smooth Windows experience, to the most expensive items i could afford if it has to be that way.\n\nI have a 1080p monitor and already have a mouse and keyboard since i have always used my laptop as a desktop anyways. \n\n1. Ryzen 3500(x) / Ryzen 3600(x) / Ryzen 5500(x) / Ryzen 5600(x) / Ryzen 7500f or maybe i5 12400, i didn't mention 13th and 14th gen because i am afraid I'd have issues of the cpu being faulty.\n\n2. 16gb ram / 32gb ram ( my 12 gb seem to be enough for my usage)\n\n3. GPU which is what i am willing to invest the most, because I'd like to experience good pcsx2 emulation,  I'd also like to experience pubg, counter strike, and maybe, like i couldn't care less if i didn't play them, cod warzone or the new battlefield 6 battle royale.\n\nMy options are : rx580, rtx 3050, rtx 3060, rtx 5050, rtx 5060. I can't afford more, unless i pair a ryzen 3600 with a 5060ti for example. But i rarely play on pc, i still use ps3, xbox 360 and older systems as my main source of entertainment.\n\n Thanks.  ",

    "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nSo.. it's been a while since I last built a PC (all I can remember is I bought an i7 4790k which was at the time the best CPU in the market iirc!) so i'm looking for a Big generational update.\n\nRight now i'm surviving on a PC I bought from a friend when moving countries (Ryzen 5 2600, 16gb ram, Radeon RX Vega 56) that's about to kick the bucket any second now, so the time has come to build something new..\n\nUsage-wise, I program and game; I have two 1440p 144hz screens and I'm pretty happy playing at that rate, I don't plan to jump into 4k any time soon.\n\nSome games I am looking to play that I currently can't at all / can't at a reasonable performance for reference are Cities: Skylines II, PS-ported games like The Last of Us I/II, Ghost of Tsushima, etc, PUBG, Mount&Blade Bannerlord plus some unreleased games that I'd expect a brand-new PC to be able to handle at 1440p at a playable framerate (60+ should be fine)\n\nI would love to stream casually if I can, I did it a while ago when playing games I could afford the performance to play & stream and it's a fun way to keep some company when playing some solo games.\n\n--------------------\n\nFor reasons I can explain later to not overextend now, I have a brand new Thermaltake Core P1 mini ITX case that I was planning on using. [Here's what I have in mind at the moment \\(LINK\\)](https://es.pcpartpicker.com/list/V4xqGJ), coming at almost exactly 2000€\nI have a couple doubts though:\n\na) is a Ryzen 7 9800X3D + 5070 ti too much for someone not looking to play 4k? I understand that having some wiggle room for newer, more demanding games is great, but maybe I'm shooting too high (or too low! I'm out of tune honestly). I considered dialing back to a 7800x3d instead, its 100€ cheaper which is around 20-25% less.\n\nb) The Gigabyte WINDFORCE OC SFF is the cheapest 5070 ti I can find at the moment in PcPartPicker, but browsing my local market I can also get a Zotac RTX 5070 Ti Solid SFF or Asus Prime RTX 5070 Ti for 10€ extra so basically same price. AFAIR all and every 5070 ti in the market should be around the same 1-2% performance so cheapest one should be ok so long as it's from a reputable brand, right ?\n\nc) I understand that a 650w PSU should be good enough for my build, that Fractal Design Ion Gold 850w is just cheaper than both the 750w and 650w versions apparently for some reason, and I saw some good reviews on the Ion Gold 850w, so I was planning on buying whichever of the three was cheaper when I actually go and buy the parts.\n\nc) Ignoring the case for a sec, I noticed all cheaper mobos are mITX, what's the tradeoff here? I would expect more compact form factors should be more expensive, no? If it's just a matter of \"bigger => more features/slots\", and this/a similar motherboard seems to accomodate all the slots I need (one x16 PCIe for the GPU, two M2 slots for NVMe's plus a SATA for an older SSD I want to carry over), if the case doesn't work would it be of to just get a regular ATX case and reuse the mITX mobo, or should I consider getting an ATX board too?\n\nd) Not ignoring the case anymore unfortunately, I'm a little worried that there might not be enough clearence for the CPU cooler and the GPU, and between the CPU cooler and the ram sticks. I know that the case brings a GPU vertical bracket so I could put the GPU there, but the provided riser cable is Gen4, I understand I should get a Gen5 cable if I plan on mounting the GPU sideways?\n\ne) The ASRock B650I Lightning Wifi seems to require a BIOS update to run the 9800x3D; if anyone can correct me, my understanding is that I'd just [download the latest BIOS from their website](https://pg.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B650I%20Lightning%20WiFi/index.asp#BIOS), put it on a freshly-formatted USB drive and I could update the BIOS using the Flashback option without cpu/ram/anything other than mobo+psu?\n\nf) The mobo also specifies that some of the m2 slots are connected to the CPU and others to the chipset, what would be the ideal use for each? I planned on having one 500gb M2 NVMe for the OS and installing general-purpose apps, and a 4tb NVMe just for the steam/epic libraries plus any standalone game I install (the older SSD contains general files; my code repos, virtual tabletop RPG assets, My Games/My Documents directories for savegames, etc)\n\nSorry if this is a bit long, I tried to get everything out there, any help will be much appreciated!",

During gaming it doesn't really get louder but I do notice that when I exit a game the frequency/pitch drops ever so slightly. \n\n--- https://streamable.com/c/g593jd - first video demonstrates the sound/noise, in the second video I'm flipping off the PSU power switch (don't mind the loud thump in the background). \n\nI'm not sure where it is coming from but I've figured out it is not chassis fan or graphics card fans. If I put my ear to the back of the PSU the noise gets dampened by the quiet humming of the PSU fans. So that leaves CPU cooler I suppose. \nIf I put my finger on the center/hub of the CPU cooler/fan (not on the blades but where the sticker is) and press on it with some force, the noise gets dampened a bit.\n\nWhat does that mean? Does this simply mean I need a new CPU cooler (thumbs down) or is there something else I can check/adjust?\n\nI'm a noob in this world. Thank you for your help.",

Will any 3 pack of case fans be okay? \nI haven't bought any of the components yet, trying to see if there will be sales with upcoming black Friday/ holidays.

But now, out of nowhere, even **medium settings** drop to **8–10 FPS**, and some games can’t go above 20–30 FPS even on the **lowest** settings.\n\nHere’s what I’ve checked so far:\n\n* The GPU is detected properly, display works fine.\n* Fans spin normally.\n* I’ve installed the latest NVIDIA drivers.\n* Temps seem okay at idle.\n* Nothing in the system has been changed (same PSU, CPU, RAM, etc.).\n\nIt feels like the GPU isn’t really “working” under load — like it’s stuck at low performance mode or being throttled.\n\nAny idea what could be going on?

I'll be playing AAA, RPGs, and very rarely some competitive games. Planning to stick with 1440p for now, no 4K.\n\nIs the 9800X3D worth the extra $419 for pure gaming with a 5070 Ti at 1440p?

Switching to full screen on YouTube takes 3 or 4 seconds, loading heavy webpages like social media maxes out cpu usage. Browsing folders has a delay. When anti-malware is scanning a new \"exe\" file before executing it, cpu usage is 80% and takes a good while depending on file size. I am fed up with this. It wasn't like this on windows 7, i held on win 7 for too long till two years ago i switched to win 10 ltsc 21. I was forced to buy the ssd and upgraded my ram from 6gb to 12gb and it's still not as fast as win 7, except for start up time.\n\nI am looking for something not very expensive, i live in a 3rd country and because of high taxes I'd have to pay 40% to 100% higher than Europe and USA prices while earning 220 usd/month. \n\nMy options are these, I'd start from least expensive which is preferable if it would be enough for a smooth Windows experience, to the most expensive items i could afford if it has to be that way.\n\nI have a 1080p monitor and already have a mouse and keyboard since i have always used my laptop as a desktop anyways. \n\n1. Ryzen 3500(x) / Ryzen 3600(x) / Ryzen 5500(x) / Ryzen 5600(x) / Ryzen 7500f or maybe i5 12400, i didn't mention 13th and 14th gen because i am afraid I'd have issues of the cpu being faulty.\n\n2. 16gb ram / 32gb ram ( my 12 gb seem to be enough for my usage)\n\n3. GPU which is what i am willing to invest the most, because I'd like to experience good pcsx2 emulation,  I'd also like to experience pubg, counter strike, and maybe, like i couldn't care less if i didn't play them, cod warzone or the new battlefield 6 battle royale.\n\nMy options are : rx580, rtx 3050, rtx 3060, rtx 5050, rtx 5060. I can't afford more, unless i pair a ryzen 3600 with a 5060ti for example. But i rarely play on pc, i still use ps3, xbox 360 and older systems as my main source of entertainment.\n\n Thanks.  ",

    "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nSo.. it's been a while since I last built a PC (all I can remember is I bought an i7 4790k which was at the time the best CPU in the market iirc!) so i'm looking for a Big generational update.\n\nRight now i'm surviving on a PC I bought from a friend when moving countries (Ryzen 5 2600, 16gb ram, Radeon RX Vega 56) that's about to kick the bucket any second now, so the time has come to build something new..\n\nUsage-wise, I program and game; I have two 1440p 144hz screens and I'm pretty happy playing at that rate, I don't plan to jump into 4k any time soon.\n\nSome games I am looking to play that I currently can't at all / can't at a reasonable performance for reference are Cities: Skylines II, PS-ported games like The Last of Us I/II, Ghost of Tsushima, etc, PUBG, Mount&Blade Bannerlord plus some unreleased games that I'd expect a brand-new PC to be able to handle at 1440p at a playable framerate (60+ should be fine)\n\nI would love to stream casually if I can, I did it a while ago when playing games I could afford the performance to play & stream and it's a fun way to keep some company when playing some solo games.\n\n--------------------\n\nFor reasons I can explain later to not overextend now, I have a brand new Thermaltake Core P1 mini ITX case that I was planning on using. [Here's what I have in mind at the moment \\(LINK\\)](https://es.pcpartpicker.com/list/V4xqGJ), coming at almost exactly 2000€\nI have a couple doubts though:\n\na) is a Ryzen 7 9800X3D + 5070 ti too much for someone not looking to play 4k? I understand that having some wiggle room for newer, more demanding games is great, but maybe I'm shooting too high (or too low! I'm out of tune honestly). I considered dialing back to a 7800x3d instead, its 100€ cheaper which is around 20-25% less.\n\nb) The Gigabyte WINDFORCE OC SFF is the cheapest 5070 ti I can find at the moment in PcPartPicker, but browsing my local market I can also get a Zotac RTX 5070 Ti Solid SFF or Asus Prime RTX 5070 Ti for 10€ extra so basically same price. AFAIR all and every 5070 ti in the market should be around the same 1-2% performance so cheapest one should be ok so long as it's from a reputable brand, right ?\n\nc) I understand that a 650w PSU should be good enough for my build, that Fractal Design Ion Gold 850w is just cheaper than both the 750w and 650w versions apparently for some reason, and I saw some good reviews on the Ion Gold 850w, so I was planning on buying whichever of the three was cheaper when I actually go and buy the parts.\n\nc) Ignoring the case for a sec, I noticed all cheaper mobos are mITX, what's the tradeoff here? I would expect more compact form factors should be more expensive, no? If it's just a matter of \"bigger => more features/slots\", and this/a similar motherboard seems to accomodate all the slots I need (one x16 PCIe for the GPU, two M2 slots for NVMe's plus a SATA for an older SSD I want to carry over), if the case doesn't work would it be of to just get a regular ATX case and reuse the mITX mobo, or should I consider getting an ATX board too?\n\nd) Not ignoring the case anymore unfortunately, I'm a little worried that there might not be enough clearence for the CPU cooler and the GPU, and between the CPU cooler and the ram sticks. I know that the case brings a GPU vertical bracket so I could put the GPU there, but the provided riser cable is Gen4, I understand I should get a Gen5 cable if I plan on mounting the GPU sideways?\n\ne) The ASRock B650I Lightning Wifi seems to require a BIOS update to run the 9800x3D; if anyone can correct me, my understanding is that I'd just [download the latest BIOS from their website](https://pg.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B650I%20Lightning%20WiFi/index.asp#BIOS), put it on a freshly-formatted USB drive and I could update the BIOS using the Flashback option without cpu/ram/anything other than mobo+psu?\n\nf) The mobo also specifies that some of the m2 slots are connected to the CPU and others to the chipset, what would be the ideal use for each? I planned on having one 500gb M2 NVMe for the OS and installing general-purpose apps, and a 4tb NVMe just for the steam/epic libraries plus any standalone game I install (the older SSD contains general files; my code repos, virtual tabletop RPG assets, My Games/My Documents directories for savegames, etc)\n\nSorry if this is a bit long, I tried to get everything out there, any help will be much appreciated!",

But I don’t want to get a rig that tells me that I need to upgrade my GPU again when I just bought the computer.\n\n\n\n1.\tCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D or Ryzen 9 7900X.\n\t2.\tGPU: NVIDIA RTX 4060 or RTX 4070.\n\t3.\tMotherboard: A B550 or X670 motherboard, compatible with your chosen CPU (for example, ASUS TUF Gaming B550 or MSI MEG X670).\n\t4.\tRAM: 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5, ideally around 5600MHz.\n\t5.\tSSD: 1TB NVMe SSD, like the Samsung 970 EVO or WD Black SN850.\n\t6.\tPower Supply: A reliable 650W or 750W 80 Plus Gold PSU, like the Corsair RM750x.\n\t7.\tCooling: A good air cooler like the Noctua NH-U12S or a 240mm AIO liquid cooler from Corsair or NZXT.\n\t8.\tCase: A mid-tower case with good airflow, like the NZXT H510 or the Fractal Design Meshify C.\n\t9.\tAdditional Storage: Optional, but you could add a secondary HDD for extra storage if needed.\n\t10.\tCase Fans: Additional 120mm fans for better airflow if your case supports them.",

Each puzzle is based on real electrical problems - like building a charger from scratch or regulating voltage... It's all powered by an actual [SPICE simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE), so circuits behave the way they would in real life.\n\nWe’re trying to make electronics *feel approachable and creative*, instead of intimidating. You can mess around, short-circuit things (safely!), and learn by doing.\n\nIt’s equal parts **STEM sandbox** and **cozy story game** \\- we are thinking of adding in lo-fi beats and already have pastel visuals, and a hamster named Crispy who occasionally powers your circuits with his wheel.\n\nWe’d love to hear what the PC gaming crowd thinks:\n\n* Do educational-but-cozy games like this appeal to you?\n* Would you rather see more structured challenges, or full sandbox freedom to experiment?\n\nAppreciate any feedback, especially from folks who would find themselves at the crossroads of:\n\n* Assemble With Care\n* Trash Goblin\n* Spirit City: Lofi Sessions\n* PC Building Simulator\n* Little Rocket Lab",

Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! 🙏",

    "title": "Why do so many people dislike the Epic Games Launcher’s UI? Am I missing something?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, hope you’re all doing good.\n\nSo I saw a post earlier where someone was asking whether to buy *Arc Raiders* on Epic or Steam. They ended up going with Steam, which is fair, but it reminded me how every time this topic comes up people go *“Steam’s better. Epic’s UI sucks.”*\n\nAnd I’m just curious, what *exactly* is it that people dislike so much about Epic’s UI?\n\nI use both pretty evenly, and honestly, they feel about the same to me. Most of what I do is:\n\n* Buy games\n* Read game pages / watch trailers\n* Launch games\n\nFor those things, both launchers get the job done. Epic even loads faster on my PC, Steam always does its little update check on startup, which takes a bit.\n\nWhen it comes to the library, I actually kinda prefer Epic’s layout. The quick launch tab and filters (like “installed only” or “recently added”) are super handy. Steam’s library always feels a bit cluttered unless I manually organize everything.\n\nThat said, Steam definitely wins once you click on a specific game, the playtime, achievements, screenshots, reviews, all that. Epic mostly just shows the title unless you go to the store page.\n\nStill, in day-to-day use, I just click *Play* or *Launch* and that’s it. Steam has Big Picture Mode and better controller input stuff, sure, but I don’t really use overlays or custom mappings anyway since my Xbox controller works fine in most games.\n\nSo yeah, for people who *really* dislike Epic’s launcher:  \n\\-What is it specifically that bothers you?  \n\\-Is it missing features like achievements/workshop/etc.?  \n\\-Or do you just find the design itself clunky or ugly?\n\nNot talking about the “I want all my games in one place” thing, that’s fair. I mean purely when people say Epic’s *UI/UX* is bad. What about it makes it bad to you?\n\n**TL;DR:** I use both Steam and Epic about the same and don’t see a big difference. What about Epic’s *UI* makes people dislike it so much?",

The new game is also completely broken and not playable \n\nIt feels like every new game that comes out is so broken and incomplete.

    "selftext": "I've been making Skyformer full time since 2021 with both my own game engine and art, and I'm finally announcing the PC Early Access release date on Steam for November 10th 2025. \n\nIt's a first-person survival/automation/crafting game where you're a little robot sent to a planet with the assignment to make it habitable. You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community: [https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

    "selftext": "How were games being developed 10-20 years ago in shorter time frames with extreme technological limitations compared to today, and yet those games were perceived much higher quality while the studios were happy with their profit margins?  \n  \nCompared to today, where you would think that with how far we’ve come with technological advancement that games should be much easier to make, cost far less money to create(especially digital copies reducing disk/case production), and should run far better with the amazing hardware we all have. Yet all we hear is company XYZ cutting corners, firing staff, poor optimizations, $90 price tag etc. while somehow these companies are also still not making enough money?  \n  \nFor example, how was Infinity Ward/Activision able to make one of the greatest COD games MW2 in 16 months and run on a PS3 with 256mb ram near flawlessly, but I can’t even run Warzone smoothly on low settings on my fucking RTX5070 with 32gb RAM, and they’ve been actively developing/patching that garbage for like 5-7 years? Not to mention the fact they’ve milked revenue from that game the whole time through skins while MW2 was being patched for free.     \n  \n  \nIt sounds stupid, but did these companies forget about saving money by hiring talented people who can manage projects and create quality products within reasonable constraints, who understand limitations and can be creative to work around them? Why are studios hiring people who create garbage then spend a year(s) post production patching the game to make it playable? In the construction industry there’s a saying we use along the lines of, “If you have time to come back and fix it, you had time to do it right the first time.”. \n  \nBit of a rant but also a general curiosity on how this industry has completely evolved to something that doesn’t seem to understand what they’ve got their hands on. This seems like the best time to make unbelievable money and create amazing quality games and it just isn’t happening for some of these big names.\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n",

Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system. Notice how a lot of competitive games are labeled as \"toxic\"? Its because people are always blaming others.\n\nI can't think of a single time where I hard raged in a single player game. Why?

    "selftext": "*Amazon.com Inc. is gutting its video-game division as part of a sweeping layoff that will eliminate more than 14,000 corporate jobs.*\n\n*The company didn’t say how many roles it will cut in the video-game unit, but noted in a memo to staff on Tuesday that the cuts would largely fall on its offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well at its central publishing division. The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs.*\n\n*“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” wrote Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Games, in an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg News.*",

No team, no budget, no clue where to even start.\n\nPretty quickly I realized I had no chance of actually building it the way I imagined. It needed proper multiplayer tech, and nothing out there could really handle what I wanted. So I shelved the game and spent years learning and building the networking tech that could.\n\nThat ended up becoming my main thing for a long time - just grinding, learning, figuring it out piece by piece.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally had the right team and the tools to do it properly. We started development, and yesterday we finally got to reveal it.\n\nA big milestone for our small studio.\n\nAnchor is an underwater survival PvP game with sharks, underwater bases, guns, and a massive ocean world to explore. It also has an optional sandbox SOLO/CO-OP mode.\n\nIt’s been a long road, but this one’s been a dream for years.\n\nWishlists mean a lot and feedback is immensely valuable. This really is a game that needs to be built together with the community.\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043460/Anchor/)\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbCGRPrVuk)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.fearem.com/](https://discord.fearem.com/)",

    "selftext": "Hi r/PCGaming!\n\nI'm Vince, solo developer of Decimation. Its a sci-fi tower defense game where your towers provide covering fire, but they can't win without you actively fighting with your hero.  \n  \n**What makes it different:**   \nMost tower defense games: Place towers optimally, watch them win. Maybe a hero helps occasionally. In Decimation, if you're not actively using your hero to fight, you lose.   \n  \n**Your hero has:**\n\n* 4 active skills requiring timing and positioning \n* Target-lock system (you choose priority targets, towers can't) \n* Resource collection mid-combat for ultimate ability \n* Meaningful skill expression - button mashing ≠ skillful play\n\nYou can survive by coasting on easier difficulties, but zero-damage perfect runs require execution.  \nThink: TD macro (placement, resources, tower upgrades) + action micro (hero combat with cooldown management, positioning, battle effect usage).\n\n**About the demo:**\n\n* 4 campaign levels (Act 1 complete) \n* 1 boss encounter\n\n*Note: Levels 1-2 teach mechanics.* ***Levels 3-4 + boss are where skill expression really matters.***\n\n**Free to download and play**  \n🎮 Demo Download: [https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation](https://duskblood.itch.io/decimation)  \n  \nThis is a solo passion project. 17 months of development so far. Early Access planned for late 2025 with 3 additional acts for the final game. I'll be around to answer questions about the game, the development process, or anything else.   \n  \nThanks all and sincerely hope to hear from you. Would genuinely love feedback on whether the skill-based approach resonates with TD players.",

    "selftext": "I picked it up yesterday to play with my friends for the first time. I was surprised (in a positive way) at how mechanicaly complex it can be, especially the organizing and reparing the RV part of the game. It seems like the type of game that it's both fun and exciting to master in the long run, BUT I was astonished at how bad it overall works. To the point of taking you out of the immersion multiple times.\n\n\\- This is a physics-based game in which the physics barely work. The rope, the constantly clipping in and out of the RV, the weird collision issues... it's everywhere.\n\n\\- This is a pity, but there's barely a sense of danger or stakes whatosever. From time to time an animal will attack, or there will be a terrain obstacle to overcome, but that's pretty much it. In a way it's cool, this can be a calmer game that, let's say, Peak or REPO. But it also means that in the moment to moment gameplay it can sometimes be somewhat boring, especially because--\n\n\\- This is one of my biggest complaints right now. The multiplayer of this game i feel is not balanced. There were four of us in the RV, and for most of the time, it feels like the game would have worked better with just two. It didn't seem to me like there was much to be done. The person driving has such and advantage mechanically, and there can also be a person looking at the map, but other than that, this is not a Sea of Theves type of thing were EVERY person is needed to manouver the boat. The other two of us were just in the back, seated because you can NOT be walking around the RV while someone's driving because the physics turn crazy. That means it's not a time that you can spend maybe organising the cabinets, playing cards (this is not a mechanic but it would be cool) or something like that.\n\nI want to end on a positive note. Like I said, I really love the premise of the game. It's so unique and full of potential (the chain-smoking is hilarious). If it was well polished and with expanded mechanics, this could be like a land version of Sea of Thieves. But right now is everything but polished. It's so bizarre to me that this is a 1.0 release and not an early access.",

Think *Assemble With Care* meets *Trash Goblin* \\- but with resistors, LEDs, and a tiny hamster helping you fix things.\n\n[Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3587450/Crispy_Circuits/)\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-YcvKScI9Y)\n\nYou play as **Giddily**, an 11-year-old prodigy who helps neighbours repair gadgets while secretly working on her big project: restoring her hamster’s RC plane. Each puzzle is based on real electrical problems - like building a charger from scratch or regulating voltage... It's all powered by an actual [SPICE simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE), so circuits behave the way they would in real life.\n\nWe’re trying to make electronics *feel approachable and creative*, instead of intimidating. You can mess around, short-circuit things (safely!), and learn by doing.\n\nIt’s equal parts **STEM sandbox** and **cozy story game** \\- we are thinking of adding in lo-fi beats and already have pastel visuals, and a hamster named Crispy who occasionally powers your circuits with his wheel.\n\nWe’d love to hear what the PC gaming crowd thinks:\n\n* Do educational-but-cozy games like this appeal to you?\n* Would you rather see more structured challenges, or full sandbox freedom to experiment?\n\nAppreciate any feedback, especially from folks who would find themselves at the crossroads of:\n\n* Assemble With Care\n* Trash Goblin\n* Spirit City: Lofi Sessions\n* PC Building Simulator\n* Little Rocket Lab",

Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! 🙏",

I went with the MSI MAG Pano 110R case for its clean design and panoramic glass panels.\n\nUnfortunately, I also learned that those small snap-in clips can be a bit too convenient. Just as the system finally booted for the first time, the main panel popped loose and shattered.\n\nIt turns out the tempered glass has a clear safety film on the back that’s invisible to the eye, holding the splintered surface neatly in place. I hadn’t peeled the front film yet. I probablynever would have, yes im that person. So now I’m left with an accidental “cracked ice” finish.\n\nA rough start, but I’ll call it character. The system runs beautifully after some fine-tuning — EXPO enabled, PBO balanced, and a negative curve optimization on the CPU for cooler performance.\n\nSpecs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X\n\nGPU: Gigabyte RTX 5060 Ti OC 16 GB\n\nMotherboard: Aorus X870 ICE Stealth\n\nRAM: 32 GB Klevv Bolt V DDR5 6000 MHz (CL28)\n\nPSU: MSI MPG A1000G \n\nCooler: upHere up2 Dual-Tower 8-Pipe with dual 120 mm fans\n\nStorage: 2 TB NVMe Gen 4 M.2\n\nCase: MSI MAG Pano 110R (now featuring unintentional “tempered aesthetics”)\n\n\nThanks to the PCMasterRace community for keeping the enthusiasm alive and helping so many of us get back into building again.",

    "selftext": "I need your expert advice on cooling my setup. I notice that my CPU gets quite hot and I think it's because of the radiator configuration.\nWhen I'm gaming in 4K (my main use), the coolant temperature of my AIO rises to 50°C, causing the CPU to reach very high temperatures (around 90-100°C) and probably thermal throttling.\nRelevant Hardware\n• CPU: Intel i7-14700K\n• GPU: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER GAMING OC 16GB\n• AIO: Corsair iCUE LINK H170i LCD (420mm Radiator)\n• Case: Corsair iCUE 7000X\n• Side Fans: 4x 120mm (Corsair QX120)\n• Front Fans: 3x 140mm (Corsair QX140)\nCurrent Configuration (The Problem)\n• AIO (420mm): Mounted on the ROOF as EXHAUST (exhausting air).\n• Sides (4x 120mm): Mounted as INTAKE (introducing air).\n• Front (3x 140mm): Mounted as INTAKE (introducing air).\nMy theory is that the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER generates a ton of heat inside the case. The roof radiator is trying to cool the liquid using that already hot air released by the GPU, and that is why it becomes saturated and the liquid reaches 50°C.\nThe Doubt (The Proposed Solution)\nI am seriously thinking about removing and changing the H170i radiator (420mm) to the FRONT as an INTAKE (introducing fresh air from outside).\nMy big question is: If I do this, will the (now warm) air coming through the front radiator \"cook\" my 4070 Ti SUPER?\nI have to keep in mind that the 4 side fans will still blow cool air directly into the GPU, so maybe that compensates for the warm air on the front.\nWhat do you think? What is the optimal configuration to balance CPU and GPU temperatures in this chassis? Do I let the CPU \"suffer\" to give 100% cool air to the GPU, or do I drastically improve the CPU temperature at the risk of raising the GPU a few degrees?\nThank you very much for your help!",

I’ve been hunting around for debloating tools and I’ve come across a few tools (mainly Chris Titus’s tool and wintoys) but I don’t exactly know what they are doing when they for example disable telemetry, are they doing the same thing or going about the same goal in different ways? Would using both cause problems?\n\nI’ve also been looking at the MicroWim tool built into the Chris Titus tool, and wonder since I plan on doing a factory reset for my gaming pc bc it full of junk files and the laptop is already empty would it be better to make a debloated iso and just load that onto my machines? Does this give a more debloated os than using the tool to remove them after installing or can you achieve the same thing? Do I lose my windows key if I do that?\n\nIn the end Im just looking for the best way to rlly debloat windows and somewhat understand what it’s actually doing to my system so if you have insight on how exactly these tools work or realize I’m just clueless and have a proven method that I should set and forget all input is appreciated.",

Now, its time for my headset and I'm more lost than I was with any of the previous components so I need suggestions/explanations. \n\nIdk what to look for (bass, treble, etc), but I'll be using it for movies, music, and games not special audio files and not fps or quick reaction games, more so cinematic across the board. Think two steps from hell, final fantasy, clair obscure. In general content that is greatly enhanced by a symphonic accompaniment. I'd like something that really maximizes that sort of feeling; songs with a full orchestra, band, and choir, and being able to pick out ALL of the different components. Idk what I need for that, or really any of the actual audio impacts of terms like \"open or closed back\" or \"high bass but low treble accuracy\" on what I want. \n\nHow much I'm willing to spend really depends on quality and how long it'll last. If it'll last a few years I'd go up to $250, maybe $300 if it's really good sound. If it's guaranteed to last the next decade with 8+ hours of daily use I'd go up to around $1000. The one thing I'm struggling to find is good quality WITH a mic. I've seen reviews saying the Beyerdynamics 330x is trash in quality and the 990 pro is awesome, but I need a mic that is not stand alone as I'm often in calls with friends who have moved to other states or other continents. I don't want the cloud 3 because it's manufactured much more cheaply than the cloud 2 based on everything I've seen. ",

I went to BIOS enabled it and my pc didn t boot into windows. I have CSM disabled and TPM enabled. I firstly disabled secure boot. I tried restoring to factory keys so i changed from secure boot mode: standard to custom. I pressed YES for install factory keys and YES to reboot. After rebooting i enabled secure boot again. It didn t boot back to windows but to bios instead and my system mode changed from user to deployed. When i entered user mode and changed secure boot mode from custom to standard, saved and exit, PC didn t boot to windows but to bios and system mode remained user. I will attach pictures. I tried multiple times to enable secure boot and no luck.\n\nAnother thing i discovered is that i have some windows leftovers on my HDD for some reason. They dont seem to be something important, but when i try to open a certain folder it denies access.\n\nIn boot options i have Windows Boot Manager (KINGSTON....). When i was watching tutorials on how to enable secure boot, i saw that they had UEFI instead of Windows Boot Manager, is it a problem?\n\nI realized that my BIOS version is F13b - i assume \"b\" stands for beta.

XFX support was extremely painless, replaced them immediately. A month later the one fan not replaced is dying and they're sending me a replacement via the original ticket with no extra fuss.\n\n===============================\n\nA few months back I'd been noticing the GPU (standard mount orientation. fans on the bottom side) was hitting almost 90c while gaming and just assumed it was just \"big gpu, crappy airflow.\" So i took the glass panel off and temps dropped to the upper 70s and that seemed good enough.  \n  \nThen, about a month ago, I moved my setup into a Xhuttle (case by SSUPD) where, due to the orientation of the rig, the gpu fans are visible at all times. I immediately noticed 2 of the fans didn't spin, with only the 3rd fan (furthest from the outputs) spinning at mach i'm-tired-boss. Since the fans are magnetically attached, i shuffled them around and verified the two were bad.\n\nI submitted a ticket and detailed my troubleshooting steps and they had a pair of fans out to me within a couple days.  \n  \nThen yesterday i noticed the one fan we didn't replace now needs a push start most of the time. Updated the old ticket to let them know and they're sending out a fan today.\n\nSo kudos to XFX all around on this one. Not only was the support experience excellent, the fans attaching with what is basically magsafe tech was enough to keep me running even on a single fan, simply by moving it to where it was doing the most good. Really cool tech and I'm glad to have had such a positive experience from a support request.",

When I first assembled everything, it worked fine for a few hours. After putting the PC to sleep and trying to turn it back on, it wouldn’t power up. I checked all the connections, removed the GPU, reassembled everything, and it turned on again.\n\nIt ran fine for a week, until today the same thing happened. When I pressed the power button, the motherboard lights came on for a few seconds, then everything shut off. After that, it wouldn’t show any signs of life.\n\nThen I remembered that my PSU was connected to a smart plug. I removed it and plugged the PSU directly into the surge protector (which I believe is 10A), and it worked again. Could that be the problem?\n\nThe smart plug supports up to 10A and says: *Input: AC 100–240V; 10A; 50–60Hz.*  \nI don’t think my PC draws more than 10A, but I’ve read that the startup surge when the capacitors charge can exceed that.

I changed the gpu after a week to a 9070 xt( that gpu was just until i got this), and right on the day i changed it i noticed some brightness flickering on my monitor contiuing for a bit after restarting, i had some problems with the browser aswell. It would lag like crazy if i had a game open and tried using it. These things didn't happen before the spill. Last night i installed pubg, steam told me to install network frame 3.5, i did, i opened pubg and BSOD. I restarted the pc, again BSOD. First time i don't remember the error, but the second time and everytime i try to open pubg i get a BSOD and something like \"Attempted write to readonly memory\". I downloaded memtest and well, you can see for yourselves.",

    "selftext": "In Adrenalin Driver 25.10.1, AMD officially switch the RX 5000 and 6000 Series from the Main Driver to the Maintenance Driver, just like the RX 400 and 500 Series in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe difference between the Main Driver and the Maintenance Driver is that there is no optimization support for new games, but hardware support, such as the Bug Driver and Crash Driver, is still provided in non-gaming applications.\n\n\n\nThis step was taken by AMD to focus the RX 7000 and above drivers on stability following the mass crashes in May 2025 on the RX 7000 and 9000 Series.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is the last step before the 5000 and 6000 Series officially reach EOS, likely around 2026.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3liufm48zfyf1.png?width=1761&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2f966bb2faeb6ce14476c59902917d56c362af0\n\n\n\nIt's a shame the 6000 Series is also affected by this shift. Its performance is still capable of handling the onslaught of unoptimized games this year.",

To focus on optimizing and delivering new and improved technologies for the latest GPUs, AMD Software Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 is placing Radeon RX 5000 and RX 6000 series graphics cards (RDNA 1 and RDNA 2) into maintenance mode.

I've been wanting to build something like this for a long time but LED ring fans were expensive back in the day, especially in Portal colours. \n\nWhen ARGB became a thing, the price of the fans fell, and crucially, the colours became customizable.\n\nThe miniature Portal figurines I got from AliExpress, three turrets and a companion cube. Sadly the Glados Arm from Portal 2 wouldn't fit so I had to pass on that one.\n\nStill, I'm glad I themed it up, it didn't cost too much, just needed a bit of planning to make sure that every component was black or white. \n\nWhat do you guys think?

    "title": "I froze Intel’s Arc B580 to 3350 MHz. It loved it.",
    "selftext": "So, I took a Maxsun B580 iCraft and ran it like it owed me money. Using a 3D printed mount for an LGA1156 CPU water block, I ran automotive coolant through it sitting at around –15C, and pushed voltage from 25mV all the way up to 70 mV. Anything past 60 bounced it off the power limit, but 50–55 was the sweet spot, clean scaling, no throttling, no driver tantrums. Power limit stayed maxed at 120 and core +300. It took me a long time to dial it in, but once I did she was one happy Arc.\n\nStock clock is 2850 MHz. Under ice it held 3316 MHz sustained, +466 on the core. That's a 16% uplift! While load temps hovered around 20C. It actually set the top 4 graphics score for the B580 on Time Spy, and top overall. Briefly hitting 3350 MHz during the run.\n\nThen the coolant started warming up before I could even start the game runs, it takes 48 hours to re-chill, and by the time I hit Forza, the loop was half slush, half soup.\n\nIt still pulled 16 percent average uplift in games, matching the 16 percent clock uplift.\n\nCyberpunk 107 - 120\n\nForza 5 158 - 174\n\nMHW 60 - 69\n\nThis was all on a stock card, no BIOS or any Voltage mods.\n\nAfter the initial 1.5 hours of tuning it took me to get there, the card never freaked out, no crashes or black screens... just quiet, consistent scaling. (Unlike Nvidia, Intel doesn't just crash the driver, the whole system restarts... annoying) I didn’t expect Intel Arc to like the cold this much, especially after my last discovery with AMD.\n\nI think there’s still headroom left, contact wasn’t perfect, and the coolant was becoming a warm bath mid run. I will definitely have to give this thing another go... maybe in transmission fluid next time.\n\nThere is a video if you want to see the excitement.

    "selftext": "I’ve always preferred using an external monitor directly in front of me, with my MacBook Pro on a stand to the left as a secondary screen.\n\nRecently, I noticed some people placing their laptop directly in front of their external monitor and working like that. Why do they do it? Is it more comfortable?\n\nThe only clear advantage I see is that you can easily use the built-in keyboard and trackpad without needing external peripherals.\n\nAre there other benefits to this setup that I’m missing?\n\n**UPDATE**:\n\nThe problem is: I spend more time working at home than outside, and putting an external monitor behind the laptop usually means it’s not at eye level. Which can put strain to your neck and eyes.\n\nWould it be better to:\n\n* Raise the external monitor so its top edge aligns with eye level, or\n* Place the external monitor to the left and keep the MacBook’s internal screen as the main display?\n\nWhich setup works best ergonomically? Or maybe is there a better alternative? Perhaps buy smaller external monitor?\n\nIt is such a waste to not use the delivered Macbook Pro's keyboard and trackpad and sometimes not utilizing the webcam when opting for external monitor being the main driver.",

    "selftext": "I’ve always preferred using an external monitor directly in front of me, with my MacBook Pro on a stand to the left as a secondary screen.\n\nRecently, I noticed some people placing their laptop directly in front of their external monitor and working like that. Why do they do it? Is it more comfortable?\n\nThe only clear advantage I see is that you can easily use the built-in keyboard and trackpad without needing external peripherals.\n\nAre there other benefits to this setup that I’m missing?\n\n**UPDATE**:\n\nThe problem is: I spend more time working at home than outside, and putting an external monitor behind the laptop usually means it’s not at eye level. Which can put strain to your neck and eyes.\n\nWould it be better to:\n\n* Raise the external monitor so its top edge aligns with eye level, or\n* Place the external monitor to the left and keep the MacBook’s internal screen as the main display?\n\nWhich setup works best ergonomically? Or maybe is there a better alternative? Perhaps buy smaller external monitor?\n\nIt is such a waste to not use the delivered Macbook Pro's keyboard and trackpad and sometimes not utilizing the webcam when opting for external monitor being the main driver.",

    "selftext": "I’ve always preferred using an external monitor directly in front of me, with my MacBook Pro on a stand to the left as a secondary screen.\n\nRecently, I noticed some people placing their laptop directly in front of their external monitor and working like that. Why do they do it? Is it more comfortable?\n\nThe only clear advantage I see is that you can easily use the built-in keyboard and trackpad without needing external peripherals.\n\nAre there other benefits to this setup that I’m missing?\n\n**UPDATE**:\n\nThe problem is: I spend more time working at home than outside, and putting an external monitor behind the laptop usually means it’s not at eye level. Which can put strain to your neck and eyes.\n\nWould it be better to:\n\n* Raise the external monitor so its top edge aligns with eye level, or\n* Place the external monitor to the left and keep the MacBook’s internal screen as the main display?\n\nWhich setup works best ergonomically? Or maybe is there a better alternative? Perhaps buy smaller external monitor?\n\nIt is such a waste to not use the delivered Macbook Pro's keyboard and trackpad and sometimes not utilizing the webcam when opting for external monitor being the main driver.",

The funny color difference next to the PC is actually where there is a cut in the counter. I had to cut the right section off to fit it in my previous apartment, but now with more space I put that piece back on top of the alex drawer and it stays stationary when I raise the desk.",

    "title": "thoughts and reviews of some light tactile switches",
    "selftext": "hey yall!\n\nfirst time posting in literal years! i wanted to share thoughts about the slew of light tactile switches that have come onto the market this year. there have, of course, been light tactile switch offerings in the past, but i didn't buy those, so i won't be talking about them lol\n\nfor some context, i've always enjoyed mx browns and pretty much use that as the base for all light tactile switches to compare against. i also have been using pewter switches, gateron cap browns, mode signals, and ttc gold v2s (lol they're somehow bad but good to me idk) as some of the other light tactile switches i rotate through (for better or for worse). on top of that, i enjoy the 45g topre boards (hhkb2, fc660c, rf tkl, and cm novatouch (rip)). so even though these aren't all the light tactile switches i have experience in, for the sake of this post, they are my points of reference.  \n\n'light tactile' is also a hard to pin kind of description because it can mean certain things to different people. so for the purposes of this post, when i say light tactile, what i mean specifically is that a) the bottom out weight is typically in the 50-60g range AND b) the tactile bump is small, a 'p' or 'b' shaped bump depending on when and where the tactility starts. some people only refer to one or the other, so this is what i'm basing my thoughts on. \n\nthe switches i'll be writing about will have quick and dirty typing videos taken with an iphone 15 (and posted on imgur) so this is a big ass disclaimer that they haven't been recorded for any scientific consistencies or best audio/environment considerations or to even compare the switches to each other, specifically. they're just snapshots of how they sound inside the boards i've installed them in so ymmv. they may wildly differ in sound and feel to you on your boards. so just fyi, please and thanks.\n\nalso, i paid with all of these with my own money and am just a hobbyist returning to the community with thoughts on new switches that's making keebs fun again for me.\n\nhmx bleeds and bruises\n\n>these are basically twins with nary a difference between them save for .3mm of travel, at least according to milktooth's website. they are fun to type on. they're light and they sound bright and clacky. they're my first foray into using hmx switches (since up to this point they've only had linears) and i think that they are great intros to both hmx and/or to light tactile switches. they're lighter in weight than mx browns but they don't suffer for it. they are enjoyable to get into a long typing session (and fast too! the bruises i type in jumped to 160wpm for the 30sec typing test without even meaning to!). i pretty much immediately put them onto boards as soon as i got them and they have yet to disappoint. i co-sign a lot of the reviews these have gotten and i think deserve a bit of their hype. i enjoy how gentle the tactile bump is because i typically like to feel just enough friction when i'm typing but without how typo-prone i get with linears, even after i've gotten used to the board. overall, solid sets of switches and i recommend them for their feel, sound, and price point. at time of writing, on milktooth's site, they're both $0.42/each, so $4.20 for 10pcs. i find this price reasonable. the naming and color scheme are also quite clever so i would def give them points for that.\n\n>[hmx bleeds typing sounds on neo ergo](https://imgur.com/XGOIh6z) (aluminum case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\n>[hmx bruises typing sounds on mode 2022 sonnet](https://imgur.com/XyaAFlJ) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, top mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nhmx k01 \n\n>these and the akko bittersweets are the closest to mx browns by feel out of all the switches on this lineup and for that i quite enjoy them. they're a good pick for those who want a 'better' and 'more refined' version of an mx brown (no mods required, smooth, no scratchiness, etc -- even tho tbf, cherry has upped their game in their mx2a or hyperglides). i like the characteristics of mx browns but for those who might not want the effort involved in 'improving' on them, k01s are nice out of the box. the sound is clackier than mx browns to me, unsurprising of hmx's signature sound profile. at time of writing, on milktooth's website, they go for $0.35/each which is a pretty good value overall, definitely cheaper than bleeds and bruises or mx browns ($0.40/each on milktooth, but you may have better luck elsewhere. omnitype for example has them for $0.35/each but they come in packages of 35pcs instead of 10pcs). \n\n>[hmx k01 typing sounds on mode tempo](https://imgur.com/6rEOJY0) (aluminum case, copper plate, copper weight, gasket mount, no foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nakko bittersweets\n\n>i was most fascinated with these because of a few things. they are a departure in sound from hmx, promising a subtler and thockier sound profile. according to akko's website, not only are they the tactile counterpart to akko rosewoods (thocky linears), they also describe its name based on the sound and feel that someone might feel about them: \"[This bump is light that it might sometimes go unnoticed, producing a “bittersweet” mixed impression./The sound and feel might be “bitter” for some, yet “sweet” for others.](https://en.akkogear.com/product/bittersweet-switch-lubed/)\" which i thought was pretty neat as i'm sure there are people who would feel that way about them. they are comfortable and they are flatter in sound in the polygon-7 but in a pleasant way. overall, i'm getting good mileage out of them and would find them an easy rec for their value. i know there are akko cilantros that many people enjoy because of its stronger tactility and lighter weight, but i think bittersweets are more for me because of the smaller bump -- but disclaimer, i do not have akko cilantros and have never felt them. but based on reading comments, they feel like they're a gentler version of the cilantros. at time of writing, they're $15 for 45pcs or $0.33/each on amazon, which is what i paid. the akko website has 90pcs for $28 or $0.31/each. \n\n>[akko bittersweet typing sounds on daringrun polygon-7](https://imgur.com/2FVf4fh) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, gasket mount, plate foam, mda profile pbt keycaps)\n\ngateron mini i and gateron weightlessness\n\n>got these from the ikasaya closeout sale and i'd heard decent things about them so i thought i'd give them a try. the differences at least on the ikasaya website lists weightlessness as having a \"light to medium bump\" whereas mini i has a \"gentle tactile bump.\" i think if bleeds/bruises are twin sisters, then these are siblings close in age. the difference between them is that the weightlessness's tactile bump is a smidgen more pronounced and bounces back a bit more noticeably, for me, than the mini i. but that's when i'm taking the time to press down on them. for regular typing, the differences are negligible. overall, their typing experiences are quite pleasant and fall in line nicely with the rest of the switches i've mentioned here. at time of writing, from the ikasaya closeout sale, i got the gateron mini i for $37.50 for 90 switches, so about $0.42/each. in other places, they go for $0.60/each or $6 for 10pcs at milktooth and $10.80 for 18pcs at kineticlabs. as for the weightlessness, they were $40.10 for 90 switches, so about $0.45/each. on amazon, they go for $23.99 for 35pcs, so $0.69/each which is not as budget friendly as the other options here, though it does show a 10% coupon upon purchase. milktooth right now has a sale on them for $5.50 for 10pcs so $0.55/each. lumekeebs also offers the same $0.55/each. respectable price point at the discount, but i don't know if they're worth it above that.\n\n>[gateron mini i typing sounds on monsgeek mg75w](https://imgur.com/96YsEx6) (plastic case and plate, tray mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)  \n[gateron weightlessness typing sounds on keychron v1 max](https://imgur.com/AqW3JB2) (plastic case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, osa profile pbt keycaps)\n\n[typing sounds playlist link](https://imgur.com/a/light-tactile-switches-typing-sounds-N1VjrJg) (imgur album)\n\nif i were to order them in light tactility in the context of mx browns as my center, then it goes as follows: hmx bleeds/bruises, akko bittersweets, mx browns, hmx k01, gateron mini i, gateron weightlessness. \n\nin sum, i'm quite satisfied with this cohort of light tactiles. these switches are great out of the box, need no modification, and are great switches for those who want to try them out as well as for those who already enjoy light tactiles. i feel good recommending them, but of course, your experiences and preferences are your own and up to your own curation and determination. i'm a happy typist with these switches and glad that the rest of my light tactile collection have good company. i look forward to rotating them with each other and on different boards than how they're configured at the moment but for now, i'm enjoying how each one feels on the boards i've chosen for them. \n\nfeel free to talk about your experiences or suggestions of other light tactiles you enjoy as well as ask questions or chat about these. thanks a bunch for reading! \n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share this QMK add-on code I just finished with like-minded hobbyists, in case anyone else might enjoy it.\n\n\"Sticky combo\" allows you to perform fast layer moves using easy-to-press keys without having to reassign them to become permanent fn keys.\n\nIntegration example: I configured Space to trigger a layer move to fn1 while Left Control is held, and releasing Left Control undoes my layer move.   \n  \nAll the files, instructions and detailed explanations are in this folder's [readme.md](http://readme.md), including gif demos and a reference to a commit which integrates all the code to an existing QMK config: [https://github.com/NormanJP/share\\_qmk\\_sticky\\_combo\\_API/tree/Share\\_API/sticky\\_combo\\_lib](https://github.com/NormanJP/share_qmk_sticky_combo_API/tree/Share_API/sticky_combo_lib)\n\nI hope this helps someone else's typing experience like it's been improving mine!",

Was using the Glove80 up until I received the Imprint. While I found the Glove80 to be a great keyboard, there were just a few missing features that I wanted, like hot-swappable switches, MX switches, and the integrated trackballs.\n\nInstalled Durock Ice King switches and clear polycarbonate keycaps. Replaced the default black trackballs with Perixx PeriPro-303 purple and green trackballs. I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

High St., Dublin, OH 43017)  \nDiscord: [Ohio MK](https://discord.gg/YmPypPj)\n\nWe've been in a bit of a scramble since our previous venue shut down, but thankfully we were able to pull something together before the end of the year!\n\n**No tickets are required**, thanks to the library having a free space for us to use. However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup. The library was recently remodeled, and there is also plenty of (free) garage parking next to it.\n\nLooking forward to folks coming out!  \n  \nAlso, thanks yet again to [u/outragedpudding](https://www.reddit.com/user/outragedpudding/) for designing a fabulous [banner](http://i.imgur.com/cpqlgsZ.jpg)!",

Interchanged the switches and that made it better for maybe a couple days and then back to the faulty behavior. since i was out of warranty there is was nothing for me to do in that department. My dad saw my frustration and gave me his keyboard since his work barely needs him to use a computer barely if at all.\n\nI brushed it off as dumb luck and moved on, last month the warranty expired on the new one and low and behold the second keyboard has found the same fate.\n\nOut of desperation, i soldered the switches to the PCB and that worked for a bit but after about 10 days i find myself back on square-one.\n\nI didn't want this to be rant on Keychron but it is very frustrating, especially given how expensive the keyboards are, about 9500 INR.\n\nAlso, would like to disclose I do not have any conflict of interest, meagerly an under-satisfied customer who was very enthusiastic for his new keyboard :( ",

    "title": "My first full size keyboard - Chilkey ND104",
    "selftext": "**disclaimer:** this keyboard was sent to me by Chilkey as a gift (selected from Chilkey keyboard owners), but I was not paid in any way for the review.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe box design looks similar to my Chilkey Slice75 HE, and in my opinion, it's one of the coolest-looking ones out there.  \nThe packaging itself is fairly minimal - it didn’t even include a keycap puller like the one that came with my Chilkey Slice75 HE (though that probably depends on the order). Inside, you'll find the receiver, a Type-C cable, a storage box, elastic bars, and some screws.\n\nThat said, I *really* like the included cable. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels soft and pleasant to the touch - honestly the best cable I've received with any keyboard so far.\n\n# Specs\n\nEverything here feels top-tier: a full aluminum case (weighing around 2.3 kg, pretty hefty!), clean double-shot PBT keycaps, gasket-mount, tri-mode connectivity. There are also several color options available and two switch choices, I got the one with WS Breezes.\n\nOne of the main \"gimmicks\" of this keyboard is built-in calculator - which I actually find surprisingly useful. It's nice having it right next to me for quick calculations. If you don't need the calculator, you can swap it out for a clock, weather display, or even a custom image/gif of your liking.\n\nThere's also a small storage box that can replace six keys near the \"Home\" cluster, though personally I couldn't really find a practical use for it.\n\n# Software\n\nThe keyboard is VIA-compatible, and there's also a simple web-based software with RGB, screen settings, key mapping, macro configuration, but nothing really special.\n\n# Support\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with my interaction with the support team.\n\nI had a few minor firmware improvement suggestions, and honestly didn't expect much when I posted about them in the Chilkey discord server. To my surprise, they responded the same day, saying that they contacted the developer team - and that the feature would be added in the next firmware update.\n\n# Experience\n\nAs my first full-size premium keyboard, I didn’t expect the extra keys to be this useful. It took me a couple of hours, though, to get used to the layout - which probably makes sense, considering I've only used keyboards about 1.5-2x smaller for the past decade =)\n\nThe numpad became super convenient for daily work, and also comes in handy typing long number sequences, 2FA codes, and similar stuff. Now I usually switch between the ND104 and my Slice75 HE for work and gaming. The rapid trigger functionality is fantastic for games (especially in rhythm ones like osu!), but it doesn't quite match the heavenly typing feel of the ND104.\n\nHonestly, I often find myself typing on it, seeking for something to do, just for fun - the addiction is real :D\n\n**TL;DR**  \nThis is a very solid, well-built full-size keyboard, and I'm really happy I got the chance to experience it myself.",

Let's do that.\" So, here I am. I'm only giving this review, though, because I'm in love with this keyboard. It's... so pretty, I can't even.\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nAs baby's first keyboard, this feels... *amazing* and it sounds really nice. I don't know if it's \"clacky\" or \"thocky\" as I don't know how to tell the difference, but it sounds really nice and it's not too loud. I might go in and change out their switches for silent switches if it ends up bothering people in my household while they try to sleep, but so far it seems to be okay.\n\nThe keys feel really soft and smooth somehow and I just didn't expect that. I also really like this moa profile style, I'm finding it a lot more comfortable to type on than the typical profile. \n\nThe case really is wood. It's a heavy af keyboard. As this is my first keyboard and it cost me my entire leg (it's fine, really), I'm a little too nervous to take it apart and modify it myself. But right now? I think it feels and sounds great as stock. There's no rattling, I also think I prefer that it doesn't flex when I type (I'm used to typing on laptops). The charm it comes with is also real wood, but I noticed that it's two halves glued together, and I'm not sure why they did that. Maybe it was to hollow out the centre to keep it light? No idea. But there's a pretty obvious seam along the side so I know it was glued together.\n\nAnyway, I'm a huge fan! It's so pretty, it feels nice to type on, it sounds nice. I bought this thinking it wouldn't have a backlight yet low and behold! The keycaps also don't shine through.\n\nIt's shockingly durable... My dog, I don't know why he did this, but he saw my keyboard and he literally pulled it off my desk by the charm and it crashed hard onto my wooden floor, keycaps down. Everyone thought I fell because of how loud the bang was, like damn this is a heavy and solid keyboard. \n\nAnyway, I was convinced my dog broke it. There were no lights or anything. I typed on it, and it typed but the lights still wouldn't come on so I was like \"great, the RPG is gone, there's no way they'll accept a return for this.\"\n\nFortunately, the RGB wasn't gone. I thought to test the FN+H key to see if the keyboard would turn back on and... it did! There's nothing wrong with the keyboard. No broken keycaps, no chipped piece on the case, no typing issues, no RPG issues, nothing. (Though... maybe this is why my dongle is inconsistent? I'm not sure, actually, hm.) I'm  literally stunned. \n\nAlso, I removed a switch to see if it really was hot swappable. It was. Though as my first time removing a switch, it was terrifying. But now... I hold the power of customisation! If I want it at least.\n\n   \n**CONS**\n\nIt's a very, very tall keyboard. It seems to be okay for me because I generally keep my keyboard lower so my hands rest down, but I can see someone who has their keyboard higher needing an wrist rest.\n\nThe biggest con for me is that the power button is under the caps lock, so any time I want to turn it on or off I'll have to remove the keycap. It fortunately goes to sleep on its own without being typed on for a while, but I prefer to manually to turn it off. I'm not going to, though, because I'm l a z y.\n\nBeing new to the 65% of the layout, I don't know what some of the keys are... and every time I want to use the tilde, I accidentally hit the escape key, lol! I don't think there's a tilde? Not sure. I know I almost never use the keys on the right side (the four keys above the right arrow), so I haven't felt compelled to look up a guide.\n\nSometimes, the dongle doesn't want to work. I've found that bluetooth is way more reliable on this keyboard. (Though this might be my dog's fault??)\n\nLastly, there's really no flex despite there being a gasket. I don't think I personally find that an issue. Probably because I've never experienced a flexible gasket keyboard before, so who knows. Maybe I'm missing out. I like how firm it is, though.\n\n\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\nIt's very, very heavy. I don't know if it's because of the wood, or if they added weights, or what. I don't know if I like how heavy this keyboard is. In a way it feels nice, but in another way... \n\nI'm learning Japanese, which is also why I got this keyboard. I'm hoping to see if I download Japanese keyboard on my computer, that I'll be able to type in Japanese more easily by seeing the hiragana on the keyboard. I'm putting this as neutral, though, since I don't know if it'll work that way yet and if ka will really type ka, for example or if it's totally random.\n\n  \n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really love this keyboard. It's pretty and fairly comfortable to type on. I like the sound and feel, too. It's also customisable which is nice. The cons are pretty minimal, I think. As my first mechanical keyboard, I think it's a great find. \n\nAlso, if you don't want the keyboard itself but you like the keycaps, they have the keycaps for sale on their own on their website.

    "selftext": "https://reddit.com/link/1ohqnll/video/3yg1upjhypxf1/player\n\nI made my first switch customization to my ZSA Moonlander Mark 1, and I love it. I have been using the same Cherry MX Browns that the keyboard came with for over a year, and at one point, I added O-rings to make it quieter. Then I bought some silent linear switches from Milktooth and installed them today. Not only is the backlighting a lot brighter, but they sound and feel amazing. I left the old tactile switches on the keys that have important shortcuts/macros that I don't want to accidentally press, though.\n\n  \nI will say, I have to get used to typing on linear keys since my accuracy is taking a hit. However, if I type more softly, then it works just fine. If anyone is curious, I bought the silent frozen switches from a vendor called Milktooth. They seem to be good, though the switches were shipped in a plastic bag. Thankfully, no pins were bent. Thanks to everyone who suggested where to buy my first switches!",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "thoughts and reviews of some light tactile switches",
    "selftext": "hey yall!\n\nfirst time posting in literal years! i wanted to share thoughts about the slew of light tactile switches that have come onto the market this year. there have, of course, been light tactile switch offerings in the past, but i didn't buy those, so i won't be talking about them lol\n\nfor some context, i've always enjoyed mx browns and pretty much use that as the base for all light tactile switches to compare against. i also have been using pewter switches, gateron cap browns, mode signals, and ttc gold v2s (lol they're somehow bad but good to me idk) as some of the other light tactile switches i rotate through (for better or for worse). on top of that, i enjoy the 45g topre boards (hhkb2, fc660c, rf tkl, and cm novatouch (rip)). so even though these aren't all the light tactile switches i have experience in, for the sake of this post, they are my points of reference.  \n\n'light tactile' is also a hard to pin kind of description because it can mean certain things to different people. so for the purposes of this post, when i say light tactile, what i mean specifically is that a) the bottom out weight is typically in the 50-60g range AND b) the tactile bump is small, a 'p' or 'b' shaped bump depending on when and where the tactility starts. some people only refer to one or the other, so this is what i'm basing my thoughts on. \n\nthe switches i'll be writing about will have quick and dirty typing videos taken with an iphone 15 (and posted on imgur) so this is a big ass disclaimer that they haven't been recorded for any scientific consistencies or best audio/environment considerations or to even compare the switches to each other, specifically. they're just snapshots of how they sound inside the boards i've installed them in so ymmv. they may wildly differ in sound and feel to you on your boards. so just fyi, please and thanks.\n\nalso, i paid with all of these with my own money and am just a hobbyist returning to the community with thoughts on new switches that's making keebs fun again for me.\n\nhmx bleeds and bruises\n\n>these are basically twins with nary a difference between them save for .3mm of travel, at least according to milktooth's website. they are fun to type on. they're light and they sound bright and clacky. they're my first foray into using hmx switches (since up to this point they've only had linears) and i think that they are great intros to both hmx and/or to light tactile switches. they're lighter in weight than mx browns but they don't suffer for it. they are enjoyable to get into a long typing session (and fast too! the bruises i type in jumped to 160wpm for the 30sec typing test without even meaning to!). i pretty much immediately put them onto boards as soon as i got them and they have yet to disappoint. i co-sign a lot of the reviews these have gotten and i think deserve a bit of their hype. i enjoy how gentle the tactile bump is because i typically like to feel just enough friction when i'm typing but without how typo-prone i get with linears, even after i've gotten used to the board. overall, solid sets of switches and i recommend them for their feel, sound, and price point. at time of writing, on milktooth's site, they're both $0.42/each, so $4.20 for 10pcs. i find this price reasonable. the naming and color scheme are also quite clever so i would def give them points for that.\n\n>[hmx bleeds typing sounds on neo ergo](https://imgur.com/XGOIh6z) (aluminum case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\n>[hmx bruises typing sounds on mode 2022 sonnet](https://imgur.com/XyaAFlJ) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, top mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nhmx k01 \n\n>these and the akko bittersweets are the closest to mx browns by feel out of all the switches on this lineup and for that i quite enjoy them. they're a good pick for those who want a 'better' and 'more refined' version of an mx brown (no mods required, smooth, no scratchiness, etc -- even tho tbf, cherry has upped their game in their mx2a or hyperglides). i like the characteristics of mx browns but for those who might not want the effort involved in 'improving' on them, k01s are nice out of the box. the sound is clackier than mx browns to me, unsurprising of hmx's signature sound profile. at time of writing, on milktooth's website, they go for $0.35/each which is a pretty good value overall, definitely cheaper than bleeds and bruises or mx browns ($0.40/each on milktooth, but you may have better luck elsewhere. omnitype for example has them for $0.35/each but they come in packages of 35pcs instead of 10pcs). \n\n>[hmx k01 typing sounds on mode tempo](https://imgur.com/6rEOJY0) (aluminum case, copper plate, copper weight, gasket mount, no foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nakko bittersweets\n\n>i was most fascinated with these because of a few things. they are a departure in sound from hmx, promising a subtler and thockier sound profile. according to akko's website, not only are they the tactile counterpart to akko rosewoods (thocky linears), they also describe its name based on the sound and feel that someone might feel about them: \"[This bump is light that it might sometimes go unnoticed, producing a “bittersweet” mixed impression./The sound and feel might be “bitter” for some, yet “sweet” for others.](https://en.akkogear.com/product/bittersweet-switch-lubed/)\" which i thought was pretty neat as i'm sure there are people who would feel that way about them. they are comfortable and they are flatter in sound in the polygon-7 but in a pleasant way. overall, i'm getting good mileage out of them and would find them an easy rec for their value. i know there are akko cilantros that many people enjoy because of its stronger tactility and lighter weight, but i think bittersweets are more for me because of the smaller bump -- but disclaimer, i do not have akko cilantros and have never felt them. but based on reading comments, they feel like they're a gentler version of the cilantros. at time of writing, they're $15 for 45pcs or $0.33/each on amazon, which is what i paid. the akko website has 90pcs for $28 or $0.31/each. \n\n>[akko bittersweet typing sounds on daringrun polygon-7](https://imgur.com/2FVf4fh) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, gasket mount, plate foam, mda profile pbt keycaps)\n\ngateron mini i and gateron weightlessness\n\n>got these from the ikasaya closeout sale and i'd heard decent things about them so i thought i'd give them a try. the differences at least on the ikasaya website lists weightlessness as having a \"light to medium bump\" whereas mini i has a \"gentle tactile bump.\" i think if bleeds/bruises are twin sisters, then these are siblings close in age. the difference between them is that the weightlessness's tactile bump is a smidgen more pronounced and bounces back a bit more noticeably, for me, than the mini i. but that's when i'm taking the time to press down on them. for regular typing, the differences are negligible. overall, their typing experiences are quite pleasant and fall in line nicely with the rest of the switches i've mentioned here. at time of writing, from the ikasaya closeout sale, i got the gateron mini i for $37.50 for 90 switches, so about $0.42/each. in other places, they go for $0.60/each or $6 for 10pcs at milktooth and $10.80 for 18pcs at kineticlabs. as for the weightlessness, they were $40.10 for 90 switches, so about $0.45/each. on amazon, they go for $23.99 for 35pcs, so $0.69/each which is not as budget friendly as the other options here, though it does show a 10% coupon upon purchase. milktooth right now has a sale on them for $5.50 for 10pcs so $0.55/each. lumekeebs also offers the same $0.55/each. respectable price point at the discount, but i don't know if they're worth it above that.\n\n>[gateron mini i typing sounds on monsgeek mg75w](https://imgur.com/96YsEx6) (plastic case and plate, tray mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)  \n[gateron weightlessness typing sounds on keychron v1 max](https://imgur.com/AqW3JB2) (plastic case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, osa profile pbt keycaps)\n\n[typing sounds playlist link](https://imgur.com/a/light-tactile-switches-typing-sounds-N1VjrJg) (imgur album)\n\nif i were to order them in light tactility in the context of mx browns as my center, then it goes as follows: hmx bleeds/bruises, akko bittersweets, mx browns, hmx k01, gateron mini i, gateron weightlessness. \n\nin sum, i'm quite satisfied with this cohort of light tactiles. these switches are great out of the box, need no modification, and are great switches for those who want to try them out as well as for those who already enjoy light tactiles. i feel good recommending them, but of course, your experiences and preferences are your own and up to your own curation and determination. i'm a happy typist with these switches and glad that the rest of my light tactile collection have good company. i look forward to rotating them with each other and on different boards than how they're configured at the moment but for now, i'm enjoying how each one feels on the boards i've chosen for them. \n\nfeel free to talk about your experiences or suggestions of other light tactiles you enjoy as well as ask questions or chat about these. thanks a bunch for reading! \n\n",

I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

    "selftext": "**Need help choosing between Alienware AW2725DF vs Zowie XL2546X+ (for PUBG only)**\n\n\n\nHey guys,\n\nI could really use some advice here.\n\n\n\nRight now I’m using a 165Hz, 27-inch VA panel monitor, and I only play PUBG Battlegrounds — literally nothing else. The problem is, I can clearly see screen tearing while playing, and it’s driving me insane.\n\n\n\nAfter a ton of research, I finally found the monitor I thought was perfect for me — the Dell Alienware AW2725DF. But right before pulling the trigger, I came across another option that threw me off: the BenQ Zowie XL2546X+. It claims to completely eliminate screen tearing thanks to DyAc 2 and all that esports tech.\n\n\n\nSo now I’m stuck.\n\nAs someone who only plays PUBG and considers myself a decent player, which one should I go for?\n\n\n\nIf we do a Zowie vs Alienware comparison specifically for PUBG, which one comes out on top?\n\nCan’t the Alienware handle tearing just as well as the Zowie, or is Zowie really that much better for competitive play?\n\n\n\nWould really appreciate any insights from people who’ve used either of these, especially PUBG players.",

Single cable USB-C 60+ watt for Mac laptop\n6. No movies or creative design work.\n\nI currently have an Apple Studio Display 5k 60hz. I absolutely love it for the high DPI, decent speakers, decent webcam, and sleek design. Looks professional on my desk without the gamer aesthetic and minimal cable clutter.\n\nMy PC has a Thunderbolt passthrough so I can game on it with my Ryzen 9800X3D + Radeon 9070XT desktop.\n\nDownside is I can't connect my consoles via HDMI and the high resolution and low refresh are not ideal for games. In BF6 my current game I'm getting 50-100 FPS on low in very demanding maps so I'm force to turn on FRS4 and use upscaling tricks to make the game playable. This is not ideal and I think I'd do better with a less demanding resolution. I'm also interested in the smoothness of higher refresh rate screens.\n\nI'd like to connect 1-2 game consoles at a time. I'd like the monitor to be robust and I'm worried about burn in and the screen getting scratched, I really like the glass on the Apple monitor. I've had problems in the past with wife/kids touching/knocking things into matte LCD screens and scratching the screen. This has happened twice!\n\nI was eyeing the Asus XG27ACDNG ROG Strix 26.5. Would you go with this or is there a better option? I'd like to keep this around $700-800 USD but I can do higher if someone has a perfect recommendation. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Seeking a slightly curbed, or not the aggressive 1800R screen. I currently have 2 27\" monitors at a slight angled from each other and it's time to move to one solution. I believe the 34\" is the smaller of the side of this ledger as I also don't want to spend $1K on a monitor. \n\nWhere have folks found good reviews of such options? Again, it seems most vendors (e.g. Samsung, ASUS, etc) are heavily dominated to the gaming market and I need to cut through that and find a clear, concise monitor for hours of reading each day.\n\nI believe the LG34WQ73A-B may meet a lot of my criteria, at least on paper (i.e. non-aggressive curve of 3800R, inexpensive, height adjustable, should be good with text). Trouble is, I can't find very many non AI-created YouTube commercial reviews of this monitor. \n\nI may just have to settle a safe Samsung S34C502GAN, which is basically a 34\" flat monitor since I really don't want big curve for working from home. A little would be nice since my two 27\" monitors are slightly angled in for better reading. \n\nAgain, curious if any current LG users are running this 34WQ73A-B or something similar with a slight curve and nothing aggressive.

Also, i am a serious MMO veteran so perhaps I will try an MMO every now and then, but time is not there to invest.\n\nSo, my research led me to a preference on OLED with Glossy panels since color accuracy is important to me, peak brightness is not a terrible issue. But I am not an expert!\n\n My budget is capped around 700€-750€ and now after some research I rly like the following monitors:\n\n1.\t**Dell AW2725DF QD-OLED HDR Gaming** (This is my 1st choice I rly like the brand and it has a glossy panel that has high review scores especially on picture accuracy + 360 hz)\n\n2.\t**Asus ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG OLED HDR** ( It is a good package since price is good 590€ in Greece but I do not trust ASUS support and I ve seen some bad reviews for the monitor)\n\n3.\t**LG Ultragear 27GS95QE-B OLED HDR Gaming Monitor 27\"** ( I trust the brand support, but it seems to me that it is mostly placed as console OLED panel and lacks the quality of the Alienware)\n\nI also seen the Samsung G6 but I rly hate the silver colour and overall esthetics but.\n\nAs I said before I am not an expert since I come from a 10-year IPS 60hz panel and my choices consist of 2-3 days of reading reviews and watching videos.\n\nSo, I am turning to you. Could you please provide me with the best option for an OLED display for my build? And if possible, elaborate on that?\n\nThank you in advance !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "AOC Q27G40XMN Dilemma",
    "selftext": "Hey all, grabbed a Q27G40XMN today on sale at Best Buy. It's got a manufactured date of 5/25. I got it set up and I've spent the last hour and a half or so trying to discern if it has the firmware bugs and if so how severe they are.\n\nI *think* it does have the bug, or at least a form of it. As described, when I've enabled displayhdr + strong local dimming at some point and then switched back to SDR + strong local dimming, I can see that the color of the AOC logo on the OSD has slightly shifted hues from orange, to a slight yellow-orange/orange-yellow. The difference is subtle, but noticeable if you are looking for it. \n\nWhat I will say is that I'm curious if this is potentially even a partially fixed firmware version where this bug is much less pronounced. The difference between the bugged state of SDR + strong local dimming and the normal state right after a monitor reset is so subtle that, as far as I've seen, I can literally only notice it on the OSD. I don't know if it's just that I've never had an HDR monitor before, but to me I'm having trouble seeing an issue even though the OSD looks like it's bugged. DisplayHDR looks excellent to me, SDR looks excellent to me, even the bugged state of SDR + strong local dimming looks excellent to me. \n\nMy questions would be this:\n\n1. Is the firmware bug believed to significantly impact the performance DisplayHDR + strong local dimming mode? If so, should it be bad enough that I can notice it with an untrained eye?\n\n2. Does anyone have ideas on ways to test more objectively to see if whatever version of this monitor firmware I have is performing acceptably in actual content and not just on the OSD? The only idea I have so far is to compare some test videos and colors to my only other HDR device, my iPhone, to see if there are any colors that are noticeably washed out on my monitor.\n\nLuckily it's Best Buy, so I should be in a position to easily return the monitor if I end up wanting to. The tough part is, I haven't been able to visibly see any issues outside of the OSD. If I hadn't read up on this issue in detail, I'm not sure that I ever would have noticed it. It's tough to jump straight to boxing it back up and returning it when the only way I can tell there's something wrong is looking at the OSD in the \"bugged\" state. \n\nI'm going to spend a day or so gaming with it and trying to find HDR content to really push a wide range of super bright content through it. Maybe I will come across something that makes it quite clear that there's an issue, and I'll update this if I do. With it being on sale and looking unbelievably good for $250, I think I could live with this version of the issue if the HDR performance doesn't disappoint, so I guess I'll try as much HDR content consumption as I can and see how I feel.\n\nAnyone else had a similar experience?",

    "selftext": "This is an example of how mini led in blackout mode is able to eat up details in very dark scenes. Black spot on crosshair is fully black. Please note that increasing the shadow lightening by only 2 points will bring back the detail.\n\nMy monitor has two dynamic backlight modes. The images in the photo do not reflect how  see the image on the monitor. These are hypertrophied photos taken at 800 ISO and at 50% and 1600 ISO at 100% brightness (to even out the brightness level in the photo, at least a little bit). The shutter speed in all photos is 0.8 seconds. Ignore the blurriness due to the tremor.\n\nDimming mode do not produce visible blooming or other artifacts, but could hide some details in near pitch-black scenes. Blooming mode trying focus to brightening every even smallest bright details, which increases brightness overall and don't touch black details. But it produces visible blooming around objects accompanied by inverted blooming.\n\nConclusion: Mini-LED mediocre of keeping details in dark scenes, working in high dimming mode. I can assure you that the details are preserved in the Medium dimming mode, slightly reducing the contrast (it's perfect for low brightness).\n\nThis is not a hate post. Mini-LED backlight monitors has a right to exist and these are literally some of the best monitors that are quite capable of competing with OLED and even surpassing them in other scenarios.",

I'm looking for versatile use with gaming and productivity. I heard text clarity isn't as good on the OLED monitors, but to be honest I've been working on the Alienware for about a year now and notice no issues. Here are my use cases below:\n\n1. Gaming on one monitor\n\n2. Working on both monitors for my job. This would entail coding on the right monitor and probably more coding or documentation open on the left monitor. Sometimes there could be static pages left on screen. I don't see any benefit of an OLED in this case.\n\n3. Side projects on my PC or game development (Unity/Unreal Engine). The only use case I see for an OLED is if I was using Photoshop or Blender on the second monitor for anything while having UE open on the other, but would an OLED make a difference or be worth it in this case? \n\nThank you in advance for the answers.\n",

    "title": "ASUS VG248 won't work on anything but 60 hz?",
    "selftext": "Hey guys. I was wondering if y'all could help me out with a monitor issue I'm having. The short version is exactly what the title says. But to add more detail:\n\nI've had my VG248 for about 3 years now and I've never really had a problem with it. A handful of times it went black while I was using it suddenly but it came right back and it's happened maybe 5 times total in 3 years? It was totally fine yesterday and last night but today I turn it on and it kept cutting out. It wouldn't stay on for more than a few seconds. My second monitor is working just fine and I've had no issues with it at all since this started so I don't think it's my PC.\n\nI updated all my drivers and that did nothing. I unplugged everything, plugged it back in with brand new cables. That helped ... a little bit. The screen still kept going static-y for lack of a better word and it kept cutting out for several seconds at a time.\n\nI turned it off and back on, I unplugged the monitor both from the socket and from the monitor itself, plugged everything back in, issue persisted. I use the same monitor for my PS5 as well so I switched it over, turned that on, it worked flawlessly.\n\nFinally go back to my PC, change the refresh rate from 120 to 100. Nothing. Down to 60 and now it's totally fine.\n\nAnd, again, the entire time this has been going on my secondary monitor has been totally fine. No issues with it at all. It's chugging along as normal.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on what to do or try? 60 hz is brutal so I don't want to be stuck with this for very long and I can't afford a new monitor at the moment and I can't use the secondary one to game on (it's a cheapy little $70 monitor that's not really good for more than Discord, Spotify, and YouTube if I want to put on a video or something while I'm playing something chill) so I'd really like to get this figured out if possible.",

    "selftext": "My setup is currently two 40” Dell monitors placed together horizontally using a standard 2 monitor mount. I’m looking into getting a 57” ultrawide as a setup upgrade. I want to install all 3 together. \n\nThe setup I had in mind is that the 57” ultrawide is my main monitor at the bottom. My current dual 40” monitors get placed immediately on top of that monitor for a 3 monitor set up. I’ve been looking and looking and I can’t seem to find a proper mount that will let me install it like this. I’ve seen several mounts that can hold multiple 57” monitors, but I can’t seem to find a mount that lets me mix in the ultrawide with smaller standard monitors. My current monitors have mounting arms that look like they can be moved and placed on a different pole. Even if I can’t find a proper mount for my specific set up, can I still make it work if I find a big enjoy monitor pole to install my new 57” monitors and then move over my current 40” screens to it?\n\nEDIT: I have a second setup option I’m considering. My 57” ultrawide would be the main monitor and 40” monitors get placed vertically on each side next to the ultrawide. Does a mount that lets me do this exist?",

I have a question i really want to know the answer for it. I know that the hdmi cable only transmit the same frequency as the laptop screen (144hz in this case) and if i want to have more i need a displayport cable but the problem my laptop doesnt have a display port but it does have a thunderbolt port so are the thunderbolt to displayport cables are good and reliable or should i just stick to a good hdmi cable? Any suggestion for monitors and cables will be appreciated and thanks ",

If I try to run a 120hz game, it automatically switches to 1440p with RGB format HDR.\n\nI guess my question is, is that behavior ideal or will I gain any benefit by forcing the device into 1440p at all times?

[P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall.

Trouble is, I can't find very many non AI-created YouTube commercial reviews of this monitor. \n\nI may just have to settle a safe Samsung S34C502GAN, which is basically a 34\" flat monitor since I really don't want big curve for working from home.

I currently have an Alienware 32\" AW3225QF 4K 240Hz (right) and recently bought an ASUS 32\" XG32UCDM 4K 165Hz to use as my second monitor.\n\nMy question: should I return the ASUS on the left and replace it with my old Gigabyte M32U 4K 144Hz IPS monitor or keep it and sell the M32U? I'm looking for versatile use with gaming and productivity. I heard text clarity isn't as good on the OLED monitors, but to be honest I've been working on the Alienware for about a year now and notice no issues. Here are my use cases below:\n\n1. Gaming on one monitor\n\n2. Working on both monitors for my job. This would entail coding on the right monitor and probably more coding or documentation open on the left monitor. Sometimes there could be static pages left on screen. I don't see any benefit of an OLED in this case.\n\n3. Side projects on my PC or game development (Unity/Unreal Engine). The only use case I see for an OLED is if I was using Photoshop or Blender on the second monitor for anything while having UE open on the other, but would an OLED make a difference or be worth it in this case? \n\nThank you in advance for the answers.\n",

Single cable USB-C 60+ watt for Mac laptop\n6. No movies or creative design work.\n\nI currently have an Apple Studio Display 5k 60hz. I absolutely love it for the high DPI, decent speakers, decent webcam, and sleek design. Looks professional on my desk without the gamer aesthetic and minimal cable clutter.\n\nMy PC has a Thunderbolt passthrough so I can game on it with my Ryzen 9800X3D + Radeon 9070XT desktop.\n\nDownside is I can't connect my consoles via HDMI and the high resolution and low refresh are not ideal for games. In BF6 my current game I'm getting 50-100 FPS on low in very demanding maps so I'm force to turn on FRS4 and use upscaling tricks to make the game playable. This is not ideal and I think I'd do better with a less demanding resolution. I'm also interested in the smoothness of higher refresh rate screens.\n\nI'd like to connect 1-2 game consoles at a time. I'd like the monitor to be robust and I'm worried about burn in and the screen getting scratched, I really like the glass on the Apple monitor. I've had problems in the past with wife/kids touching/knocking things into matte LCD screens and scratching the screen. This has happened twice!\n\nI was eyeing the Asus XG27ACDNG ROG Strix 26.5. Would you go with this or is there a better option? I'd like to keep this around $700-800 USD but I can do higher if someone has a perfect recommendation. Thanks!",

Trouble is, I can't find very many non AI-created YouTube commercial reviews of this monitor. \n\nI may just have to settle a safe Samsung S34C502GAN, which is basically a 34\" flat monitor since I really don't want big curve for working from home.

I currently have an Alienware 32\" AW3225QF 4K 240Hz (right) and recently bought an ASUS 32\" XG32UCDM 4K 165Hz to use as my second monitor.\n\nMy question: should I return the ASUS on the left and replace it with my old Gigabyte M32U 4K 144Hz IPS monitor or keep it and sell the M32U? I'm looking for versatile use with gaming and productivity. I heard text clarity isn't as good on the OLED monitors, but to be honest I've been working on the Alienware for about a year now and notice no issues. Here are my use cases below:\n\n1. Gaming on one monitor\n\n2. Working on both monitors for my job. This would entail coding on the right monitor and probably more coding or documentation open on the left monitor. Sometimes there could be static pages left on screen. I don't see any benefit of an OLED in this case.\n\n3. Side projects on my PC or game development (Unity/Unreal Engine). The only use case I see for an OLED is if I was using Photoshop or Blender on the second monitor for anything while having UE open on the other, but would an OLED make a difference or be worth it in this case? \n\nThank you in advance for the answers.\n",

    "title": "A New Study on the Equivalence of Harman OE Target on Modern Test Fixtures, Co-authored by Sean Olive and Dan Clark Audio",
    "selftext": "> Summarized by Qwen.\n\nFor years, the *Harman target*—a frequency response profile derived from extensive double-blind listening tests—has served as a benchmark for “neutral” or preferred headphone sound. Originally defined using a specific GRAS 45CA test fixture equipped with a custom “Welti” pinna and an RA045 (Type 3.3) ear simulator, this target has become widely referenced in both research and product development.\n\nHowever, a critical issue has emerged: many modern labs and manufacturers now use newer test fixtures—such as the **GRAS 45CA-10** (with KB5000 anthropomorphic pinna and RA0402 ear simulator) and the **Brüel & Kjær Type 5128** (featuring a Type 4.3 ear simulator compliant with ITU-T P.57). These fixtures differ acoustically from the original Harman setup, particularly in their **acoustic transfer impedance**, especially below 500 Hz and above 3 kHz. Applying the original Harman target directly to measurements from these newer systems can lead to misinterpretation—and potentially misguided tuning decisions.\n\nIn a new paper presented at the **AES 159th Convention** (October 2025), **Sean Olive** (the architect of the Harman target) and **Dan Clark** address this problem head-on. Their work defines *Harman-equivalent targets* specifically calibrated for the GRAS 45CA-10 and B&K 5128 fixtures, ensuring that headphones tuned to these revised targets will sound subjectively similar to those tuned to the original Harman reference.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe authors measured seven diverse headphones including open-back and closed-back models from Dan Clark Audio, HiFiMan, and Sennheiser—on all three fixtures (original Welti, GRAS 45CA-10, and B&K 5128). Using a straightforward calibration method in Room EQ Wizard (REW), they derived fixture-specific targets by:\n\n1. Measuring each headphone on both the original and new fixtures.\n2. Computing the ratio between responses (e.g., KB5000 / Welti).\n3. Applying this ratio to the original Harman target (phase-conjugated and smoothed) to generate a new, equivalent target.\n\nThis process accounts for the unique acoustic loading and leakage characteristics of each fixture.\n\n## Listening Tests Confirm Validity\n\nTo validate the approach, the team conducted controlled **MUSHRA-style listening tests** with 13 experienced listeners, comparing seven versions of the target:\n\n- The original Harman target (Reference)\n- Fixture-specific targets calibrated per headphone\n- Targets averaged across 7 or 20 headphones\n\nResults were clear: when headphones were equalized to their **fixture-specific, individually calibrated targets**, they sounded **nearly identical** to the original Harman reference. In statistical terms, the **B&K 5128** and **GRAS 45CA-10** targets (calibrated per model) were **not significantly different** from the reference in perceived similarity.\n\nBy contrast, targets derived from **averages across multiple headphones** (e.g., “5128_20”) scored lower—though still within the “very similar” range—highlighting that **individual calibration yields the best match**.\n\nInterestingly, the type of headphone (open vs. closed-back) had minimal impact on results, suggesting the method is robust across designs.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nFor engineers and audiophiles alike, this work resolves a long-standing ambiguity: **you cannot directly apply the classic Harman target to measurements taken on modern fixtures** and expect accurate tuning. Instead, fixture-specific equivalents are needed.\n\nEncouragingly, the differences between targets are often correctable with **simple bass and treble shelving filters**, as most deviations occur in well-defined frequency regions. This opens the door for more consistent, cross-platform headphone evaluation—and more reliable interpretations of published measurements.\n\nWhile the study focused on seven models, the calibration framework is generalizable. Future work may yield standardized correction targets for common fixtures, enabling broader adoption without per-headphone measurement.\n\n## Reference\n\nOlive, S., & Clark, D.

    "title": "Arya Organic…Wow",
    "selftext": "My thoughts on the Arya Organics (I know there’s plenty of reviews etc, but what harm can another do)\n\nI jumped into this hobby about 2 years ago roughly. Through that time, I’ve been through plenty headphones, but the only ones I spent a LOT of time with was 2. The Arya Stealth, and the HD560s. \n\n(Skip further down if you don’t care about the previous stories)\n\nThe Stealths were mind blowing to me, I did have planars before these. The edition xs (felt way too cheap for the 300 mark at the time. The Ananda Nanos (clamped like a vice). So picked up the Arya Stealths for £710, which was their cheapest price at the time. I owned these for 6 months. Every time I put them on, I was astounded at the sound. However, after 2 months, I rarely used them, I didn’t have the time to listen, and didn’t want £700 lying around. So I reluctantly sold them, and decided to pick up the cheaper pair, the HD560s. So I could still enjoy music, without feeling guilty having some premium set collecting dust. And these were fine, for £90, they were great.\n\nRecently however I’m now in a position where I have a lot more free time, and for that reason, I wanted to pick up a higher end headphone again. I was debating between many, but in the end it kept boiling down to the Stealths, which were now £460. But then saw the Organics were just £120 extra as “open-box” from Hifiman. One thing I absolutely hated with the Stealths was how harsh some of the treble was, and at the time I didn’t have EQ. So I was stuck with harsh treble in a few songs I enjoyed other times. Between owning the 560s and Stealths, I did pick up the JDS Element 4 Dac/Amp in preparation for higher end cans in the future, and to play around with EQ. So hearing the Organics had a harsh treble, it didn’t really deter me as I had the capabilities to town it down.\n\nSo now onto the Organics…\n\nLOOKS:\nThese things are absolutely gorgeous! It’s like taking your grandads beautifully varnished wooden table and chairs, and adding a modern touch to it. It makes them stand out and look far more premium than the price suggests (I’m aware they were 1500 odd on release, but on current pricing, the point stands). They feel more premium for this matter. I the one massive negative, is you have to wear them to listen, meaning I can’t just stare at them when in use. \n\nCOMFORT:\nAnyone who’s familiar with the Arya lineup, know that this line of headphones are on the comfier side of the Hifiman brand. They clamp just enough to not feel loose, but not too hard that it feels like the hulk is crushing your skull (Nanos). Yes the pads aren’t the most comfy pads on any headphone, they’re actually the one aspect I don’t like. They don’t feel premium, and the fabric design sometimes catches the odd strand of hair which isn’t pleasant. However changing these means altering the sound, which you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, want to do. The headband is perfect though. Suspended straps are my favourite on headphones, adds a premium feel, look and feels like far less pressure on your head. Not to mention how wide they are, it helps distribute the weight so well.\n\nUNBOXING: \nDead, £5 unboxing experience, but realistically who cares…\n\nSOUND:\nGrand. Exciting. Smooth. \n\nThe 3 words I’d use to describe the sound. Which goes to show how versatile they are. They give off such a ‘grand’ feeling, when you listen to orchestral pieces, it feels like you’re in a theatre listening to a band playing, but like you’re middle row. Not first row where it feels in your face, and not back row that it feels like it’s far away. It’s that perfect middle ground where it’s around you, but so that you can hear everything so cleanly. They’re exciting in the sense that after an orchestral piece, you put on an EDM track, pop or anything in that region, and it feels like you want to get up and just dance, but don’t, as these probably would fall off your head. And then you go for a very vocal focused piece of music, and the smoothness of the voice just glides through your ears. There’s no moment where it’s aggressive (unless it needs to be) or where it holds back. It’s like an electric supercar. You put your foot down, and it picks up straight away, but with no aggression, just picks up and gets going right away. \n\nOnto the specifics:\n\nBASS - Very solid. Definitely stronger than the Arya Stealths. When I had them, the bass was there, but it needed a tad more punch. These add that very subtle punch, where you know it’s bass, but it doesn’t slip into the other frequencies and overthrow them. It’s controlled VERY well. The sub bass is fantastic too. My favourite song to test this is “The Droid Invasion and the Appearance of Darth Maul” from The Phantom Menace. The drums at the start provide that sub bass test and it really shows how it handles it well. Doesn’t get fatiguing, just presents it so smoothly. Not to mention how clear the drums sound, like you can visualise the fabric drum stick hitting against the massive drum. The bass is also quick when needing to be. In many pop songs where there is the common use of bass, or in rap music, it’ll show the bass, and stop it perfectly. It never feels like it over presents itself. They also hold the bass off so well from overpowering the mids. Many headphones either make the bass so minimal that you don’t realise there should be bass, and many push it so hard it dims down the vocals. These control it so so well.\n\nMIDS - I would say the weakest out of the Low, Mid and High ends. Definitely NOT bad, it’s really really great. However when there is consistent bass present, and a lot of higher end or many many instruments playing, the vocals definitely take a seat back. They’re still very clear, but it pushes the instruments forward a bit more. Which isn’t bad at all, and some people may prefer this. It’s more of a preference thing. I certainly don’t mind it, and it’s not something I’m gonna be quickly to go and EQ, but if I was, it’s the first thing I’d play with, just to bring them forward a touch. BUT, when there’s only a low end and vocals, or high end and vocals, they are stunning. They just sound so real and ‘organic’, it’s like having a conversation with David Attenborough, just so nicely spoken and a voice you wish could commentate on your whole life. \n\nHIGHS - Lies were told here, or obviously it’s just down to personal hearing. But these are NOT ‘peaky’ or ‘harsh’. The high end is so well controlled. With the Arya Stealth, I absolutely could not listen to Nightcall - Kavinsky from Drive. The chorus of the song was so harsh I literally couldn’t listen to it. So the first song I wanted to try was that, and on these I could listen to the entire song with no issues. They have just enough brightness to make everything sound clean and clear, but not too much that it comes across as piercing during songs. Same with Time - Pink Floyd. The start with all the clocks can be very piercing with poorly controlled highs, but it’s like the headphones actively know it’s going to sound harsh and presents them just a tone down so that you don’t have to turn the volume down or skip forward. It was my one worry with these, and although EQ is an option, I did want to enjoy them stock for as long as possible. Which I’m ecstatic with the fact I can.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE - Wide, but not artificially wide, just naturally wide. Like I said with the orchestral hall and being “grand”. It just sounds so perfectly deep. It’s not like the sound is coming from across the room, but it’s not like the song is being played right next to you. It’s similar to car speakers, in the way it’s all round you, but not as if you’re listening to the persons car next to you. It’s intimate enough that you feel like it’s YOUR music, not someone else’s near you, but also distant enough that it’s like it’s your own personal concert. \n\nSEPARATION - Always tough because if a song is produced badly, even the greatest ever headphones won’t be able to separate the parts. But in a well produced track, you can actively hear each and every instrument and voice. In “Call it what you want” by Taylor Swift, there’s many instances where there are backing vocals playing over Taylor, and you can hear each one clearly, but as if they’re actually behind her. Like Taylor’s singing into your ear, whilst the backing singer is sat 2 foot behind her also singing, but you can clearly tell one is the main, one is the backing. The 560s definitely struggled with this, you often couldn’t hear the multiple voices, so now listening to many songs, I’m hearing voices I didn’t realise were there (I actually checked on 2 occasions that I wasn’t listening to a remix).\n\nConclusion:\nYes. Just yes. Stellar\n\nSetup I’m using:\nHifiman Arya Organic -> JDS Element 4 -> MacBook M3 -> Audirvana (because Tidal is buggy as anything on Mac since iOS 26 and Apple Music doesn’t auto change the Sample Rate) \n",

It is a\npretty loud and sometimes harsh electronic album that I've heard many times at this point through DT 990s but not through this setup.\n\nI noticed what I thought was peaking during some parts, but ultimately began to deduce it to the music just not being very well mixed and mastered for high-end listening application, but I'm still not 100% sure. The music is gritty, dirty, and honestly very fun to listen to. \n\nTruthfully the reason why I mention any of this is because I want to keep my things nice and prevent any wear, in other words, I want to protect my investment the best I can but I'm unsure if music like this (or any music) can really be considered \"unsafe\".\n\nI'll add, I am not listening at high volumes during this album, nor do I have anything EQ'd weirdly, it is essentially just a tube amp, a 6SN7 tube, and the headphones.\n\nIf anybody would want to hear what I'm talking\nabout, some songs I was questioning are all by Jane Remover:\n\nDreamflasher, movies for guys, Experimental Skin, search party.\n\nOnce again, I'm aware these songs are supposed to sound gritty, but there are also some more clear and crisp sections in each of these, so I'm trying to decide if I should embrace the grit and imperfections of these songs through the LCD 2c if it's safe, or continue on my Beyers.",

    "selftext": "\nI want highlight some QUALITY CONTROL issues (with both service and hardware!.)\n\nFirstly, the left side driver makes a mild but noticeable white noise/ electronic noise/ TINNITUS but only when the music is paused and not playing but goes away when music is played! This is erratic and random sometimes it doesn't! This tinnitus type noise goes away after a few seconds! And comes back when music is paused and it's a repeat cycle!(And no this isn't ANC noise coz it happens when even ANC IS OFF and only happens on the left ear driver/ hardware). And for this price i except a premium consistent experience, NOT this!\n\nAnd secondly, also only the left side earpad makes a mild squeaky toy noise when pressed, but right earpad is dead SILENT even when it's pressed. Is this is how it is suppose to be? Also ironically when earpads were interchanged, SURPRISE surprise! STILL only left side earpads makes this mild squeaky noise when pressed and whilst trying to wear it! (Despite the same earpad when on the right driver is dead SILENT and left earpads is silent on right?!)\n\nAnd thirdly!, the return policy is NON-EXISTENT! In my country!  And when asked about it throught their painfully call with executive they said RESET IT which I had already done MULTIPLE TIMES and tried MULTIPLE DEVICES from latest Android, IPAD AND MacBook Pro. Still it's persistent (random and occasional mild white noise/ mechanical noise from left ear driver alone)\n\nThey gave me an ultimatum to even get it checked I HAVE TO Ship my brand new expensive headphone AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND OWN RISK To their warehouse ACROSS THE COUNTRY! And after sonova took over all the service center were closed except one with courier-in type service center!\n\nMany told that the white noise/ TINNITUS issue SPECIFICALLY Left driver one is kinda common. Can you guys as confirm this for me and also other FUTURE BUYERS. Can you check and test in SILENT room with pausing after playing music.\n\nLastly, is this the QUALITY CONTROL by a 'TRUSTED' german brand? And hassle is almost unbearable and everytime I PAUSE I get left ear driver making a very mild tinnitus sound randomly! \n\nu/sennheiserconsumer\n",

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

    "title": "Avantone Pro Planar the II - Impressive underdog?",
    "selftext": "First of all I want to emphasize - I'm by no means a audio aficionado, just ur regular hifi enjoyer I would say.  \nStarted my journey in my teens with some cheap ass amp + bookshelf setup which at the time was still way better than anything you could get from the electronic store next door.   \nAnyway back to the topic - HEADPHONES. Been using a lot of \"High-End\" Consumer Devices on the go, Sennheiser, Sony, Bose, \\*cough\\* Apple \\*cough\\* - Jokes aside, and for the past years i've been rocking my AKG K712 Pro at home being driven by my Onboard DAC/Amp on my PC.   \nThe AKG were already a WOW moment for me compared to those big brand Consumer devices at the time and to this day I love those cans. Still going strong after 10 years.   \nSound - Clear, Punchy and no headache even after hours listening at extensive volume. And the Soundstage? Phenomenal. \n\nHaving said that, I hope you got the reference to what I will be comparing the Avantone to.\n\nQuick mention - I do drive my Headphones with the Fiio K11 R2R since a couple weeks, which already improved the sound of the AKG by a mile compared to the onboard solution.\n\n\\- Avantone Planar 2 Impression starts here -\n\nOut of the box first impressions were not too overwhelming, they are fairly unimpressive at first glance from a visual standpoint, the boxy \"cheese grater\" design looks actually kinda nice in the polished black colour I got here tho.  \nBuild quality is very solid, compared to all my previous headphones which were all just big chunks of plastic you get a solid metal frame, fairly thick leather strap which also has the width to spread the enormous weight of the headphones across your head so they actually do NOT feel heavy at all.  \nThe AKG already had comfortable Velour Pads but damn, those Pads on the Avantone are silky smooth and nice to touch.\n\nNow to the sound,\n\nOut-of-the-box: Not to impressive if you ask me. I felt like something was \"missing\" compared to the AKG. Everything felt kinda flat and very narrow in comparison.  \nBy no means did they sound bad, but just.. boring?  \nHaving said that, the low-end did have more punch and they also provided more details in busy passages. It was just uninspired and so narrow, as if you were stuck in a small box.  \nAt that point I was contemplating if the price tag of 429€ was worth it or if I should return them.   \n  \nBut then I gave em another shot after researching a bit and applied an EQ (Self Tweaked Version of the u/Oratory1990 EQ for the first iteration of the Avantone Planar) via APO (Peace Interface) and I was simply shocked.  \nIt really opened up the stage and completely removed the feeling of being boxed in. They take the EQ as if they were made for it.   \n  \nThe low end got even more punch without any signs of being too much for the driver. The midrange is just as detailed as before but the elevated treble is what enhances the whole experience to new heights. As I described earlier everything sounds alive, the stage is wider and most importantly - It's fun! (Which I feel like is a point a lot of people forget to talk about)  \n\n\nBy no means do I have the equipment to measure those things or the extensive knowledge to compare it to hundred other headphones in different price brackets.   \nI cant tell you, especially after applying the EQ, if they follow some imaginary \"perfect\" frequency response curve.  \nAll I can say is - I love those things after applying the EQ and will keep them for a long time to come! \n\nThat is all from me, if there is anything you would like me to add feel free to ask in the comments as this is my first \"review\" I probably missed a ton of important stuff.\n\nCheers y'all!",

    "selftext": "I ordered the AC45 from Aune's Official Store (mall.auneaudio.com) as I wasn't sure how long it would be before they're more widely available in the US and whether they would be carried by any of their distributors since they're a fairly niche product category. Shipping to the US was free which is nice but at no point was there any mention that they wouldn't handle import fees (tariffs) on their end before the product was shipped and I didn't think anything of it since I've had multiple orders from China where the seller handled everything ahead of time which is the proper way to do it. Today I got an email from UPS that I need to pay for the import fees on a shipment and I knew right away what it was for, ended up paying $27 of which $15 went to UPS for their BS charges to handle the import paperwork and processing. I'm a little annoyed at Aune since not only do they not mention this on their website or at checkout but they also picked the worst possible shipping option since DHL, FedEx, and UPS are known to be POS companies that charge extra fees on top of the actual import fee for essentially doing nothing. If they had shipped it via the postal service it wouldn't have been as big of an issue since they won't charge that extra fee and I would've only had to pay $12 in stead of $27. So if you're in the US and are thinking about ordering from Aune directly be prepared to pay extra on top of what the item costs, it's worth getting their products through other sellers if you can even if the price is slightly higher than their own store is selling them for to avoid these extra charges and the added hassle.\n\nP.S. I know that Aune isn't entirely to blame since this wouldn't be an issue at all if it wasn't for the current joke of an administration pretending to run this country but it's also the current reality that we're forced to live with and other companies have handled it much better than Aune has. If they had taken the time to figure out what the best option was instead of basically ignoring it and making their customers deal with the aftermath this wouldn't be an issue.",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven’t really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around £20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I’ve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn’t gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around £20 is crazy. \n\nI’ve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I’m no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who’s considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they’d be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can’t do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I’ve heard from a Sennheiser, it’s not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop… I know what you want me to say, but I don’t hate them. They’re definitely not the headphone I’m going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I’m hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro’s are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you’ve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I’d love to hear other’s perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I’ll get.",

    "selftext": "It’s been about a year since I bought the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones, and honestly… I’m done with Bose. The multipoint connection is just terrible.\n\nSometimes when I connect another device, the first one just disconnects for no reason. If I’m on a call and another device connects, it drops the call or randomly switches the audio back to my phone’s speakers — and then I can’t even get the sound back to Bluetooth unless I disconnect and reconnect the headphones.\n\nThe ear detection is also super inconsistent. Sometimes it pauses when I take them off, sometimes it keeps playing even when they’re around my neck. And other times, if I just tilt my head slightly, it pauses for no reason.\n\nBut the absolute worst part? Phone calls. Everyone I talk to keeps saying that they can hear all the background noise around me — sometimes even louder than my own voice. I honestly don’t understand how a company that’s supposed to be the world leader in noise cancellation can’t make headphones that handle calls properly.\n\nAnd to top it off, there’s this constant beep I get every 10 seconds when the connection to a device is lost. You can’t disable it, and it’s infuriating. It basically forces me to turn off multipoint altogether — which defeats the whole point of buying “premium” headphones that are supposed to handle multiple devices smoothly.\n\nI really wanted to love these, but between the connection issues, the unreliable ear detection, and the unusable mic for calls, I just can’t justify Bose anymore.",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice. But other than that I am so happy and juet feel peace with this setup. It sounds great, has lots of power and will hopefully last me a long time.",

    "selftext": "Hello everybody! so Long time ago (2016-17) my brother bought the AKG K44 and I remember it’s sounding incredible. He also had a Scarlet 2I2 sound card.\n\nIt’s been a year that we dont talk anymore and i wanted to buy the same by buying an AKG product. And so i went in with the AKG K72. However ALOT of problems have risen up Rn.\n\nThe audio sounds HORRIBLE! Its muffled, with me having to equalize the hell out of the headphone to sound the similar to my IEMs or the AKG K44. (I use the Onboard Motherboard sound card “gigabyte P110-D3” for more info) \neven then it screws my video/audio editing precision up,(volume control, General Equalization etc.) making me double check my videos twice with my IEMs. \n\nWhen I equalize it, i balance the bass but still give the cheap feeling  of when you listen to something with a bit of Bassy, the high and mids just go “low volume” mode. (Not sure that might be a sound card problem idk im new to the audio world)\n\nI was wondering if this is a fake headphone or not? And just general tips on what to do?\nThe headband just lost its stitches on its inner rubber and i had to stitch it myself (after 2 weeks of use btw).\nThe printing has some minor smudges on the font. As if they didnt paint it well, The cable feels nice tho and does not feel fake… but overall feels sketchy.\n\n(Im from iran and we dont have customer support here so i cant do anything but just look for tips here. Due to sanctions eveything is twice as expensive and banned here. Even buying stuff from amazon.)\n\nI’ve heared that if i buy a sound card (UE Volt 1) it will make it sound better, but im not sure… should it? Imean my brother’s K44 sounded amazing no matter what u plugged it into.\n\nSo what do i do?\n\nStart editing with my IEMs again?\nBuy the UE VOLT 1 sound card?\nGet a razor black shark V2X?\njust stop using the K72 entirely?\nI really dont know what to do tbh… ",

I do not mean that as a joke, these cans are audio garbage and I don't know why folks keep buying them. \nI'm making this review based on memory from a couple months ago since I basically got rid of them as soon as they came.\n\nBass: DISTORTED BLOATED DUMPSTER FIRE.\nOh boy the bass on these is absolutely horrid, I actually thought something was wrong with my pair until I looked at the distortion charts and yep it aligns with what I heard. \nSubbass: rolled off and flabby at the same time, no matter how I powered it. It was just very farty and anything close to normal volume made it sound extremely sad. I am not joking when I say this but an HD600 with a subbass shelf has cleaner bass. IT CANNOT DO SUBBASS EVEN STOCK.\n\nMids: actually not too bad, nothing to write home about. I honestly don't know what to say about it except for its mediocre and VERY IN YOUR FACE. Suicideboys was the only artist that sounded okay.\n\nHighs: OH BOY IT GETS WORSE, there is something real nasty goin on in the low-mid treble. This was something that could not be fixed with mods or whatever I did. Maybe it's a reflection or resonance from the driver cover? I tried everything in the book and I could not fix it.\nBut anyway, the treble wasn't fun. It was a hazy mess, any track sounded sharp and not detailed at the same time. I can accept being slightly piercing IF there is a good amount of detail output.\n\nThe baseline is that there are WAYYY better cans at the same price. I have also seen DMS recommending them and I can sort of understand why since his listening volume is extremely low (compared to mine) and doesn't run into the same distortion problems (I think).",

    "selftext": "I feel lied to! All over this sub, and other IEM subs have repeatedly said, \"If you can get it loud enough then you don't need an amp!\" LIES!\n\nI went to a headphone shop today, I brought my own dongle DAC/Amp. Tried a bunch of headphones. You know what? Yes I could get the demo units up to par listening volume. It was loud enough. Didn't even need to get to 80% volume for it to be loud. Huh, sounds decent.\n\nThen the guy said to try it with a dedicated desktop amp. I plugged it in, and lo' and behold, the audio is richer, soundstage is bigger, the headphones came ALIVE. Before, it was tinny and flat, but loud enough. Crazily, with the amp, the volume was actually set lower. Did I volume match? No, but I didn't need to because I could hear the difference before I got to the same volume. \n\nI always turn the volume down to zero before swapping anything. Before I even got halfway there to the same volume, I could already hear how much richer the sound was.\n\nFYI, it was a Samsung S22 Ultra -> Luxury & Precision W4 -> 4.4mm Out, this was the dongle DAC setup that actually sounds quite phenomenal for IEMs, but with headphones the W4 simply could not produce enough juice to *really drive* the headphones (HiFiMAN Edition XS). \n\nSo, do you need an amp if you are using headphones? The technical answer is no, but if you want to get the best out of it, then yes you do.",

    "title": "CVJ Neko: CVJ Neko: bass that hits and voices that whisper.",
    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n→ Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n→ Punchy bass.  \n→ Delicious female vocals.  \n→ Soundstage above average.  \n→ No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n→ DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n→ If you are a purist, stay away.  \n→ Mids somewhat soft.  \n→ Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30€/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a “more and better.”\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:** present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:** this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:** here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:** somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:** maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:** with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:** substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:** too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:** I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:** at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:** placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:** keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:** could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:** testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko’s character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos’ voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:** testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once… I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:** dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:** not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:** paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:** I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it’s unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that “I’m going to make you have fun” vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

    "title": "My experience with QCC Pro, BTD700 on iPhone 17 pro",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/hzhh291a74yf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1330b369663156fd2593bc89c456bd2a8ca3e1fb\n\nHi everyone:\n\nI used both the QCC Pro and BTD700 dongles to test various codecs (aptX, aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC) and noticed some distortion in the high frequencies—especially with piano tracks. This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don’t have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn’t test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can’t go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle — I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would’ve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn’t have a mobile app, but there’s one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn’t update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they’re very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side — the QCC Pro’s mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro’s design but prefer the BTD700’s price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they’re an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey’re extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I’m very sensitive — even picky — about anything pressing on my head (I can’t stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw’s traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft — genuinely reminiscent of Hermès leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Hermès bags, you’ll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn’t mean they’re not good for solo performances — I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it’s more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced — I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water… and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2flmc5e914yf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=70db2ea529ba5f5b1230ac28b4d91c7ec2cfedce\n\nSo, I want to talk about DACs. Personally, I’m not a believer in all that snake oil — people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don’t buy it. And honestly, I don’t think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I’ve always thought that if there’s any difference, it’s basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time — I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a “bigger soundstage,” I just assume it’s because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I’m open-minded — I’ll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that’s matched, everything else — bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging — sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I’m out. Either they’re trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don’t. In either case, their opinions don’t mean much to me anymore, because I can’t hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let’s talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn’t tell exactly what at first, but it didn’t feel like my imagination. After more testing — switching headphones, replaying the same tracks — I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head — especially those higher notes — in a way the K7 doesn’t. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that’s somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it’s like their voice locks into one spot — more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** — and I can’t believe I’m saying this — it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you — same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat’s not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer’s right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste — some benefit from that extra space, some don’t. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** — *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn’t huge, but it’s there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It’s actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it’s slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less “exciting.” The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah — I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It’s pricey, and there’s no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat’s my honest take.",

In some ways, they resemble the HE1000SE, though their soundstage feels much smaller compared to both the Sundara and the HEKSE. Interestingly, they pair wonderfully with the iBasso 260—to my ears, they sound even better through it than via the Mojo 2.\n\nOnce I save up, I’m considering getting the Hifiman Serenade amp/DAC to smooth out the HE1000SE’s sound, or perhaps investing in warmer headphones like ZMF. Unfortunately, ZMF headphones aren’t available here in Serbia.",

However, after testing them for a while, I noticed a few issues:\n\t•\tThe XM5 actually sounds fuller and more bodied than the XM6.

The sound quality is amazing — much richer, more powerful, and detailed than both the XM5 and XM6. It’s the kind of sound that makes you feel the music.

They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/32zx7vorb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=936216526ef630db67623a4916762c4a044cddee\n\n* The build quality and smoothness of the volume dial is excellent, feels and looks expensive in that Quad retro aesthetic kind of way.\n* The rear output mutes when headphones are connected on the front.\n* You can connect up dedicated 5V USB-C power input if using a non-USB source input which powers the R1 anyway along with data to a computer etc. You do not get more power running a dedicated power input as well as USB-C data.\n* The VU meter thing cannot be adjusted, it is fixed.\n* There are 4 preset EQs that cannot be customised, EQ 3 and 4 are the warmest sounding whilst 1 appears to be neutral.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3a1zapac2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b34214ad52527851a08aeda46634e265b1d77cf\n\nToggling input when playing via USB results in an overly longer than expected delay before USB input is resumed as it kills the USB connection when switching input to something else, meaning the computer doesn't see it any more and when going back to USB yo have to wait for it to initialise the USB input and be detected by the OS again.\n\nThere does not seem to be a USB DAC delay on initial audio playback which is great, but there is a very slight clipping noise that can be heard if there has been no audio playing and suddenly you play something like a Windows screenshot tone etc. This is something i have seen on other USB DACs before such as Toppings but not something I hear on more premium models like the X9, even without installing the Eversolo USB driver. This is usually resolved by installing the USB DAC driver provided by the maker, but [SMSL does not have such a driver for the R1](https://www.smsl-audio.com/portal/product/downlist/id/11.html).\n\nThe sound when the treble/bass sliders are set to flat and EQ is set to 1 (neutral) is decent, soundstage is wide and imaging is pleasing. I would say it sounds as good as any good dongle DAC out there. The volume dial stepping is digital, and its 0% volume rest position is around 8 o'clock but audio cannot be heard until the dial moves to just above 8 o'clock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unh2e5uyb2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=543c5fadfb1cc44339cf3758d73cf601b3a33d75\n\nWhen all processing is flat/off there is no noticeable distortion even at high volume on both HE1000se and HD600. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih4wc1k5c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=729948d649f5ce4ddf421d1be1c21acebfcce333\n\nThe power output is 130mW so quite low, but it's capable of driving both headphones just fine and loud.\n\nWhen you enable any EQ or adjust the tone controls, distortion comes in at higher volumes especially noticed in songs with bass or audio with bass, so for gamers playing shooters, this is a big issue if you want to tone control or use one of the better EQ presets as flat is just that and lacks any smoothness/warmth in sound signature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j87meo97c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76683158a5dc1f033677e071151592f4e455520c\n\nUsing it is a DAC only and pre-amp using the RCA outputs to the power amp it does an OK job although there is noticeable noise floor interference that can be heard, just like what I found with the Creek 4040A a while back. Seems the analogue circuitry is not isolated.\n\nI then plugged in the RCA interconnect between the X9 and power amp to test and heard no noticeable interference noise. In this config the power amp was set to bypass and R1 used as pre-amp, in pure DAC mode and volume controlling via the power amp, the same noise can be heard once you increase the power amp's volume, the R1's volume is maxed out in this test to imitate bypass and be DAC only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r54td2q8c2yf1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3de0a8271051809a0c92c11c9a8c9092c9be0307\n\nIt is priced at $71 currently, I think if you must have a desktop sitting box to use and interact with then ok it's fine, but these caveats have to be considered. Otherwise I would say the ONIX Alpha XI1 offers better sound with none of the distortion issues or noise etc at a slightly higher price and offers more power, lower THD+N.\n\nThe other advantage of the R1 though is it has dedicated mic input, although if you are a gamer you almost certainly have a USB mic or headset anyway so this is not really a selling factor.\n\nThe volume dial is super slick though, there is that....\n\nI was unable to open up the housing properly for a teardown as even with all the screws out, I could not lift out the top panel with the sliders properly without fearing breaking something. Either it is glued on, or there is a method to it.",

I got sick of the provided headset so I bought this set for work, being wireless, good battery life, good mic features (that noise fence tech is the real MVP). Usually I'll wear these over a set of flathead IEMs when I'm on the phone. These can do dual connection with BT and the usb dongle, just never really thought to use them for my phone. I forgot my IEMs going into the office the other day, so I set up the BT for music and HOT DAMN.\n  \nWith ANC on these are absolute bass cannons. The subbass extension from a set of on-ears is insane. Every kick hit has the most pleasing thump associated. There's a pleasant rumbling following the bass track, you can actually feel the music coming through your ears. The treble is subdued, rather tastefully imo, it definitely takes a back seat to the bass. Luckily if you want to adjust the bass just flip the ANC off and you get more mids and highs. \n  \nBut again. HOT DAMN. I am wicked impressed with these. If you're a fellow bass head and need something for a job with remote communication, 10/10 I suggest these.",

    "selftext": "Today I received the brand-new FiiO K13 R2R DAC/AMP, which I picked up mainly out of curiosity to explore the sound signature of R2R technology. My current setup includes the Topping DX5 II, which absolutely shines with electronic genres (rave, techno, acid, house, IDM, EDM) you name it.. It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That’s exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I’ll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you’ve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

But this is my office, and although I do have a nice stereo system here, headphones are sometimes more adequate. I've recently got a pair of Sennheiser HD600s, powered by a Fiio K11 R2R, and they work fine.\n\n  \nPerhaps my questions are more on the subject of headphones than of this one in particular, maybe. I use Sonus Faber Sonettos here, and I absolutely love them. The headphones just seem \"constrained\" maybe. I am not good at describing such things. But they seem to be lacking \"openness\" and some space. Don't know if it's the HD600s, the amp, or just the nature of headphones themselves, being placed in your head for example, I know their weight may be a factor, I don't know, just not feeling it.\n\n  \nHope any of you can relate and give me some advice, thank you all!",

    "selftext": "I listened to both back-to-back, and both sounded amazing, but I definitely felt like the Ananda Nano was clearer and on every track, and you could definitely notice a difference. \n\nHowever, people kept saying the Edition XS bass is better than the Nano, but I felt the Nano's bass hit harder, and sometimes felt like it was overdone. \n\nFor example, I played Drakes “From Time”, and the bass sounded boomy, different to how my AirPods Pro 2, Edifier R2000DB and how the Edition XS presenter the bass - they all sounded correct. Nano’s bass sounded overdone Sort of similar to how the AirPods Pro 3 sounded, like it was too V-shaped. I prefer a neutral headphone with a slight V-emphasis. I don’t understand why the Nano would present the bass in this way given everyone has said it’s a neutral headphone. Can this bass be EQ’d?\n\nThe XS sounded perfect, but the Ananda Nano sounded a bit boomy. But on every other track, the bass sounded tight and great, and there was just more separation and overall clarity on the Ananda Nano. But people kept saying it's like an analytical, dry headphone. I'm open to EQing it, like I have an EQ software on my PC, but what would you recommend between the two of them?",

In this review, I’ll be speaking about the Kiwi Ears Ardor, a pair of Wireless Over Ear headphones with ANC capabilities and sold for a competitive listing price.\n\n>*Disclaimer: the Kiwi Ears Aventus were sent to me by Kiwi Ears so that I could write an honest review. This review represents my personal opinion on the set, it isn't promotional or paid content and I don’t get any revenue from the sales of this product.*  \n*At the time of the review, the Kiwi Ears Aventus were on sale for about $72.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4giq7q011yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee4768ab389034deee24688b0c66af6a709d16cd\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Type of headphone → Over-Ear\n* Driver Configuration → Dual DD 40mm + 10mm coaxial\n* Bluetooth version → 5.4, supporting SBC and AAC codecs (no AptX, no LDAC) +  low-latency mode\n* Bluetooth range → 8-10m (free open environment)\n* ANC → Hybrid ANC, noise reduction depth -32B±3dB\n* Battery capacity and declared battery life → 1000mAh, for a total of about 18hrs with ANC+RGB ON, 45hrs with ANC ON and 82hrs with ANC OFF\n* Fast charging → Yes, 10 mins of charge correspond to 4 hours of playback (with ANC OFF)\n* Frequency response → 20Hz-40KHz\n* Impedance → 16Ω ± 10% @ 1KHz\n* Sensitivity → 102dB ± 3dB @ 1KHz 1mW\n* Weight → 290g (measured on my own non-professional scale)\n* Charging port → Type-C\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus come well packed and the box contains:\n\n* The Kiwi Ears Aventus\n* A Detachable Audio cable\n* A USB Type-C charging cable\n* A USB Type-C charging data cable\n* One pair of tuning foam pads\n* A User Manual\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pai8tu1211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32969399057b4033a0436c5ea40f887de653a619\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wvslc2211yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9efb4d8248c5ec6bca280f13fac1bff2531f3a08\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ronqcdr311yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c12208d2b329ec81ee43216ecbae80d793fd5442\n\n# Design, Build Quality, Comfort and Isolation\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus look very “DJ”-ish, with a pretty thick junction between the earcups and the sliders and a large headband. The earcups themselves have RGB lighting that you can activate or keep OFF, and when the RGB lights are OFF the headphones just look like any other headphone. When turned ON, they give some sort of gaming vibes which is confusing since these are supposed to be sold to DJs so it doesn’t seem like the target is well-defined, at least if we speak about lighting only. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knkv19g411yf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a782c04a5cdf3988d4358633ff85fbc2be306cb3\n\nThe overall build quality is solid, the sliders look and feel sturdy, the earcups themselves have about 90°C swivel on the back and and a couple degrees of swivel on the front as well to grant some headroom for proper fit and the overall softness of the pads and headband cushion is decent. The headphones are also foldable and this makes up for an easy-to-carry set, even though they sit quite awkwardly in the storage case.  The comfort itself is pretty good from my own experience, just be aware that the pleather pads could become pretty warm during summer or hot periods in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omubezl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a9cf8e2c43f1a1950eb07df223cd4aed1cf480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ozhzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcc854db3fd68d9f35ff467f2d33782027dd5bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8rgrzl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826ba7f50c9920c089b54a0447621625ffde6a38\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ckyyl611yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=609c2127c547e2efb3f8dfc959c2c34f4c1fa761\n\nThe buttons on the earcups are responsive and they don’t cheap when clicked since there’s enough tension to them, even though the sound coming from them could have been a bit more muted in order to feel more “premium” (but that’s just a nitpick, nothing else).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/poj54dc711yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89863a313cd6087121e7fb116333aab9eb5c1eb9\n\n# Battery Life and Connectivity\n\nThe battery life is pretty good yet not the best you can find in this price range (especially considering that the Ardor exist) good, and although I didn’t have the chance to test the full 45  hours with ANC ON and RGB lighting OFF, I have done some testing and noted the remaining battery life after some listening.\n\nAfter 30 hours of listening with no charge between multiple sessions, the battery life displayed on my phone’s bluetooth settings for the Aventus was 29%, meaning that 71% of the battery was consumed in the first 30 hours of listening. Hypothesizing the same usage, which involved slightly different volume levels, ANC ON and RGB OFF and random calls here and there, we can assume that about 10 more hours of listening will consume the remaining battery life (more or less).\n\nSure, these aren’t objective measurements in optimal conditions (mixed usage, various volume levels, a couple calls here and there) but these are respectable numbers from my point of view.\n\nSomething that I cannot understand is the reason why a DJ would use these with bluetooth, since although these are shipped with a couple wires to use them wired, they are still promoted as DJ headphones, hence it’s pretty confusing that you have RGB lighting and bluetooth (I can understand ANC, instead, since it could help isolating from external noises during live sets).\n\nSo, you can use these wired connecting them to your amp or DJ console/controller, or you can use them in bluetooth mode: in this regard,I haven’t experienced any issues, disconnections or other types of problems related to pairing and/or connecting to the headphones, both in single point and multi-point mode. Just make sure you pair every single device singularly before using them in multi-point mode and you’ll be fine.\n\n# ANC/Transparency feature, Latency and Commands\n\nThe ANC of the Kiwi Ears Aventus is okay, and even though you’re not getting Bose-like ANC you’re still getting some isolation that will avoid super high volumes just to get rid of the surrounding noises. The passive isolation is pretty good as well so those in combination do the job, especially considering Just like with the Ardor, I have noticed a weird behaviour of the ANC when I’m on the bus and the bus itself meets some street bumps along the way: in those cases, the ANC makes some annoying pops that I have already heard when using my KZ Carol TWS. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s something worth mentioning.\n\nThe transparency feature works well, it doesn’t emphasize things too much making them almost “artificial” and I think it’s definitely usable. I have used sets with a better transparency mode, but I think this is on-point and accomplishes the task pretty well.\n\nThe latency is there, I am not gonna lie, and even using the low-latency mode it still isn’t low enough to make hassle-free gaming possible: if you’re playing games and want a wireless set, I don’t think this is the right one, it’s just better to buy a headset with proprietary 2.4GHz dongle since universal bluetooth connectivity has its own limits (and these don’t even have AptX to compensate for them).\n\nThe commands are responsive and easy to understand, and haven’t encountered any issue in this regard.\n\n# Sound\n\n**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**\n\n* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n* Laptop and Desktop PC with Bluetooth 5.1 USB adapter\n* Lenovo Chromebook Duet\n\n**Let’s talk about the sound**\n\nI will be talking about the Aventus with ANC ON and Music Mode ON.\n\nThe Aventus are mostly balanced with some added bass, a relaxed upper midrange and slightly boosted treble response (not fatiguing though). Depending on your head-size and on how they fit and clamp on your head, you’re going to have slight deviations from what I am saying and that is probably one of the weaknesses of this product. The main issue, in fact, is that very small positioning differences on my head lead to sound differences that I struggle to explain, so it was a very inconsistent experience in my case and a very hard product to review. \n\nTo me, the Aventus are okay, with an overall balanced response that never gets overdone in a specific part of the response. The bass, for example, is not overcooked or muffled, nor is it too thick/overpowering, and it’s there in the right quantity with average speed. It’s not very textured yet not super fat to the point that you don’t hear any texture in it, if that makes sense.  \nThe lower midrange has some added warmth even though the midbass isn’t rich enough to empower the lower mids, so the lower mids are probably boosted by the tuner to warm things up a bit without the need of pushing the bass more than that. The upper mids, instead, aren’t fatiguing and they never become hot, and I’d say that they’re not as emphasized as on your average Harman-tuned headphone.  \nThe treble isn’t fatiguing but there’s some spice here and there to avoid darkness, even though the highs definitely feel like something is missing up top (some details and sparkle, for example). The mid-treble can get a bit peaky at times also and this makes some cymbals slightly unnatural or splashy and some “S” sounds a bit sharp occasionally.  \nUsing the spare foams included in the box can attenuate the treble even more, although I don’t really find these annoying.  \n  \nThe soundstage isn’t very spacious, but it’s okay for a closed back set, and the imaging is also okay overall. Nothing to write home about I’d say but no true bad words to spend here either. \n\nTurning OFF the ANC gives the sound a warmer tint, the mid-treble emphasis is tamed a bit and the headphones become a touch more controlled and relaxed, even though they are still mildly V-shaped. The soundstage and imaging remain intact.\n\nClicking the ANC button twice activates the gaming mode, which kinda makes the bass tighter and gives a more V-shaped tinge to the sound with slightly tighter and less thick bass and more treble emphasis. I’d say it helps a bit with spatial cues in game even though a pair of KSC75 or similar stuff will still give you cleaner positional cues, period.\n\n**Microphone quality**\n\nThe microphone quality is passable, nothing that screams high quality but I’d say it’s usable for calls and similar stuff. The noise cancellation is overall pretty strong, which is good news, although sometimes it cuts out some parts of my voice trying to eliminate the surrounding noises.  \nHere you have an example of the microphone quality:\n\n# Some comparisons: \n\n**Kiwi Ears Ardor vs Kiwi Ears Aventus**\n\n>With ANC ON, both are tendentially bassy and warm-sounding with average technical performance. However, the Aventus goes for a warmer presentation up top, with less upper midrange and less low-end as well. The main issue, in my opinion, is that the response relies too much on the positioning of the headphones on the head, leading to an inconsistent listening experience that I found dealbreaking. The technical performance of the Aventus is also inferior compared to the Ardor and varies with positioning on the head. The Ardor sound less loud even at higher volumes compared to the Aventus. In terms of overall value, the Ardor are a lot more specific, they look and feel like a more well-thought product and target the average casual user who wants a portable, comfortable and bassy headphone for the day-to-day commuting, whereas the Aventus are still confusing to me: they have RGB to appeal gamers, the DJ design to appeal DJs, but they somehow have a sort of “inconsistent” sound experience which is not ideal for DJs since they never stay in the same position when they’re performing (source: I used to DJ as well so I know what I am talking about). In addition, the Ardor has better battery life so it’s the smarter choice between the two if you don’t wanna charge it as frequently as you’d do with the Aventus (not that their battery life is bad but the Ardor have better battery life and that’s objective).  \nIn my opinion, the Ardor gives you something more for your money and it’s a sleeker and more comfortable set for everyday use. The Aventus are not “bad” per se, but some quirks make them less recommendable than the similarly priced Ardor, which are a lot more consistent no matter how you wear them and truly feel like something that was designed a touch better.\n\n**Kiwi Ears Aventus vs Sony WH-1000XM5**\n\n>Very different price yet maybe someone could be curious to compare a couple different options. To me, both sound a touch unnatural, but there are a couple key differences.   \nThe XM5 sound more V-shaped with brighter treble and a lot more low-end (even too much at times). However, they almost sound the same everytime I wear them whereas the Aventus are kinda inconsistent so the perceived level of bass and treble kinda depends on the fit. In terms of overall technical performance, I think there aren’t big differences even though the XM5 sound sometimes more resolving due to the brighter treble (it’s more of a “perceived” clarity” up top but it doesn’t really translate into a better opinion from my side).  \nThe comfort is good on both sets but the WH-1000XM5 sit on my head way better and are more stable. In terms of passive isolation and ANC, the WH-1000XM5 easily takes the lead.  \nIn terms of overall customization through the app, bluetooth codecs and so on, the WH-1000XM5 easily win. However, I’d say the battery life of the Aventus is one of their strengths (even though you have to count the worse ANC and so on).  \nThe price is very different and although the sound signatures are different, the sum-up of this comparison is that spending more will give you a more refined and well-though product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus aren't revolutionary nor do they set new standards. It's a set that has some fit issues that lead to an inconsistent sound, so everyone's experience may vary depending on the size of the head, on how the headphones are placed on the head, and it's probably the biggest fault of this product.  \nThe Kiwi Ears Aventus score a 3/5 from me, which may seem like a bad vote but that is a 6/10 that hopefully will convert into a better rank if they'll ever release a sequel with better overall consistency. The sound is pretty pleasant, the comfort is nice, the headphones are foldable and they should appeal to many users, but the target market itself is also confusing so it's another thing that makes them less \"specific\".  \nSome say \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\", and this is probably the way I'd like to end my review: I think Kiwi Ears is able to appeal most of the people out there but they should not do that with a single product. It's much better to carefully design a product targeted to very specific users rather than trying to make one that has to appeal many people without excelling in anything particular for those specific users.  \n  \nThanks Kiwi Ears for starting the journey in over-ear headphones, this is a welcomed choice and hopefully we'll see even more competition in the full-size cans' market space.  \n",

    "title": "Trying 2 New Sets -  Fiio FT1 Pro and Senn HD490 Pro - First Impressions and Comparisons - warning: not well organized!",
    "selftext": "I just wanted to check these out because of some of the hype and descriptions, mostly on YouTube, recently. By hype, I mean kind of mixed reviews, but some really good ones. So I have only had them a couple of days, and I have been listening to a bunch of music, a fair mix of classic rock 60's - present, Indie, jazz, electronic, random sort of late 2000's stuff (ie. a band called Flipturn, Big Thief) and just tons of stuff, I have broad tastes. Also played a few hours of Diablo 4 on each, and have played many hours of this and other games on my other sets. As I right this I am listening to the 490's with the producer pads, Pink Floyd Breathe is playing. Sounds great.\n\nSo, TLDR, I kinda agree with a lot of the reviews. These sets sound great, but may not be what some might expect, especially the 490's. Both sets are enjoyable, and have good bass - the 490's of course have two profiles depending on the pads - the leatherettes (producer pads) are bassier and a bit of a V, while the fabric (mixing pads) are more neutral, with both less bass and slightly tamer treble. \n\nI am no expert, and I don't want to get too descriptive, but I thought I'd give some simple first impressions, in case they might be helpful. It also sort of helps me focus on what is important to my listening approach, what it is I like about different sets.\n\nSo both these sets have solid bass. The bass quality on the Fiio is great. It is a little less in volume compared to the 490 producer pads, quite a bit more than the mixing pads. But the slam and impact is better than both of those. They both have great extension into the sub. The mids are great on both, a little smoother on the Fiio. Neither are nearly as good timber as my HD600's, or Focal Clears (which are also not quite as good in mid timbre as the 600's, but pretty close). The soundstage is not too bad on the 490's, and is very good on the FT1 Pro's, but neither are as good as the Hifiman Edition XS in that area, and nowhere near the Arya Stealth. The FT1 Pro interestingly sounds somewhat similar to it's closed back sibling, the FT1 closed back dynamic, but you can clearly hear the planar vs. dynamic qualities, and the overall tuning, soundstage and perceived separation (probably not the actual separation) is better on the Pro. The bass is cleaner on the Pro, but is warmer and more organic, and enveloping on the FT1 - I don't prefer either, the bass is great on both. It is more \"hifi/audiophile\" sounding on the Pro. The bass on the Pro is a bit more prominent then on the 2 Hifiman's I mentioned, and little more than on the Clears too. But not better - I think quality of bass on those is at least as good, arguably, for me, a little more enjoyable. Also, those three - the Stealth, XS and Clear, all sound overall better to me - when you take resolution, soundstage, timber, balance, the sort of holistic experience. Very subjective and non-audiophile of a description, sorry, just trying to get my gut impressions out - I expect you to add a grain of salt.\n\nThese are both great for gaming (I am not doing FPS these days, mostly AARPG's and single player).\n\nSo these are just some, somewhat chaotic and compressed, impressions and thoughts on these so far. Still listening to the 490's, and psychological burn in is applying, increasing my enjoyment further. Pat Metheny just ended, and Steely Dan Rikki Don't Lose that Number is playing. Sounds great, but the bass is not as good as the Pro, and the overall quality (whatever that is) is still not as good - for me - as the Hifimans or Clears that I mentioned. It's just a touch shoutier, I mean not to an unpleasant degree, but you can hear it, and same with the FT1 Pro. But with the \"burn in\" (just adaptation) I stop noticing it, and it is no impediment to my enjoying the music.\n\nDon't know if I will keep either of these - I will test them out for a few more days.\n\n  \nMen I Trust \"Tailwhip\" playing now. Listened to some of this and Biig Piig on both sets. Prefer them on the Fiio, because of the better bass and soundstage. These sound good though, well balanced, everything is clear, all the details are easy to hear, separation is great, the vocals are fairly forward, but the timbre, again, not quite as good as some of my other sets.\n\nSo would I recommend these? I don't know why anyone would care what I recommend, but I will say that the Fiio is a no brainer for the price, if you don't have a planar that you like already. If you already have a planar that you like, you don't need it. This vs the XS, I prefer the XS - it sounds more polished, the treble is less gritty to me, and the separation and staging is better. Some reviewers say the opposite, that the treble is toned down on the FT1 Pro compared to the Edition XS, but I am not experiencing that at all. Maybe my ears are weird. Neither of these come close to the Stealth for me, overall, although they both have qualities some might prefer - just not for me. The 490's will be great for mixing and mastering, if you do that (I do, and might keep them just for that), great for gaming, and pretty great for music listening, but they are not an HD600 with better bass. They are different, the mids are way different in timbre, and more forward, as is the low treble. That gives a very slight feeling of shoutiness - that might be too strong of a term - just a slight grit to the upper mids and low treble, that is not present at all on the 600's.\n\nFleetwood Mac Gold Dust Woman playing now. Sounds great. But when switch to the FT1 Pro, it is a little brighter, the soundstage is better, the bass is more clean and impactful. I think I prefer it for music listening. But I admit, I like treble detail, and that sort of clinical, \"hifi\" character for music listening, for all genres, maybe except for really aggressive metal - but I don't listen to too much of that. \n\nTbh, any one of the sets discussed I could be ok with as my only set (except I need a closed back for tracking, which I use the FT1 non pro for currently, wouldn't mix with them though, not solely). But I would rank my current stable as follows: Stealth>Clears and Maxwell tie>XS>FT1 Pro>FT1 and 490 tie. Not sure where I put the HD600 - I love the mids and timbre, and just natural feel, but I hate the bass roll off. Probably somewhere in the middle.\n\nI hope that confused wall of text was not to painful to read. It's just a gestalt set of impressions, another data point for anyone looking at these sets.\n\n",

    "selftext": "This topic has been discussed by others here and elsewhere before, but I genuinely couldn't find a conclusive answer, so I'm asking here: how much power do T50s actually need?\n\n\n\nPeople seem to often conflate \"loud enough\" with \"getting powered properly\". Loudness is dependant on gain, i.e. Voltage, but that's literally only half the equation for power. As far as I understand it, the issue is that you obviously need current as well to move the driver, but also that impedance is dependant on frequency (due to inductance and capacitance of the headphone). So certain headphones might be loud enough at lower power, but actually have a changed frequency response.\n\n  \nTheory aside, I actually noticed this myself with my Dekoni Blue (factory modded T50RP MK3s). They had a noticeably better bass response on my topping NX1s (150 mW into 32Ω) compared to my SMSL M3 (108mW into 32Ω), even though these are both overspeced, when going by Headphone.com's power calculator (suggesting 3.98mW for 110dB). Obviously everyone agrees that that number is completely off, judging, by the T50s reputation for being hard to drive, but nobody ever explains why exactly that's the case, or how much power they actually require. Logically there would have to be a point where the frequency response stops changing, and I'd like to know where that point is.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a better explanation for the physics of power requirements please also share. I think this topic is surrounded by so many half-truths, it's impossible to find good information. ",

They're what I have been looking for and they deliver.*\n\nStuff I use as references / comparisons / competition:\n\n* Sennheiser ie900 + Qudelix 5K PEQ \n* Focal Clear OG + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Elegia\n* sennheiser HD650 + Topping A90+D90\n* Focal Bathys + Android/Linux\n* Sony WH-1000XM5 + Android/Linux\n\nMusic I usually listen to:\n\n*   Mostly metal/rock/prog (Bleed from Within, Knocked Loose, Mars Volta, Mastodon, QOTSA, Deftones...)\n*   Classic rock (think Fleetwood Mac, Beetles,  and friends)\n*   Pop/Alt (Taylor Swift, Wolf Alice, Last Dinner Party, Manchester Orchestra, Portugal. The Man, ...)\n*   Hip hop, mostly 90s but also some newer stuff\n*    Jazz, but only on a Friday\n\n**Sound**\n\nThe important bit. All thoughts are based on the neutral, default EQ settings.\n\nI have different headphones for different things. I have my Focal Clears and ie900 for detail. I have my HD650 for cosy and relaxed listening.\n\nI have my Focal Bathys for times when I need to block the world out and enjoy music without disruption.\n\nI have my WH-1000XM5 for ... everything else. Seriously, I wear these 8 hours a day while working, doing the dishes, hoovering, gardening.\n\nThey're just great at being portable and disappearing on my head. They get out of the way and the sound is very unremarkable and never distracting.\n\nOh and the Elegia. They're terrible. We don't talk about those.\n\nNow imagine if somehow all those headphones were put in a blender and out poured the perfect mix of them all. All the compromises in the right places. The bad bits barely noticeable. The good bits there in enough measure to make the whole mix perfect.\n\nThat's the HDB630.\n\n* Just enough detail that I can listen to the detail without being waterboarded and fatigued by it.\n* Just enough warm buttery smooth mid-range without being muddy or overly warm.\n* Just enough treble sparkle without feeling ringy, metallic, or sharp.\n* Just enough bass without feeling swollen, thick, or intrusive.\n* Just enough width and imaging without feeling sparse or overwhelming.\n* Just enough physical lightness and clamping to be comfortable.\n* Just enough flattery of the recording without being cute.\n* Just enough ANC without ... well, the ANC could be better but nobody is beating Sony.\n* Just enough for serious listening without hogging your attention\n\nPoint is, it's enough of everything. In the right mix. It is just ... right. My Bathys will be going on ebay or something, and I can't see my XM5 getting much use anymore.\n\nThey're not \"impressive for a closed back\" or \"impressive for a wireless headphone\" or anything like that. They're \"impressive. Full stop. In all categories.\".\n\n**BT700 dongle + App**\n\nThis all seems OK. Not really played with it too much and don't feel the need. The dongle works fine and works on Linux so that's good.\n\nBT on Android was the usual. Seems stable.\n\n**Build quality**\n\nIt's enough. If not having metal hinges means they hit the price point, then good on them. I'd rather this level of sound\n\nwas accessible to as many people as possible. The chassis is good. Comfort is good. Not the best, but perfectly enough.",

The issue I’m facing now is that while the volume in Windows (YouTube/Spotify) sounds fine, the in-game audio becomes very quiet when using this EQ profile, even at max volume.\n\nOratory suggests increasing amplifier gain, but I don’t currently have an amp, just my motherboard driving the 560S. After checking some Reddit threads, I made a shortlist of potential DAC/amp options, but I’m unsure which one would best solve the issue and remain future-proof (in case I switch to something like IEMs or Beyerdynamics later).\n\nHere are the options I’m considering (considering I am EU based):\n\n* FiiO K11\n* FiiO K5 Pro\n* Topping DX3 Pro+\n* FX-Audio DAC-X6 Mini HiFi 2.0\n* Fosi Audio Q4\n* Any other alternative that I might have missed and is better than the above ones\n\nP.S. don't go too hard on me, I am all new to EQ and DACs/AMPs.",

    "title": "Arya Organic…Wow",
    "selftext": "My thoughts on the Arya Organics (I know there’s plenty of reviews etc, but what harm can another do)\n\nI jumped into this hobby about 2 years ago roughly. Through that time, I’ve been through plenty headphones, but the only ones I spent a LOT of time with was 2. The Arya Stealth, and the HD560s. \n\n(Skip further down if you don’t care about the previous stories)\n\nThe Stealths were mind blowing to me, I did have planars before these. The edition xs (felt way too cheap for the 300 mark at the time. The Ananda Nanos (clamped like a vice). So picked up the Arya Stealths for £710, which was their cheapest price at the time. I owned these for 6 months. Every time I put them on, I was astounded at the sound. However, after 2 months, I rarely used them, I didn’t have the time to listen, and didn’t want £700 lying around. So I reluctantly sold them, and decided to pick up the cheaper pair, the HD560s. So I could still enjoy music, without feeling guilty having some premium set collecting dust. And these were fine, for £90, they were great.\n\nRecently however I’m now in a position where I have a lot more free time, and for that reason, I wanted to pick up a higher end headphone again. I was debating between many, but in the end it kept boiling down to the Stealths, which were now £460. But then saw the Organics were just £120 extra as “open-box” from Hifiman. One thing I absolutely hated with the Stealths was how harsh some of the treble was, and at the time I didn’t have EQ. So I was stuck with harsh treble in a few songs I enjoyed other times. Between owning the 560s and Stealths, I did pick up the JDS Element 4 Dac/Amp in preparation for higher end cans in the future, and to play around with EQ. So hearing the Organics had a harsh treble, it didn’t really deter me as I had the capabilities to town it down.\n\nSo now onto the Organics…\n\nLOOKS:\nThese things are absolutely gorgeous! It’s like taking your grandads beautifully varnished wooden table and chairs, and adding a modern touch to it. It makes them stand out and look far more premium than the price suggests (I’m aware they were 1500 odd on release, but on current pricing, the point stands). They feel more premium for this matter. I the one massive negative, is you have to wear them to listen, meaning I can’t just stare at them when in use. \n\nCOMFORT:\nAnyone who’s familiar with the Arya lineup, know that this line of headphones are on the comfier side of the Hifiman brand. They clamp just enough to not feel loose, but not too hard that it feels like the hulk is crushing your skull (Nanos). Yes the pads aren’t the most comfy pads on any headphone, they’re actually the one aspect I don’t like. They don’t feel premium, and the fabric design sometimes catches the odd strand of hair which isn’t pleasant. However changing these means altering the sound, which you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, want to do. The headband is perfect though. Suspended straps are my favourite on headphones, adds a premium feel, look and feels like far less pressure on your head. Not to mention how wide they are, it helps distribute the weight so well.\n\nUNBOXING: \nDead, £5 unboxing experience, but realistically who cares…\n\nSOUND:\nGrand. Exciting. Smooth. \n\nThe 3 words I’d use to describe the sound. Which goes to show how versatile they are. They give off such a ‘grand’ feeling, when you listen to orchestral pieces, it feels like you’re in a theatre listening to a band playing, but like you’re middle row. Not first row where it feels in your face, and not back row that it feels like it’s far away. It’s that perfect middle ground where it’s around you, but so that you can hear everything so cleanly. They’re exciting in the sense that after an orchestral piece, you put on an EDM track, pop or anything in that region, and it feels like you want to get up and just dance, but don’t, as these probably would fall off your head. And then you go for a very vocal focused piece of music, and the smoothness of the voice just glides through your ears. There’s no moment where it’s aggressive (unless it needs to be) or where it holds back. It’s like an electric supercar. You put your foot down, and it picks up straight away, but with no aggression, just picks up and gets going right away. \n\nOnto the specifics:\n\nBASS - Very solid. Definitely stronger than the Arya Stealths. When I had them, the bass was there, but it needed a tad more punch. These add that very subtle punch, where you know it’s bass, but it doesn’t slip into the other frequencies and overthrow them. It’s controlled VERY well. The sub bass is fantastic too. My favourite song to test this is “The Droid Invasion and the Appearance of Darth Maul” from The Phantom Menace. The drums at the start provide that sub bass test and it really shows how it handles it well. Doesn’t get fatiguing, just presents it so smoothly. Not to mention how clear the drums sound, like you can visualise the fabric drum stick hitting against the massive drum. The bass is also quick when needing to be. In many pop songs where there is the common use of bass, or in rap music, it’ll show the bass, and stop it perfectly. It never feels like it over presents itself. They also hold the bass off so well from overpowering the mids. Many headphones either make the bass so minimal that you don’t realise there should be bass, and many push it so hard it dims down the vocals. These control it so so well.\n\nMIDS - I would say the weakest out of the Low, Mid and High ends. Definitely NOT bad, it’s really really great. However when there is consistent bass present, and a lot of higher end or many many instruments playing, the vocals definitely take a seat back. They’re still very clear, but it pushes the instruments forward a bit more. Which isn’t bad at all, and some people may prefer this. It’s more of a preference thing. I certainly don’t mind it, and it’s not something I’m gonna be quickly to go and EQ, but if I was, it’s the first thing I’d play with, just to bring them forward a touch. BUT, when there’s only a low end and vocals, or high end and vocals, they are stunning. They just sound so real and ‘organic’, it’s like having a conversation with David Attenborough, just so nicely spoken and a voice you wish could commentate on your whole life. \n\nHIGHS - Lies were told here, or obviously it’s just down to personal hearing. But these are NOT ‘peaky’ or ‘harsh’. The high end is so well controlled. With the Arya Stealth, I absolutely could not listen to Nightcall - Kavinsky from Drive. The chorus of the song was so harsh I literally couldn’t listen to it. So the first song I wanted to try was that, and on these I could listen to the entire song with no issues. They have just enough brightness to make everything sound clean and clear, but not too much that it comes across as piercing during songs. Same with Time - Pink Floyd. The start with all the clocks can be very piercing with poorly controlled highs, but it’s like the headphones actively know it’s going to sound harsh and presents them just a tone down so that you don’t have to turn the volume down or skip forward. It was my one worry with these, and although EQ is an option, I did want to enjoy them stock for as long as possible. Which I’m ecstatic with the fact I can.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE - Wide, but not artificially wide, just naturally wide. Like I said with the orchestral hall and being “grand”. It just sounds so perfectly deep. It’s not like the sound is coming from across the room, but it’s not like the song is being played right next to you. It’s similar to car speakers, in the way it’s all round you, but not as if you’re listening to the persons car next to you. It’s intimate enough that you feel like it’s YOUR music, not someone else’s near you, but also distant enough that it’s like it’s your own personal concert. \n\nSEPARATION - Always tough because if a song is produced badly, even the greatest ever headphones won’t be able to separate the parts. But in a well produced track, you can actively hear each and every instrument and voice. In “Call it what you want” by Taylor Swift, there’s many instances where there are backing vocals playing over Taylor, and you can hear each one clearly, but as if they’re actually behind her. Like Taylor’s singing into your ear, whilst the backing singer is sat 2 foot behind her also singing, but you can clearly tell one is the main, one is the backing. The 560s definitely struggled with this, you often couldn’t hear the multiple voices, so now listening to many songs, I’m hearing voices I didn’t realise were there (I actually checked on 2 occasions that I wasn’t listening to a remix).\n\nConclusion:\nYes. Just yes. Stellar\n\nSetup I’m using:\nHifiman Arya Organic -> JDS Element 4 -> MacBook M3 -> Audirvana (because Tidal is buggy as anything on Mac since iOS 26 and Apple Music doesn’t auto change the Sample Rate) \n",

I was specifically listening to my favorite release this year, which is Revengeseekerz by Jane Remover. It is a\npretty loud and sometimes harsh electronic album that I've heard many times at this point through DT 990s but not through this setup.\n\nI noticed what I thought was peaking during some parts, but ultimately began to deduce it to the music just not being very well mixed and mastered for high-end listening application, but I'm still not 100% sure. The music is gritty, dirty, and honestly very fun to listen to. \n\nTruthfully the reason why I mention any of this is because I want to keep my things nice and prevent any wear, in other words, I want to protect my investment the best I can but I'm unsure if music like this (or any music) can really be considered \"unsafe\".\n\nI'll add, I am not listening at high volumes during this album, nor do I have anything EQ'd weirdly, it is essentially just a tube amp, a 6SN7 tube, and the headphones.\n\nIf anybody would want to hear what I'm talking\nabout, some songs I was questioning are all by Jane Remover:\n\nDreamflasher, movies for guys, Experimental Skin, search party.\n\nOnce again, I'm aware these songs are supposed to sound gritty, but there are also some more clear and crisp sections in each of these, so I'm trying to decide if I should embrace the grit and imperfections of these songs through the LCD 2c if it's safe, or continue on my Beyers.",

    "title": "A New Study on the Equivalence of Harman OE Target on Modern Test Fixtures, Co-authored by Sean Olive and Dan Clark Audio",
    "selftext": "> Summarized by Qwen.\n\nFor years, the *Harman target*—a frequency response profile derived from extensive double-blind listening tests—has served as a benchmark for “neutral” or preferred headphone sound. Originally defined using a specific GRAS 45CA test fixture equipped with a custom “Welti” pinna and an RA045 (Type 3.3) ear simulator, this target has become widely referenced in both research and product development.\n\nHowever, a critical issue has emerged: many modern labs and manufacturers now use newer test fixtures—such as the **GRAS 45CA-10** (with KB5000 anthropomorphic pinna and RA0402 ear simulator) and the **Brüel & Kjær Type 5128** (featuring a Type 4.3 ear simulator compliant with ITU-T P.57). These fixtures differ acoustically from the original Harman setup, particularly in their **acoustic transfer impedance**, especially below 500 Hz and above 3 kHz. Applying the original Harman target directly to measurements from these newer systems can lead to misinterpretation—and potentially misguided tuning decisions.\n\nIn a new paper presented at the **AES 159th Convention** (October 2025), **Sean Olive** (the architect of the Harman target) and **Dan Clark** address this problem head-on. Their work defines *Harman-equivalent targets* specifically calibrated for the GRAS 45CA-10 and B&K 5128 fixtures, ensuring that headphones tuned to these revised targets will sound subjectively similar to those tuned to the original Harman reference.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe authors measured seven diverse headphones including open-back and closed-back models from Dan Clark Audio, HiFiMan, and Sennheiser—on all three fixtures (original Welti, GRAS 45CA-10, and B&K 5128). Using a straightforward calibration method in Room EQ Wizard (REW), they derived fixture-specific targets by:\n\n1. Measuring each headphone on both the original and new fixtures.\n2. Computing the ratio between responses (e.g., KB5000 / Welti).\n3. Applying this ratio to the original Harman target (phase-conjugated and smoothed) to generate a new, equivalent target.\n\nThis process accounts for the unique acoustic loading and leakage characteristics of each fixture.\n\n## Listening Tests Confirm Validity\n\nTo validate the approach, the team conducted controlled **MUSHRA-style listening tests** with 13 experienced listeners, comparing seven versions of the target:\n\n- The original Harman target (Reference)\n- Fixture-specific targets calibrated per headphone\n- Targets averaged across 7 or 20 headphones\n\nResults were clear: when headphones were equalized to their **fixture-specific, individually calibrated targets**, they sounded **nearly identical** to the original Harman reference. In statistical terms, the **B&K 5128** and **GRAS 45CA-10** targets (calibrated per model) were **not significantly different** from the reference in perceived similarity.\n\nBy contrast, targets derived from **averages across multiple headphones** (e.g., “5128_20”) scored lower—though still within the “very similar” range—highlighting that **individual calibration yields the best match**.\n\nInterestingly, the type of headphone (open vs. closed-back) had minimal impact on results, suggesting the method is robust across designs.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nFor engineers and audiophiles alike, this work resolves a long-standing ambiguity: **you cannot directly apply the classic Harman target to measurements taken on modern fixtures** and expect accurate tuning. Instead, fixture-specific equivalents are needed.\n\nEncouragingly, the differences between targets are often correctable with **simple bass and treble shelving filters**, as most deviations occur in well-defined frequency regions. This opens the door for more consistent, cross-platform headphone evaluation—and more reliable interpretations of published measurements.\n\nWhile the study focused on seven models, the calibration framework is generalizable. Future work may yield standardized correction targets for common fixtures, enabling broader adoption without per-headphone measurement.\n\n## Reference\n\nOlive, S., & Clark, D.

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they’d be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can’t do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I’ve heard from a Sennheiser, it’s not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop… I know what you want me to say, but I don’t hate them. They’re definitely not the headphone I’m going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I’m hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro’s are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you’ve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I’d love to hear other’s perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I’ll get.",

Will this work?\n\nAlso which of this headphone support multiple type of audio format?\n\nthe frequency on xm4 is 40khz and ult is 20khz.

This is erratic and random sometimes it doesn't! This tinnitus type noise goes away after a few seconds! And comes back when music is paused and it's a repeat cycle!(And no this isn't ANC noise coz it happens when even ANC IS OFF and only happens on the left ear driver/ hardware). And for this price i except a premium consistent experience, NOT this!\n\nAnd secondly, also only the left side earpad makes a mild squeaky toy noise when pressed, but right earpad is dead SILENT even when it's pressed. Is this is how it is suppose to be? Also ironically when earpads were interchanged, SURPRISE surprise! STILL only left side earpads makes this mild squeaky noise when pressed and whilst trying to wear it! (Despite the same earpad when on the right driver is dead SILENT and left earpads is silent on right?!)\n\nAnd thirdly!, the return policy is NON-EXISTENT! In my country!  And when asked about it throught their painfully call with executive they said RESET IT which I had already done MULTIPLE TIMES and tried MULTIPLE DEVICES from latest Android, IPAD AND MacBook Pro. Still it's persistent (random and occasional mild white noise/ mechanical noise from left ear driver alone)\n\nThey gave me an ultimatum to even get it checked I HAVE TO Ship my brand new expensive headphone AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND OWN RISK To their warehouse ACROSS THE COUNTRY! And after sonova took over all the service center were closed except one with courier-in type service center!\n\nMany told that the white noise/ TINNITUS issue SPECIFICALLY Left driver one is kinda common. Can you guys as confirm this for me and also other FUTURE BUYERS. Can you check and test in SILENT room with pausing after playing music.\n\nLastly, is this the QUALITY CONTROL by a 'TRUSTED' german brand? And hassle is almost unbearable and everytime I PAUSE I get left ear driver making a very mild tinnitus sound randomly! \n\nu/sennheiserconsumer\n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven’t really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around £20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I’ve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn’t gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around £20 is crazy. \n\nI’ve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I’m no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who’s considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

    "selftext": "First of all I want to emphasize - I'm by no means a audio aficionado, just ur regular hifi enjoyer I would say.  \nStarted my journey in my teens with some cheap ass amp + bookshelf setup which at the time was still way better than anything you could get from the electronic store next door.   \nAnyway back to the topic - HEADPHONES. Been using a lot of \"High-End\" Consumer Devices on the go, Sennheiser, Sony, Bose, \\*cough\\* Apple \\*cough\\* - Jokes aside, and for the past years i've been rocking my AKG K712 Pro at home being driven by my Onboard DAC/Amp on my PC.   \nThe AKG were already a WOW moment for me compared to those big brand Consumer devices at the time and to this day I love those cans. Still going strong after 10 years.   \nSound - Clear, Punchy and no headache even after hours listening at extensive volume. And the Soundstage? Phenomenal. \n\nHaving said that, I hope you got the reference to what I will be comparing the Avantone to.\n\nQuick mention - I do drive my Headphones with the Fiio K11 R2R since a couple weeks, which already improved the sound of the AKG by a mile compared to the onboard solution.\n\n\\- Avantone Planar 2 Impression starts here -\n\nOut of the box first impressions were not too overwhelming, they are fairly unimpressive at first glance from a visual standpoint, the boxy \"cheese grater\" design looks actually kinda nice in the polished black colour I got here tho.  \nBuild quality is very solid, compared to all my previous headphones which were all just big chunks of plastic you get a solid metal frame, fairly thick leather strap which also has the width to spread the enormous weight of the headphones across your head so they actually do NOT feel heavy at all.  \nThe AKG already had comfortable Velour Pads but damn, those Pads on the Avantone are silky smooth and nice to touch.\n\nNow to the sound,\n\nOut-of-the-box: Not to impressive if you ask me. I felt like something was \"missing\" compared to the AKG. Everything felt kinda flat and very narrow in comparison.  \nBy no means did they sound bad, but just.. boring?  \nHaving said that, the low-end did have more punch and they also provided more details in busy passages. It was just uninspired and so narrow, as if you were stuck in a small box.  \nAt that point I was contemplating if the price tag of 429€ was worth it or if I should return them.   \n  \nBut then I gave em another shot after researching a bit and applied an EQ (Self Tweaked Version of the u/Oratory1990 EQ for the first iteration of the Avantone Planar) via APO (Peace Interface) and I was simply shocked.  \nIt really opened up the stage and completely removed the feeling of being boxed in. They take the EQ as if they were made for it.   \n  \nThe low end got even more punch without any signs of being too much for the driver. The midrange is just as detailed as before but the elevated treble is what enhances the whole experience to new heights. As I described earlier everything sounds alive, the stage is wider and most importantly - It's fun! (Which I feel like is a point a lot of people forget to talk about)  \n\n\nBy no means do I have the equipment to measure those things or the extensive knowledge to compare it to hundred other headphones in different price brackets.   \nI cant tell you, especially after applying the EQ, if they follow some imaginary \"perfect\" frequency response curve.  \nAll I can say is - I love those things after applying the EQ and will keep them for a long time to come! \n\nThat is all from me, if there is anything you would like me to add feel free to ask in the comments as this is my first \"review\" I probably missed a ton of important stuff.\n\nCheers y'all!",

    "selftext": "It’s been about a year since I bought the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones, and honestly… I’m done with Bose. The multipoint connection is just terrible.\n\nSometimes when I connect another device, the first one just disconnects for no reason. If I’m on a call and another device connects, it drops the call or randomly switches the audio back to my phone’s speakers — and then I can’t even get the sound back to Bluetooth unless I disconnect and reconnect the headphones.\n\nThe ear detection is also super inconsistent. Sometimes it pauses when I take them off, sometimes it keeps playing even when they’re around my neck. And other times, if I just tilt my head slightly, it pauses for no reason.\n\nBut the absolute worst part? Phone calls. Everyone I talk to keeps saying that they can hear all the background noise around me — sometimes even louder than my own voice. I honestly don’t understand how a company that’s supposed to be the world leader in noise cancellation can’t make headphones that handle calls properly.\n\nAnd to top it off, there’s this constant beep I get every 10 seconds when the connection to a device is lost. You can’t disable it, and it’s infuriating. It basically forces me to turn off multipoint altogether — which defeats the whole point of buying “premium” headphones that are supposed to handle multiple devices smoothly.\n\nI really wanted to love these, but between the connection issues, the unreliable ear detection, and the unusable mic for calls, I just can’t justify Bose anymore.",

My current setup includes the Topping DX5 II, which absolutely shines with electronic genres (rave, techno, acid, house, IDM, EDM) you name it.. It delivers dynamic, crystal-clear audio with a wide soundstage and stunning detail. Paired with the Arya Organic, it's a near-perfect match for me, of course, within this price range.\n\nHowever, when it comes to vocals, film scores, classic rock, or pop, the DX5 II can feel a bit too clinical,,almost overly precise. That’s exactly why I decided to try the K13, hoping for a warmer, more organic presentation thanks to the R2R DAC.\n\nA/B testing starts today, and I’ll share a more detailed review over the weekend. If you’ve got experience with the K13 or other R2R DACs, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

In some ways, they resemble the HE1000SE, though their soundstage feels much smaller compared to both the Sundara and the HEKSE.

Moved the previous Topping E50/L50 stack to my study. No need for any other DAC/amps until something breaks.\n\nThe Antares is for my Stax and the hopefully soon repaired Sennheiser HE-60. More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800. My impression is that it does something pleasing to the staging and shaves off most of the micro details, which can be relaxing depending on the mood and music.

Personally, I’m not a believer in all that snake oil — people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don’t buy it. And honestly, I don’t think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I’ve always thought that if there’s any difference, it’s basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time — I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a “bigger soundstage,” I just assume it’s because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I’m open-minded — I’ll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that’s matched, everything else — bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging — sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I’m out. Either they’re trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don’t. In either case, their opinions don’t mean much to me anymore, because I can’t hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let’s talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn’t tell exactly what at first, but it didn’t feel like my imagination. After more testing — switching headphones, replaying the same tracks — I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head — especially those higher notes — in a way the K7 doesn’t. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that’s somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it’s like their voice locks into one spot — more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** — and I can’t believe I’m saying this — it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you — same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat’s not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer’s right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste — some benefit from that extra space, some don’t. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** — *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn’t huge, but it’s there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It’s actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it’s slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less “exciting.” The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah — I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It’s pricey, and there’s no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat’s my honest take.",

    "selftext": "My thoughts on the Arya Organics (I know there’s plenty of reviews etc, but what harm can another do)\n\nI jumped into this hobby about 2 years ago roughly. Through that time, I’ve been through plenty headphones, but the only ones I spent a LOT of time with was 2. The Arya Stealth, and the HD560s. \n\n(Skip further down if you don’t care about the previous stories)\n\nThe Stealths were mind blowing to me, I did have planars before these. The edition xs (felt way too cheap for the 300 mark at the time. The Ananda Nanos (clamped like a vice). So picked up the Arya Stealths for £710, which was their cheapest price at the time. I owned these for 6 months. Every time I put them on, I was astounded at the sound. However, after 2 months, I rarely used them, I didn’t have the time to listen, and didn’t want £700 lying around. So I reluctantly sold them, and decided to pick up the cheaper pair, the HD560s. So I could still enjoy music, without feeling guilty having some premium set collecting dust. And these were fine, for £90, they were great.\n\nRecently however I’m now in a position where I have a lot more free time, and for that reason, I wanted to pick up a higher end headphone again. I was debating between many, but in the end it kept boiling down to the Stealths, which were now £460. But then saw the Organics were just £120 extra as “open-box” from Hifiman. One thing I absolutely hated with the Stealths was how harsh some of the treble was, and at the time I didn’t have EQ. So I was stuck with harsh treble in a few songs I enjoyed other times. Between owning the 560s and Stealths, I did pick up the JDS Element 4 Dac/Amp in preparation for higher end cans in the future, and to play around with EQ. So hearing the Organics had a harsh treble, it didn’t really deter me as I had the capabilities to town it down.\n\nSo now onto the Organics…\n\nLOOKS:\nThese things are absolutely gorgeous! It’s like taking your grandads beautifully varnished wooden table and chairs, and adding a modern touch to it. It makes them stand out and look far more premium than the price suggests (I’m aware they were 1500 odd on release, but on current pricing, the point stands). They feel more premium for this matter. I the one massive negative, is you have to wear them to listen, meaning I can’t just stare at them when in use. \n\nCOMFORT:\nAnyone who’s familiar with the Arya lineup, know that this line of headphones are on the comfier side of the Hifiman brand. They clamp just enough to not feel loose, but not too hard that it feels like the hulk is crushing your skull (Nanos). Yes the pads aren’t the most comfy pads on any headphone, they’re actually the one aspect I don’t like. They don’t feel premium, and the fabric design sometimes catches the odd strand of hair which isn’t pleasant. However changing these means altering the sound, which you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, want to do. The headband is perfect though. Suspended straps are my favourite on headphones, adds a premium feel, look and feels like far less pressure on your head. Not to mention how wide they are, it helps distribute the weight so well.\n\nUNBOXING: \nDead, £5 unboxing experience, but realistically who cares…\n\nSOUND:\nGrand. Exciting. Smooth. \n\nThe 3 words I’d use to describe the sound. Which goes to show how versatile they are. They give off such a ‘grand’ feeling, when you listen to orchestral pieces, it feels like you’re in a theatre listening to a band playing, but like you’re middle row. Not first row where it feels in your face, and not back row that it feels like it’s far away. It’s that perfect middle ground where it’s around you, but so that you can hear everything so cleanly. They’re exciting in the sense that after an orchestral piece, you put on an EDM track, pop or anything in that region, and it feels like you want to get up and just dance, but don’t, as these probably would fall off your head. And then you go for a very vocal focused piece of music, and the smoothness of the voice just glides through your ears. There’s no moment where it’s aggressive (unless it needs to be) or where it holds back. It’s like an electric supercar. You put your foot down, and it picks up straight away, but with no aggression, just picks up and gets going right away. \n\nOnto the specifics:\n\nBASS - Very solid. Definitely stronger than the Arya Stealths. When I had them, the bass was there, but it needed a tad more punch. These add that very subtle punch, where you know it’s bass, but it doesn’t slip into the other frequencies and overthrow them. It’s controlled VERY well. The sub bass is fantastic too. My favourite song to test this is “The Droid Invasion and the Appearance of Darth Maul” from The Phantom Menace. The drums at the start provide that sub bass test and it really shows how it handles it well. Doesn’t get fatiguing, just presents it so smoothly. Not to mention how clear the drums sound, like you can visualise the fabric drum stick hitting against the massive drum. The bass is also quick when needing to be. In many pop songs where there is the common use of bass, or in rap music, it’ll show the bass, and stop it perfectly. It never feels like it over presents itself. They also hold the bass off so well from overpowering the mids. Many headphones either make the bass so minimal that you don’t realise there should be bass, and many push it so hard it dims down the vocals. These control it so so well.\n\nMIDS - I would say the weakest out of the Low, Mid and High ends. Definitely NOT bad, it’s really really great. However when there is consistent bass present, and a lot of higher end or many many instruments playing, the vocals definitely take a seat back. They’re still very clear, but it pushes the instruments forward a bit more. Which isn’t bad at all, and some people may prefer this. It’s more of a preference thing. I certainly don’t mind it, and it’s not something I’m gonna be quickly to go and EQ, but if I was, it’s the first thing I’d play with, just to bring them forward a touch. BUT, when there’s only a low end and vocals, or high end and vocals, they are stunning. They just sound so real and ‘organic’, it’s like having a conversation with David Attenborough, just so nicely spoken and a voice you wish could commentate on your whole life. \n\nHIGHS - Lies were told here, or obviously it’s just down to personal hearing. But these are NOT ‘peaky’ or ‘harsh’. The high end is so well controlled. With the Arya Stealth, I absolutely could not listen to Nightcall - Kavinsky from Drive. The chorus of the song was so harsh I literally couldn’t listen to it. So the first song I wanted to try was that, and on these I could listen to the entire song with no issues. They have just enough brightness to make everything sound clean and clear, but not too much that it comes across as piercing during songs. Same with Time - Pink Floyd. The start with all the clocks can be very piercing with poorly controlled highs, but it’s like the headphones actively know it’s going to sound harsh and presents them just a tone down so that you don’t have to turn the volume down or skip forward. It was my one worry with these, and although EQ is an option, I did want to enjoy them stock for as long as possible. Which I’m ecstatic with the fact I can.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE - Wide, but not artificially wide, just naturally wide. Like I said with the orchestral hall and being “grand”. It just sounds so perfectly deep. It’s not like the sound is coming from across the room, but it’s not like the song is being played right next to you. It’s similar to car speakers, in the way it’s all round you, but not as if you’re listening to the persons car next to you. It’s intimate enough that you feel like it’s YOUR music, not someone else’s near you, but also distant enough that it’s like it’s your own personal concert. \n\nSEPARATION - Always tough because if a song is produced badly, even the greatest ever headphones won’t be able to separate the parts. But in a well produced track, you can actively hear each and every instrument and voice. In “Call it what you want” by Taylor Swift, there’s many instances where there are backing vocals playing over Taylor, and you can hear each one clearly, but as if they’re actually behind her. Like Taylor’s singing into your ear, whilst the backing singer is sat 2 foot behind her also singing, but you can clearly tell one is the main, one is the backing. The 560s definitely struggled with this, you often couldn’t hear the multiple voices, so now listening to many songs, I’m hearing voices I didn’t realise were there (I actually checked on 2 occasions that I wasn’t listening to a remix).\n\nConclusion:\nYes. Just yes. Stellar\n\nSetup I’m using:\nHifiman Arya Organic -> JDS Element 4 -> MacBook M3 -> Audirvana (because Tidal is buggy as anything on Mac since iOS 26 and Apple Music doesn’t auto change the Sample Rate) \n",

    "title": "A New Study on the Equivalence of Harman OE Target on Modern Test Fixtures, Co-authored by Sean Olive and Dan Clark Audio",
    "selftext": "> Summarized by Qwen.\n\nFor years, the *Harman target*—a frequency response profile derived from extensive double-blind listening tests—has served as a benchmark for “neutral” or preferred headphone sound. Originally defined using a specific GRAS 45CA test fixture equipped with a custom “Welti” pinna and an RA045 (Type 3.3) ear simulator, this target has become widely referenced in both research and product development.\n\nHowever, a critical issue has emerged: many modern labs and manufacturers now use newer test fixtures—such as the **GRAS 45CA-10** (with KB5000 anthropomorphic pinna and RA0402 ear simulator) and the **Brüel & Kjær Type 5128** (featuring a Type 4.3 ear simulator compliant with ITU-T P.57). These fixtures differ acoustically from the original Harman setup, particularly in their **acoustic transfer impedance**, especially below 500 Hz and above 3 kHz. Applying the original Harman target directly to measurements from these newer systems can lead to misinterpretation—and potentially misguided tuning decisions.\n\nIn a new paper presented at the **AES 159th Convention** (October 2025), **Sean Olive** (the architect of the Harman target) and **Dan Clark** address this problem head-on. Their work defines *Harman-equivalent targets* specifically calibrated for the GRAS 45CA-10 and B&K 5128 fixtures, ensuring that headphones tuned to these revised targets will sound subjectively similar to those tuned to the original Harman reference.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe authors measured seven diverse headphones including open-back and closed-back models from Dan Clark Audio, HiFiMan, and Sennheiser—on all three fixtures (original Welti, GRAS 45CA-10, and B&K 5128). Using a straightforward calibration method in Room EQ Wizard (REW), they derived fixture-specific targets by:\n\n1. Measuring each headphone on both the original and new fixtures.\n2. Computing the ratio between responses (e.g., KB5000 / Welti).\n3. Applying this ratio to the original Harman target (phase-conjugated and smoothed) to generate a new, equivalent target.\n\nThis process accounts for the unique acoustic loading and leakage characteristics of each fixture.\n\n## Listening Tests Confirm Validity\n\nTo validate the approach, the team conducted controlled **MUSHRA-style listening tests** with 13 experienced listeners, comparing seven versions of the target:\n\n- The original Harman target (Reference)\n- Fixture-specific targets calibrated per headphone\n- Targets averaged across 7 or 20 headphones\n\nResults were clear: when headphones were equalized to their **fixture-specific, individually calibrated targets**, they sounded **nearly identical** to the original Harman reference. In statistical terms, the **B&K 5128** and **GRAS 45CA-10** targets (calibrated per model) were **not significantly different** from the reference in perceived similarity.\n\nBy contrast, targets derived from **averages across multiple headphones** (e.g., “5128_20”) scored lower—though still within the “very similar” range—highlighting that **individual calibration yields the best match**.\n\nInterestingly, the type of headphone (open vs. closed-back) had minimal impact on results, suggesting the method is robust across designs.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nFor engineers and audiophiles alike, this work resolves a long-standing ambiguity: **you cannot directly apply the classic Harman target to measurements taken on modern fixtures** and expect accurate tuning. Instead, fixture-specific equivalents are needed.\n\nEncouragingly, the differences between targets are often correctable with **simple bass and treble shelving filters**, as most deviations occur in well-defined frequency regions. This opens the door for more consistent, cross-platform headphone evaluation—and more reliable interpretations of published measurements.\n\nWhile the study focused on seven models, the calibration framework is generalizable. Future work may yield standardized correction targets for common fixtures, enabling broader adoption without per-headphone measurement.\n\n## Reference\n\nOlive, S., & Clark, D.

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they’d be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can’t do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I’ve heard from a Sennheiser, it’s not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop… I know what you want me to say, but I don’t hate them. They’re definitely not the headphone I’m going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I’m hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro’s are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you’ve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I’d love to hear other’s perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I’ll get.",

Till i took my headphones out and realised there was still music coming from my speakers ha!\n\nSo I tried with just the headphones and the sub and it filled the bass pretty well, its like getting the details from the headphones and yet being able to feel the bass in the room. Now i occasionally do it once in a while and it works really well with open backs that lacks a bit of bass!\n\nOf cos you do not want to try it with your IEMS\n\n",

Either it sounded dull, the UX was bad or I just plain didn't like using it.\n\nHaving tried mostly chinese stuff, I finally wanted to try something completly different and it paid off.\n\nMy recent purchase was the Lake People G101 a simple, anlog headphone amp. No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240€, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits. Let's hope I don't need them but it's nice to see thought given to that part of the device. Also designed and built in Germany for my fellow r/BuyFromEU volks.\n\nThe DAC on-top is a Topping D10s, one of the first HiFi products I got and it runs great too. What can I say: It's a DAC. Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice. But other than that I am so happy and juet feel peace with this setup. It sounds great, has lots of power and will hopefully last me a long time.",

This is erratic and random sometimes it doesn't! This tinnitus type noise goes away after a few seconds! And comes back when music is paused and it's a repeat cycle!(And no this isn't ANC noise coz it happens when even ANC IS OFF and only happens on the left ear driver/ hardware). And for this price i except a premium consistent experience, NOT this!\n\nAnd secondly, also only the left side earpad makes a mild squeaky toy noise when pressed, but right earpad is dead SILENT even when it's pressed. Is this is how it is suppose to be? Also ironically when earpads were interchanged, SURPRISE surprise! STILL only left side earpads makes this mild squeaky noise when pressed and whilst trying to wear it! (Despite the same earpad when on the right driver is dead SILENT and left earpads is silent on right?!)\n\nAnd thirdly!, the return policy is NON-EXISTENT! In my country!  And when asked about it throught their painfully call with executive they said RESET IT which I had already done MULTIPLE TIMES and tried MULTIPLE DEVICES from latest Android, IPAD AND MacBook Pro. Still it's persistent (random and occasional mild white noise/ mechanical noise from left ear driver alone)\n\nThey gave me an ultimatum to even get it checked I HAVE TO Ship my brand new expensive headphone AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND OWN RISK To their warehouse ACROSS THE COUNTRY! And after sonova took over all the service center were closed except one with courier-in type service center!\n\nMany told that the white noise/ TINNITUS issue SPECIFICALLY Left driver one is kinda common. Can you guys as confirm this for me and also other FUTURE BUYERS. Can you check and test in SILENT room with pausing after playing music.\n\nLastly, is this the QUALITY CONTROL by a 'TRUSTED' german brand? And hassle is almost unbearable and everytime I PAUSE I get left ear driver making a very mild tinnitus sound randomly! \n\nu/sennheiserconsumer\n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven’t really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around £20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I’ve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn’t gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around £20 is crazy. \n\nI’ve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I’m no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who’s considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "selftext": "I’ve been trying to get my (old) Skyrim setup to not only stream onto my deck, but also to be able to start it from my deck - which has a layer of complication, as I normally start it through a non-Steam program.\n\nWhen I start it through the third-party program, everything works fine. Steam Input remaps the Deck controls to KBM and I use my normal setup.\n\nWhen I start it through Steam (even just starting the third-party program through Steam as a non-Steam game), I cannot access any controls on my Steam Deck with Skyrim set to use KBM. If I switch Skyrim to controller, the Steam Deck controls start working, but cannot be configured through Steam Input.\n\nI think the issue has to do with Skyrim’s KBM/controller exclusivity - it refuses to run both at the same time. Something about starting any part of it in Steam forces the game to recognize the Steam Deck as a controller, instead of following the Steam Input mappings.\n\nThere’s a launch option for SteamDeck=0 that can apparently be used, but since I’m not launching Skyrim directly, it doesn’t get run for Skyrim itself. Steam Overlay is enabled on everything, as is Steam Input.\n\nIf anyone’s got any bypasses they know of, I’d love to hear them. I’ve spent several days poking through old threads on a number of different sites.",

    "selftext": "Hello! I’ve recently got COD World At War and everything seems to be running fine. However I have an issue regarding the zoom/aiming using left trigger.\n\nRather than the aim automatically zooming out when releasing the trigger, I’d have to tap the trigger again to manually zoom out. I’ve been mostly playing this game on the 360 so this is pretty hard to get used to.\n\nNow I did mess with the control settings and manually added the release commands. This did work for a bit, but unfortunately once I start sprinting, I end up being stuck zoomed in.\n\nIs there any way around this? Thank you so much!",

Currently trying to get a sinden lightgun to work with it, and it looks like I have to rollback the firmware and or disable the joystick mode which means accessing the sinden software which only in possible through windows. As the title states the solution I've been pointed to is to get windows flashed to this micro sd and using the boot menu to load windows from it so I can do windows shit with this guns software to get it running. Im having issues when trying to use balena etcher to flash the image as it gives me a missing partitions error.. Been looking into ways to solve this which pointer to using kde partition manager to format the card properly but when I get the card selected in it kde tells me I won't be able to edit it? Been looking into trying to use something  like proton tricks which I already have on the deck but when I try to open the mediacretiontool.exe via proton tricks and this is where I am currently lost. There are only 2 prefixes to select one of them being  the sinden driver i was running in desktop the only other being the house of the dead as an application. I don't even know how these got added lol Or if im even barking up the wrong tree. My goal is mostly just to get windows access on here, any help is greatly appreciated ✌ ",

    "title": "Can't ReImage SteamDeck",
    "selftext": "My SteamDeck has been pretty buggy ever since I got it a few years ago. I've always had trouble updating it. A few weeks ago I finally got tired of the poor performance and the freezing when I try to do updates, so I decided to try a factory reset. I was unable to do this - it kept telling me that I wasn't connected to the internet even though I was. I did some digging and found that reimaging the deck might help.\n\nI'm following the directions here: [https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227)\n\nAt first I was using a Windows computer so I downloaded first rufus-4.9 and then tried rufus-4.10\\_BETA. I had to purchase a thumbdrive because I didn't have anything that would go into SteamDeck's ports or any adapters so I got this: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSW6375K?ref=ppx\\_yo2ov\\_dt\\_b\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSW6375K?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)\n\nI downloaded the file from here: [https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck&snr=100601\\_\\_\\_](https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck&snr=100601___)\n\nI opened up rufus (I've tried both the versions I listed above with the same results) and I've uploaded both the zipped up folder and an extracted file from the folder at different times to see if that made a difference (hasn't seemed to but it would make more sense for the extracted file to be the right way to do things?).\n\nI powered on the deck while holding volume up, and then went to the boot manager, plugged in the thumbdrive, and then selected the EFI USB Device and that's where progress stops.\n\nAfter I select the EFI USB my SteamDeck will show the Steam logo for a few seconds before displaying a bunch of processes in code. I'm not someone who understands any of that but a couple of the times its done this its had several different errors at different times.\n\nOne of the errors was something along the lines of \"failed to start append steamos\" and another time one was something along the lines of \"failed to start flush journal to persistent storage.\"\n\nAt this point in general I could not use menus to turn on, turn off, or restart the SteamDeck. I could only hold the power button to change the on/off state. I couldn't install anything, updates or otherwise - when it displayed an installing screen I got the three minutes progress bar and when I got to 1 second left it stopped - one night I literally left it on that screen for six hours and no progress. I could only access the select language and select internet menus sometimes but could never go further than that because then it begins installing...something again and I hit that forever one second away situation.\n\nToday I used a brand new Macbook Pro running Sequioa 15.6 with BalenaEtcher to start the whole process over. I powered on the deck while holding volume up, and then went to the boot manager, plugged in the thumbdrive, and then selected the EFI USB Device. It did some stuff I didn't understand, went black, and according to the instructions I needed to wait there away if it stayed black. I waited for two hours and it seemed the Deck went to sleep so I pushed the power button once. Now its running through endless code really fast and I have no hope of understanding it. Its been doing this for at least three hours now.\n\nI'm pulling my hair out. I've already made one purchase to fix the thing, I've used several versions of rufus, and now I've tried balenaEtcher. I've deleted and redownloaded and deleted and redownloaded the image file multiple times, reformatted the thumbdrive multiple times, and tried to boot with the USB from boot manager several times. Its like a death spiral. What am I missing? I'm not a computer coder so this is already frustrating and over my head.\n\n  \nEdit: Fixed a typo and a timeline error.",

(it has an american plug, despite the seller and me both being germans, in germany. somehow. lol)  \nHe sent me a dock along aswell, but it's not much more than a fancy stand as long as the deck keeps dying on me everytime I use it... I know it has an official battery life of like, 2 hours, give or take, but I didn't think it would be this bad. Battery health is at 90-something percent btw.\n  \nAre there any solutions, or workaround maybe? External powerbanks? More powerful chargers? Not using those multi-sockets that also power the rest of the setup? Full battery replacement??!?  \n  \nThe main problem, all things considered, is that it still empties the battery even when plugged in.  \nIt's actively getting in the way of me using it as a stationary computer, or using it anywhere else for more than a few hours a day, despite extensive access to charging cables and wall sockets.  \nman :(",

(empty bars)\n* I can start the installation of a game through **Desktop Mode**, but it always freezes at around **90% completion**.\n* When the issue happens and I close Steam, I can still hear the **fans running**, as if something is still active in the background.\n\nWhat I’ve already tried:\n\n* **Hard reboot** (holding Power for 10–12 seconds).\n* **Launching Steam from BIOS** after reboot.\n* Removing and testing without **SD card**.\n* Checked for **updates** — SteamOS is fully up to date.\n\nThe rest of the UI works fine, and the system doesn’t freeze — it just seems like something breaks in the Steam Game Mode layer once a game page is opened.\n\nHas anyone else run into this or found a fix?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Which may be me getting old, but if there's anything to be done here or if others are having the same issue I'd appreciate hearing it\n\nThe not playing these until recently I mention because I'm sure many of the people I play against have been playing these games on and off for 20 years, but I was very good at FPS games, especially on PC, stuff like CS, Quake 3, etc.\n\nThe controls I mention because I'm running custom controls with track pad as my primary look option and gyro enabled, which works for single player but may not cut it for MP,so if there are existing community layouts or even the default layout that any of you use successfully id love to know so I can give it a try\n\nThanks all, hoping it's not just me losing my edge, it's a fun game but I'm going 1-20 most games\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all. 🙂 I’m aware this is a bit niche/adjacent to normal interests here but I’m trying to make my Windows 11 PC (which is connected to a TV) work more or less the same as my Steam Deck (connected to same TV).\n\nThus far I’ve gotten a few things sorted:\n\n- Go to sleep so it can be woken without using power button\n- App that turns HDR on and off when certain games are opened/closed\n- Minimum stuff installed just to make Steam work with a PS5 DualSense\n- Windows passcode disabled\n- Steam Big Picture launches on boot\n\nThis gets you surprisingly close to the SteamDeck docked experience, but there are some things Windows just can’t seem to do, at least not with my hardware:\n\n- Wake from sleep only works with my keyboard or mouse, Windows just won’t listen to the PS5 controller via Bluetooth adapter (apparently older Xbox adapters could do this but not newer ones, and I want DualSense for the gyro and track pad à la Steam Deck)\n\n- There is no HDMI-CEC integration so the PC can’t turn the TV on\n\n- Desktop mouse control via controller doesn’t work properly, the pointer is there but the actual cursor icon is invisible unless I’m in a game, even when I have desktop controls set up in Steam\n\nI have used an LG-specific companion app that lets you send signals to the TV via network to change the input, but it’s very janky.\n\nI’m putting this out there in case anyone has tackled these issues and/or has further tips for a better integration.\n\nSome extra points worth noting:\n\n- I’d rather just do this without Windows but unfortunately a number of multiplayer games I play are Windows-only due to anti-cheat measures\n\n- I’m looking forward to the ‘Xbox mode’ Windows updates happening in the future helping with some of this as I suspect they’re going to try to launch console-feel PCs\n\n- Some of my issues at face value should work so hoping for others who’ve had hands-on experience with this",

    "selftext": "I’ve been trying to get my (old) Skyrim setup to not only stream onto my deck, but also to be able to start it from my deck - which has a layer of complication, as I normally start it through a non-Steam program.\n\nWhen I start it through the third-party program, everything works fine. Steam Input remaps the Deck controls to KBM and I use my normal setup.\n\nWhen I start it through Steam (even just starting the third-party program through Steam as a non-Steam game), I cannot access any controls on my Steam Deck with Skyrim set to use KBM. If I switch Skyrim to controller, the Steam Deck controls start working, but cannot be configured through Steam Input.\n\nI think the issue has to do with Skyrim’s KBM/controller exclusivity - it refuses to run both at the same time. Something about starting any part of it in Steam forces the game to recognize the Steam Deck as a controller, instead of following the Steam Input mappings.\n\nThere’s a launch option for SteamDeck=0 that can apparently be used, but since I’m not launching Skyrim directly, it doesn’t get run for Skyrim itself. Steam Overlay is enabled on everything, as is Steam Input.\n\nIf anyone’s got any bypasses they know of, I’d love to hear them. I’ve spent several days poking through old threads on a number of different sites.",

Which may be me getting old, but if there's anything to be done here or if others are having the same issue I'd appreciate hearing it\n\nThe not playing these until recently I mention because I'm sure many of the people I play against have been playing these games on and off for 20 years, but I was very good at FPS games, especially on PC, stuff like CS, Quake 3, etc.\n\nThe controls I mention because I'm running custom controls with track pad as my primary look option and gyro enabled, which works for single player but may not cut it for MP,so if there are existing community layouts or even the default layout that any of you use successfully id love to know so I can give it a try\n\nThanks all, hoping it's not just me losing my edge, it's a fun game but I'm going 1-20 most games\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial “security fog” systems shops use — the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it’s harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I’ve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2–3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI’m trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I’m trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that’s actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won’t wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20–30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** – Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the “safe default” for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** – Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that’s meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** – Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** – if anyone has done the “alarm → webhook/SMS → Pi → relay → device” pattern, I’d love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it’s just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = “leave now.”\n\nIf this isn’t allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

Hey? Ridiculous, right? Luckily my own smart locks were fine, and I haven’t installed any cloud-based camera systems at home yet, so I dodged that one.\n\nMeanwhile, I noticed that my company’s devices (cameras and the smart lock) just… worked. I didn’t even notice anything was wrong. Unlocking, fingerprint, logs... all handled locally. No cloud delay, no “server error,” nothing. (Not naming brands or models here, don’t want it to sound like an ad.)\n\nIt actually made me realize how invisible reliability feels.... you don’t notice it until everyone else loses it. No strong opinions here, just sharing a small takeaway: local-first might not sound sexy, but when half the web goes dark, it suddenly feels very smart.\n\nAnyone else got hit by the AWS outage?",

    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate.

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess. \n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Hi! \n\nWhen it comes to home automation, I am clueless! \nI myself am a software engineer, I understand networking, can do things without a GUI. \n\nI have a hifi setup consisting of a preamp, amp, dac and a raspberry pi streamer built on moode.\n\nI want to somehow automate turning on all the devices once I start playing music over streamer. \n\nThe streamer is always on and I can detect music playing state programatically. Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home. Rpi cannot be hidden well due to fairly weak wifi reception\n\nThanks guys! ",

The issue I am seeing with this is that the this will only work as long as my phone is within range of the lighbulbs. I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue. Had my phone on airplane mode during when the lights were supposed to turn on and they did. ",

    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

Thanks for your guidance!\n\nPs this would also work great in a residential bathroom: occupancy sensors and bathrooms are great except when it's the middle of the night!",

    "selftext": "Good evening Homeautomation Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-\n\nCables in Wall Mounted Box:\n\n1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.\n\n2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and\n\n3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.\n\nI have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.\n\nPURCHASED EQUIPMENT-\n\nI just purchased which I have not received yet.\n\n1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE. But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.\n\n2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.\n\n3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24\n\n4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen\n\n5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power, (PDUMH15)\n\n6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7\" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.\n\n7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?\n\nCONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-\n\nAll of this will connect to Home Assistant through a\n\n1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.\n\n2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware\n\nThe ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.\n\nADVICE-\n\nBased on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?\n\nI also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.\n\nThe current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.\n\nShould I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.\n\nI am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.\n\nI anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea.

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

Hey? Ridiculous, right? Luckily my own smart locks were fine, and I haven’t installed any cloud-based camera systems at home yet, so I dodged that one.\n\nMeanwhile, I noticed that my company’s devices (cameras and the smart lock) just… worked. I didn’t even notice anything was wrong. Unlocking, fingerprint, logs... all handled locally. No cloud delay, no “server error,” nothing. (Not naming brands or models here, don’t want it to sound like an ad.)\n\nIt actually made me realize how invisible reliability feels.... you don’t notice it until everyone else loses it. No strong opinions here, just sharing a small takeaway: local-first might not sound sexy, but when half the web goes dark, it suddenly feels very smart.\n\nAnyone else got hit by the AWS outage?",

    "title": "DIY “security fog” deterrent that auto-triggers from my alarm - Where to get safe fog canisters + how to build the dispenser?",
    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial “security fog” systems shops use — the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it’s harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I’ve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2–3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI’m trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I’m trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that’s actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won’t wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20–30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** – Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the “safe default” for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** – Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that’s meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** – Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** – if anyone has done the “alarm → webhook/SMS → Pi → relay → device” pattern, I’d love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it’s just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = “leave now.”\n\nIf this isn’t allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate.

I see so many out there. \n\nAlso I have a Nest Gen 3 thermostat, it seems like I can't directly integrate it, is it worth getting and API to do that or better to buy a different one, and any recommendations?  \n\nI currently have Eufy cameras, first alert smoke alarms, Govee lights, and switch bot vacuum and curtain openers. \n\nSorry for the long post, thanks in advance.

The issue I am seeing with this is that the this will only work as long as my phone is within range of the lighbulbs. I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue. Had my phone on airplane mode during when the lights were supposed to turn on and they did. ",

It's the middle of the night so I tried to ignore it and sleep.\n\nWhy the hell doesn't the \"smart\" smoke detector that tells me when it's testing itself, send me messages when I'm cooking bacon, not tell me during waking hours the batteries are low?  Why not a message \"your batteries are getting low, it's time to change them?\" Instead the stupid beep.  \n\nThe damn thing knows what time it is.  Knows my location.  Knows I'm a sleep.  And it has enough power to beep every 10 damn minutes all God damn night. It has enough power to stay connected to the Internet.  Has enough power to run a test when I hit the button on the app hoping it would shut off the damn beep.\n\nI can silence actual smoke detection in my house on the app but can't silence the damn low battery beep?  \n\nI'm so angry.  \n\nRant over.",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial “security fog” systems shops use — the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it’s harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I’ve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2–3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI’m trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I’m trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that’s actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won’t wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20–30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** – Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the “safe default” for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** – Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that’s meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** – Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** – if anyone has done the “alarm → webhook/SMS → Pi → relay → device” pattern, I’d love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it’s just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = “leave now.”\n\nIf this isn’t allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "After that conversation with a fellow Redditor about bringnox smart shades, I ended up ordering six units this year. I've even started recommending them to my clients (yes, I do professional home installation). Here's my detailed experience:\n\nThe ordering form is well-organized with clear categories. I didn't trust screen colors for fabric selection at the beginning. Since I wanted to verify both color accuracy and texture, I ordered their fabric sample book before my first purchase. For anyone with similar concerns, the swatches are totally worth the small investment and so cheap.\n\nTheir measurement video guide is fantastic – I followed it precisely. I measured top/middle/bottom of the window frame and used the smallest dimension (to ensure the shade would fit).\nInstallation is DIY-friendly for anyone moderately handy. The process is straightforward, and I just do: mark level screw positions, drill pilot holes, secure two brackets with a screwdriver, and then it can click the shade into place. Maybe some prople is no need to find the professional helps.\n\nConnecting to my Alexa system was painless. Their instructions are wonderfully clear with minimal steps - maybe the most beginner-friendly setup I've seen.",

Therefore, I can no longer download the Innogy app. Supposedly there's a way to still use everything locally, but I'd like to connect it to the rest of my smart home...\n\n\n\nDoes anyone still use the Innogy RWE stuff today? \n\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "We recently put in 3 La Cantina bifold doors, 2 in the living room and 1 in the master bedroom right above the living room. Also put in a balcony coming off the master.  (Pics attached)\n\nProjects been done for a couple months and we are realizing 2 things\n1) all 3 are southwest facing and the sun is really bright and in your face mid-afternoon on\n2) tons of bugs come in if we leave the doors open in the evening\n\nUnfortunately, we didn’t order any screens to go with the door. \n\nI’d like something that would help with the sun issue and the bug issue. Screen seem to make the most sense but I know it’s going to away from the “clean” look of the doors currently as the canister of the screen will be mounted above the doors or to the side.  It is what it is. Open to other suggestions too (hanging outdoor shades off the balcony far edge to block sunlight in the living room, retractable awning for the 2nd floor master bedroom, etc). \n\nWhat have people used and liked? I don’t mind having it installed but am fairly handy so can tackle an intermediate level DIY project. \n1) large opening slide screens? (Looking at wizard, mirage, Apollo)\n2) large opening motorized screens that comes down from the top? (Genius, wizard, I’m sure others)\n\nIt would be nice to use automation (plan on integrating home assistant into the house soon) to open and close the screen… so smart motorized options seem appealing.

Unfortunately range issues still exist such that the two farthest bulbs seem to disconnect. Usually individually, today as a pair. I'm going to reset and move my extender, but it's starting to be a headache. I recently started with the Tapo bridge to fold in kasa with the tapo dimmer / button, which doesn't seem to work from the start. It says I've paired the two bulbs, but only one seems to dim per the button, but both do turn on (and maybe not off). I specifically purchased the bridge to accommodate this. Does anyone have any insight, besides just trying to reset, relocate or reboot? I'm considering going full into Homeassistant, but I have enough moving parts at the moment, if anyone has insight on making the switch.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don’t support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man… there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is “THE SMARTEST”... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere’s what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren’t essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it’s like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world’s “smart homes” catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you’re running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit “nerd level 3000”... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like… what’s the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I’m starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone’s found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I’m cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn’t depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

Any help would be appreciated",

    "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nWinter is coming and mornings are getting darker every day and they will be in my neck of woods for the next 4-monhts. I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys, thanks for all the great ideas I’ve found here, my smart home setup’s been going pretty smoothly. I’ve got the basics covered so far: a dishwasher, robot vacuum for cleaning, AC and central ventilation, a smart lock and cameras for security, plus whole-house lighting control and electric curtains.\n\nNow I’m thinking of adding something a bit different next, maybe for the shower room or the room that opens onto the balcony. I’ve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it’s on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI’m also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I’m leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven’t found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you’ve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I’d love to hear what worked for you. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone !\n\nThis is my beginning in the world of smart homes. I’m not a complete noob as I’m pretty tech savvy, but here, I’m really stumped.\n\n  \nI bought a Tuya keybox (this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref\\_=pe\\_111711481\\_1111265561\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title&th=1](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CGV3KGSP?ref_=pe_111711481_1111265561_i_fed_asin_title&th=1) ) for a really simple use case : I want to put my keys inside and be able to open it remotely if someone needs them.\n\n  \nI could give them a code that I set beforehand of course, but it might happen that they need to get in when I’m not here and I didn’t plan for them to come.\n\n  \nI naively thought the keybox would connect to wifi, but it’s only bluetooth and so I bought a tuya gateway too, the specific model that was advertised to be compatible with the keybox, this one : [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref\\_=pe\\_109071451\\_1103836691\\_i\\_fed\\_asin\\_title](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B096NQNHGZ?ref_=pe_109071451_1103836691_i_fed_asin_title)\n\n  \nIt was a NIGHTMARE to set up, because you actually have to NOT follow the instructions on the manual but instead look at the amazon page where it tells you the correct way to connect, but I managed to do it.\n\n  \nNow, I got my Tuya app with my keybox and my gateway. Great. But I still can’t connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I’ve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn’t change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically… but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn’t detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I’m missing ? A secret step ?",

I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while.

I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "title": "Dark Apartment - need ideas / solutions",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

No filters or humidifiers or anything else in the system. We currently have a gen 1 nest, which they just dropped support for and no longer works with the app. We are in the Apple ecosystem. The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit? Looking at the ecobee and the nest, but not sure if either one will give us an advantage with our current setup.\n\nThoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

However, I need to buy some cordless lamps for places where I’m not able to plug a lamp in. Unfortunately, IKEA doesn’t sell a cordless bulb. I really don’t want to end up having to keep track of and use a remote for each bulb. IKEA can link up to my Apple home. Are there any cordless bulbs that would easily be turned on in a group? Or at least multiple cordless bulbs that connect to one remote?",

    "selftext": "Hi, I need some advice please.  I have a Netatmo Presence which is wired in near the front door, but the light has broken and I'm considering changing the setup for a Reolink WiFi Doorbell and a friendly looking outdoor light with a Zigbee bulb which can turn on when the doorbell senses a person/vehicle etc or the bell is triggered.\n\nThe only power in the immediate area is currently the light switch indoors which powers the Presence, which is mains power (UK, 240V).  I have actually taken the switch out and have the wires connected permanently behind a blanking plate so the Presence is always on. There are no 3 pin plug sockets nearby.  I see that the Reolink doorbell runs on 24V supply, so would need a transformer.  It is supplied with one which plugs in, but that's not going to work here.  Can I add a transformer in parallel with the supply for the new light fitting? It would need quite a bit of space creation in the wall.\n\nAm I over-complicating things? Is this easier than I'm thinking? Am I better off getting a battery version?\nThanks for your help.",

Any suggestions (or even setup tips) would be massively appreciated!",

Not after battery changes, just randomly. Over time one of my indoor sensors has become completely undetectable.\n\nI'm looking to upgrade but honestly I'm not very impressed with my Grovee experience. Maybe I just bought the wrong model? There seem to be so many different options of Grovee set ups, some of which have been talked about here but I'm afraid of a repeat performance from a new Grovee set up. Is there a better option out there? What have you been using and for how long?\n\nMy Desires:\n\n- Amazon Alexa (I would like to be able to link to Alexa so I can ask temp/humidity of certain sensors)\n- Android Widget Option\n- Less than $200 for set up (5 sensors preferred)",

    "selftext": "After that conversation with a fellow Redditor about bringnox smart shades, I ended up ordering six units this year. I've even started recommending them to my clients (yes, I do professional home installation). Here's my detailed experience:\n\nThe ordering form is well-organized with clear categories. I didn't trust screen colors for fabric selection at the beginning. Since I wanted to verify both color accuracy and texture, I ordered their fabric sample book before my first purchase. For anyone with similar concerns, the swatches are totally worth the small investment and so cheap.\n\nTheir measurement video guide is fantastic – I followed it precisely. I measured top/middle/bottom of the window frame and used the smallest dimension (to ensure the shade would fit).\nInstallation is DIY-friendly for anyone moderately handy. The process is straightforward, and I just do: mark level screw positions, drill pilot holes, secure two brackets with a screwdriver, and then it can click the shade into place. Maybe some prople is no need to find the professional helps.\n\nConnecting to my Alexa system was painless. Their instructions are wonderfully clear with minimal steps - maybe the most beginner-friendly setup I've seen.",

What are the best brands (a durable brand)?\n2. What are some of the factors I should look for when buying one, especially features like sensors, voice control, and temperature regulation?\n\nI’m looking for something comfortable, durable, and worth the price.",

Screen seem to make the most sense but I know it’s going to away from the “clean” look of the doors currently as the canister of the screen will be mounted above the doors or to the side.  It is what it is. Open to other suggestions too (hanging outdoor shades off the balcony far edge to block sunlight in the living room, retractable awning for the 2nd floor master bedroom, etc). \n\nWhat have people used and liked? I don’t mind having it installed but am fairly handy so can tackle an intermediate level DIY project. \n1) large opening slide screens? (Looking at wizard, mirage, Apollo)\n2) large opening motorized screens that comes down from the top? (Genius, wizard, I’m sure others)\n\nIt would be nice to use automation (plan on integrating home assistant into the house soon) to open and close the screen… so smart motorized options seem appealing.

I recently started with the Tapo bridge to fold in kasa with the tapo dimmer / button, which doesn't seem to work from the start.

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don’t support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man… there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is “THE SMARTEST”... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere’s what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren’t essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it’s like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world’s “smart homes” catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you’re running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit “nerd level 3000”... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like… what’s the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I’m starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone’s found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I’m cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn’t depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

The only way to add a switch is by using IFTTT. How do I do this? I’ve only set IFTTT rules on my phone, but this would be an IFTTT rule between two devices in my flat not using my phone. Can I create an IFTTT rule on my phone (“if left switch is turned on, left socket turns on”, etc) that will then work even when my phone is not involved (ie offline)?",

I’ve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it’s on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI’m also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these?

    "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nWinter is coming and mornings are getting darker every day and they will be in my neck of woods for the next 4-monhts. I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

    "selftext": "After that conversation with a fellow Redditor about bringnox smart shades, I ended up ordering six units this year. I've even started recommending them to my clients (yes, I do professional home installation). Here's my detailed experience:\n\nThe ordering form is well-organized with clear categories. I didn't trust screen colors for fabric selection at the beginning. Since I wanted to verify both color accuracy and texture, I ordered their fabric sample book before my first purchase. For anyone with similar concerns, the swatches are totally worth the small investment and so cheap.\n\nTheir measurement video guide is fantastic – I followed it precisely. I measured top/middle/bottom of the window frame and used the smallest dimension (to ensure the shade would fit).\nInstallation is DIY-friendly for anyone moderately handy. The process is straightforward, and I just do: mark level screw positions, drill pilot holes, secure two brackets with a screwdriver, and then it can click the shade into place. Maybe some prople is no need to find the professional helps.\n\nConnecting to my Alexa system was painless. Their instructions are wonderfully clear with minimal steps - maybe the most beginner-friendly setup I've seen.",

    "title": "Bluetti is finally getting a official Smart Home Integration!",
    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don’t support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "Hey all, hoping this subreddit is where I should go with this!\n\nI just put together a new PC build last week, and I got a Lian Li case with two HDD cages for internal older mechanical drives which I planned to use as archives/backups. From my old PC last week, I started doing the backups on there since I had to buy a new drive. \n\nI'm now running on a new **ASUS ProArt x870-E mobo**. I got an 8TB Seagate Barracuda drive, and was given 2 3TB Toshiba drives. One Toshiba was DOA, leading to the Barracuda. \n\nIn order for them to show up on my old HP Omen build while docked, I had to use diskpart cmd commands and format the disk that way, because it would show up as a 2TB drive (only in disk management, not explorer) but with the other 6TB as Unallocated Space. I got it recognized and formatted/mounted, then spent a day copying data for my archives over.\n\nWhen I put together the new build, I have these two drives into the bottom two data pins on the mobo, and they are showing up in Disk Management, but the same as before on the Omen, with the 2TB/Rest of the space unallocated. I checked the device/driver details, and it has the \"*Device settings for SCSI\\\\Disk&Ven\\_&Prod\\_ST8000DM004-2U91\\\\7&16843f94&0&020000 were not migrated from previous OS installation due to partial or ambiguous device match.\"* from when I first turned on the new build.\n\nI was just doing some switching on the fan headers to tidy things up and took the drives out, then docked them with my external drive dock to check the drives. Hooked up with that through USB, they read exactly as I'd left them on the Omen computer. But when I hooked them up directly to the mobo again, I'm back to the 2TB/Unallocated.\n\nI'll share screenshots here, sorry if I do this linking wrong. \n\n\\[url=https://postimg.cc/t7WcRKfW\\]\\[img\\]https://i.postimg.cc/t7WcRKfW/Barracuda-showing-Unallocated.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]\n\n\\[url=https://postimg.cc/vDfK8JjW\\]\\[img\\]https://i.postimg.cc/vDfK8JjW/Toshiba-showing-unallocated.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]\n\n\\[url=https://postimg.cc/47NzChrQ\\]\\[img\\]https://i.postimg.cc/47NzChrQ/Barracuda-device-settings-not-migrated.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]\n\nShould I disconnect them, uninstall the devices in settings, and try reconnecting them? If worst comes to worst, I *can* just format them again and copy the data.. but I'd really rather not spend an entire day again doing that when they show up fine externally! \n\n  \nThank you!",

After that i couldn't plug the charger after turning on the laptop or it wouldn't charge (it would only recognize the charger if it was shut down o if i turn it on with the charger plugged in). \n\nIt was like that for a few months and then it started shutting down again. i would need to unplug, wait a bit, turn it on, and after that it would work as it was working before. \n\nNow i can only use the laptop with the battery, most times i try to plugged it in, it will shut down (with the power and camera block key lights on). Sometime if i turn it on with the charger plugged in it will last an indeterminate amount of time and then shut down. \n\nAlso i tried using it without the battery, the light of the charger turn on, and immediately off again, and it won't turn on. \n\nI've taken it two places, the first guy said it could be the motherboard, and the second said it could be the battery but apparently the everything worked fine with the motherboard. \n\nI know an easy answer would be to buy a new battery, but it's not available in my country and i can't ship one from amazon (i assume because it's a battery)\n\nAny help is appreciated ",

Brief description.\n\nOS: Windows\n\nI was running Vivaldi and wanted to try Brave.\n\nBrave asked if I wanted to import Vivaldi's settings. I closed Vivaldi and agreed to this. The import was successful.\n\nThen I tried opening Vivaldi again but received several errors regarding the browser being unable to access its profile files (those imported by Brave).\n\n**I went to AppData/Local/Vivaldi (where these files are stored) and lo and behold, the \"Vivaldi\" folder is completely locked. I can't modify it in any way.**\n\nAlready did extensive research on Reddit and tried every single solution proposed: many command prompts including chkdsk (yes with elevated access), tried taking ownership through cmd and through the \"Security\" tab of the folder's properties, tried using software especialized in unlocking files during Windows restarts, everything fails because of \"Access denied\".\n\nI'm in the only Windows account of the PC, and obviously I have administrative access.\n\nThe only solution I didn't try is installing Linux to remove the files. I will do that eventually but if at all possible I'd like to solve this within Windows itself, and by this point I have a technical curiosity of how my own OS could lock me out of files.\n\nImportant details:\n\n1) The Vivaldi folders are all littered with files named \"LOCK\" without any content.\n\n2) I can actually modify these files in two ways: A) The Vivaldi uninstaller will move all these files into a parent subfolder named \"Default\", and the installer will reverse this operation and put them back at the root of the Vivaldi folder; B) my antivirus can quarantine the files and delete them from the quarantine (thus permanently removing them from the computer), but it can't do this to folders (because they are not files) and it can't do this to the \"LOCK\" files because they are \"empty\".",

Everything else works just fine, both of the USB headphones, other parts, checked all the onnections on motherboard and etc. \n\nThe speakers have the green power led when i connect their USB, and I checked them on my other PC, they work fine. Edifier gives no drivers for this models. \n\nThen I noticed that the High Definition Audio device just completely gone from my Device Manager, as well as any Realtek ones. I've got the latest drivers for Realtek audio from the motherboard web-page (ASRock B450M Pro4 Rev-2), installed succesfully and still nothing.\n\nTried to delete everything Realtek related with Revo Uninstaller, doesn't help.\n\nSo the speakers themselves work fine, checked on other PC. Other USB audio headphones (but they're USB-only) work fine. No driver installation helps.\n\nMaybe there's something corrupted within the audio drivers ot chipset drivers (AMD Platform). Maybe someone had a similar issue or some suggestions. I would be very glad to hear some advice, and thanks in advance!",

After hard resetting it on the “restarting” screen, it goes through the same loop again - updating to 7% followed by restarting and needing a hard reset after about 25 minutes. It’s gone through this cycle 3 times now, making me think it’s failing to install updates and then restarting to try again only to run into the same problem.

I've noticed that I have turned off all the \"run when booted\" option in all the app yet they still run right after I booted up my laptop and how all of those apps doesn't appear in Startup Apps of setting or in task manager. So i looked in Task Scheduler and there it was, suspiciously placed inside \"/CareCenter\"(I am using the Acer Nitro 5 so I don't know if this \"care center\" have any relation with that, I have tried another non-acer laptop and it don't have this folder) along with those task are a few suspiciously named tasks which also launch on boot, nothing else. These apps have no reason to be put into scheduled start on logging in so it is likely to be placed there as decoy to try and look less suspicious. Upon clicking on a task named \"Reader\\_Sl\\_Reg\\_HKLMWow6432Run\" to check its description the task automatically delete itself and become unavailable, so I use Event Viewer to check the log and somehow the Task Scheduler is conveniently disabled( I have never touched the Task Scheduler before so zero chance of me manually disabling it). From the suspicious name, decoy tasks, auto delete and disabled log this is most likely a virus yet I've tried Kaspersky Plus full scan which return nothing. Any idea to even locate this virus(Or maybe there were never any virus in the first place).",

Sometimes both left and right click don't work, and I resort to opening task manager to be able to acquire left click functionality.\n\nI assumed it would be an issue with the mouse, but turns out it works fine, wired and wireless (tested it on my Macbook).\n\nOften at times it would help switch from wireless to wired and it would work (I do this when I'm playing video games and it stops working mid game lol), but lately even switching to wired doesn't bring back right click.\n\nNo other wireless/bluetooth devices are on/enabled around my setup. Only my wired keyboard and audio interface are connected, and they've been connected the same duration as the mouse>\n\nI've tried resetting the firmware of mouse and the receiver, deleted the USB HID mouse from Device Manager, disabled animations on Windows explorer (which seemed to be the cause of the problem for some people). Also I am unable to click the taskbar randomly (as I am typing this post I can't lol)\n\nAny tips/suggestions would be appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Hey there , so yesterday I tried install Fedora in my secondary SSD which I had installed on my Lenovo IdeaPad pro 5i 14IAH10, and during that I noticed something windows was showing that I had installed windows on my primary SSD (which came with the laptop) but live environment for Ubuntu, Fedora and mint was showing i had it installed on my secondary SSD so I head back into windows to check whats up with that , after staring at windows Disk management and task manager i realised that I had windows installed on my secondary drive and actually named the primary as my secondary (when I reinstalled windows a few months ago , i accidentally chose the secondary SSD than my primary one , since both SSD had windows installed on them at some point both had a windows recovery partition) , after realising the mistake I made a few months ago i chose to proceed with installing Fedora on my primary SSD rather than my secondary which had the windows install according to Ubuntu, Fedora and mint live environment.\n\nI went ahead and tried to do a full drive installtion so I can manually choose which drive to boot from rather than using grub to whenever the device starts up. Well the Fedora installtion failed , and i went back into windows to see if the drive is still detecting the same but for some reason half of the drives capacity was missing and windows Disk management utility was not detecting the rest of the drive , so I went back to Fedora live environment and formatted the SSD and tried to install it again, it failed this time too (I made sure that I am formatting the primary SSD), since Fedora was not making any progress i started trying with Ubuntu 25 and it worked after a few trial and errors , i managed to install Ubuntu to my primary drive , but during the this trial and error stage when I went into the bios of my laptop I noticed that all the boot entries were gone, and i only had my pixe boot entry (i usually use it to test out netboot stuffs) and my live usb entry, windows boot manager was gone and same for my old Fedora grub boot entry.\n\nsince the windows boot manager entry was gone i thought well I can restore the uefi entry and get back into my old windows install, after booting into Ubuntu (after installation) , I checked my secondary SSD and it seems have the windows install on it (disk utilisation was there for my window install) , but for some reason i couldn't access it in anyway i tried, it was throwing some error mounting the disk, i tried to manually mount it and it also didn't work, so I ended up formatting the entire thing and decideing to reinstall windows on it again. And that's where I faced my next roadblock\n\nOn the attached pics , it's asking for drivers to detect the hardware (I have installed windows on this laptop before but it has never asked driver for it ,I'm not sure why is it asking now does the motherboard chip usually contain all the basic drivers ? , well that was what I used to think before this anyway)\n\nSo I went to lenovo's website and downloaded a few driver and threw them into a folder named Driver on my Ventoy drive and for some reason it is not detecting any of them even when I select the folder . I thought maybe Ventoy could be the issue and tried with a dedicated bootable pendrive flashed with windows 11 and it still shows the same thing. At this point I have tried mostly everything I know (excluding creating a bootable pendrive on windows using Rufus and trying that) . Now have anyone else faced this issue with the 2025 model of the IdeaPad pro 5i , if anyone knows how to get past this windows thing i would very much appreciate the help .",

    "selftext": "Hey all, hoping this subreddit is where I should go with this!\n\nI just put together a new PC build last week, and I got a Lian Li case with two HDD cages for internal older mechanical drives which I planned to use as archives/backups. From my old PC last week, I started doing the backups on there since I had to buy a new drive. \n\nI'm now running on a new **ASUS ProArt x870-E mobo**. I got an 8TB Seagate Barracuda drive, and was given 2 3TB Toshiba drives. One Toshiba was DOA, leading to the Barracuda. \n\nIn order for them to show up on my old HP Omen build while docked, I had to use diskpart cmd commands and format the disk that way, because it would show up as a 2TB drive (only in disk management, not explorer) but with the other 6TB as Unallocated Space. I got it recognized and formatted/mounted, then spent a day copying data for my archives over.\n\nWhen I put together the new build, I have these two drives into the bottom two data pins on the mobo, and they are showing up in Disk Management, but the same as before on the Omen, with the 2TB/Rest of the space unallocated. I checked the device/driver details, and it has the \"*Device settings for SCSI\\\\Disk&Ven\\_&Prod\\_ST8000DM004-2U91\\\\7&16843f94&0&020000 were not migrated from previous OS installation due to partial or ambiguous device match.\"* from when I first turned on the new build.\n\nI was just doing some switching on the fan headers to tidy things up and took the drives out, then docked them with my external drive dock to check the drives. Hooked up with that through USB, they read exactly as I'd left them on the Omen computer. But when I hooked them up directly to the mobo again, I'm back to the 2TB/Unallocated.\n\nI'll share screenshots here, sorry if I do this linking wrong. \n\n\\[url=https://postimg.cc/t7WcRKfW\\]\\[img\\]https://i.postimg.cc/t7WcRKfW/Barracuda-showing-Unallocated.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]\n\n\\[url=https://postimg.cc/vDfK8JjW\\]\\[img\\]https://i.postimg.cc/vDfK8JjW/Toshiba-showing-unallocated.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]\n\n\\[url=https://postimg.cc/47NzChrQ\\]\\[img\\]https://i.postimg.cc/47NzChrQ/Barracuda-device-settings-not-migrated.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]\n\nShould I disconnect them, uninstall the devices in settings, and try reconnecting them? If worst comes to worst, I *can* just format them again and copy the data.. but I'd really rather not spend an entire day again doing that when they show up fine externally! \n\n  \nThank you!",

Brief description.\n\nOS: Windows\n\nI was running Vivaldi and wanted to try Brave.\n\nBrave asked if I wanted to import Vivaldi's settings. I closed Vivaldi and agreed to this. The import was successful.\n\nThen I tried opening Vivaldi again but received several errors regarding the browser being unable to access its profile files (those imported by Brave).\n\n**I went to AppData/Local/Vivaldi (where these files are stored) and lo and behold, the \"Vivaldi\" folder is completely locked. I can't modify it in any way.**\n\nAlready did extensive research on Reddit and tried every single solution proposed: many command prompts including chkdsk (yes with elevated access), tried taking ownership through cmd and through the \"Security\" tab of the folder's properties, tried using software especialized in unlocking files during Windows restarts, everything fails because of \"Access denied\".\n\nI'm in the only Windows account of the PC, and obviously I have administrative access.\n\nThe only solution I didn't try is installing Linux to remove the files. I will do that eventually but if at all possible I'd like to solve this within Windows itself, and by this point I have a technical curiosity of how my own OS could lock me out of files.\n\nImportant details:\n\n1) The Vivaldi folders are all littered with files named \"LOCK\" without any content.\n\n2) I can actually modify these files in two ways: A) The Vivaldi uninstaller will move all these files into a parent subfolder named \"Default\", and the installer will reverse this operation and put them back at the root of the Vivaldi folder; B) my antivirus can quarantine the files and delete them from the quarantine (thus permanently removing them from the computer), but it can't do this to folders (because they are not files) and it can't do this to the \"LOCK\" files because they are \"empty\".",

Everything else works just fine, both of the USB headphones, other parts, checked all the onnections on motherboard and etc. \n\nThe speakers have the green power led when i connect their USB, and I checked them on my other PC, they work fine. Edifier gives no drivers for this models. \n\nThen I noticed that the High Definition Audio device just completely gone from my Device Manager, as well as any Realtek ones. I've got the latest drivers for Realtek audio from the motherboard web-page (ASRock B450M Pro4 Rev-2), installed succesfully and still nothing.\n\nTried to delete everything Realtek related with Revo Uninstaller, doesn't help.\n\nSo the speakers themselves work fine, checked on other PC. Other USB audio headphones (but they're USB-only) work fine. No driver installation helps.\n\nMaybe there's something corrupted within the audio drivers ot chipset drivers (AMD Platform). Maybe someone had a similar issue or some suggestions. I would be very glad to hear some advice, and thanks in advance!",

Yesterday I got a new microphone and I tested it in a call with a friend in a group chat, he said there was no echo, then later I got on a call with another friend in a server, asked him if he hears echo and he said he does, then I go back to the other friend and ask him if he hears it and now he also says he hears it.  \nI'm using headphones and an external microphone, so it can't be that the mic is picking up the sound.  \nAlso I'm not completely sure but this seems to only happen if there is another person from a laptop/PC in the call. For example if I'm in a call with a mobile user he doesn't hear echo, but if there's a laptop/PC user and a mobile user in the call, both of them hear echo.  \nI don't think it's from Discord itself because I tested it on messenger and there's also echo for a PC/laptop user.",

    "selftext": "Hey all, hoping this subreddit is where I should go with this!\n\nI just put together a new PC build last week, and I got a Lian Li case with two HDD cages for internal older mechanical drives which I planned to use as archives/backups. From my old PC last week, I started doing the backups on there since I had to buy a new drive. \n\nI'm now running on a new **ASUS ProArt x870-E mobo**. I got an 8TB Seagate Barracuda drive, and was given 2 3TB Toshiba drives. One Toshiba was DOA, leading to the Barracuda. \n\nIn order for them to show up on my old HP Omen build while docked, I had to use diskpart cmd commands and format the disk that way, because it would show up as a 2TB drive (only in disk management, not explorer) but with the other 6TB as Unallocated Space. I got it recognized and formatted/mounted, then spent a day copying data for my archives over.\n\nWhen I put together the new build, I have these two drives into the bottom two data pins on the mobo, and they are showing up in Disk Management, but the same as before on the Omen, with the 2TB/Rest of the space unallocated. I checked the device/driver details, and it has the \"*Device settings for SCSI\\\\Disk&Ven\\_&Prod\\_ST8000DM004-2U91\\\\7&16843f94&0&020000 were not migrated from previous OS installation due to partial or ambiguous device match.\"* from when I first turned on the new build.\n\nI was just doing some switching on the fan headers to tidy things up and took the drives out, then docked them with my external drive dock to check the drives. Hooked up with that through USB, they read exactly as I'd left them on the Omen computer. But when I hooked them up directly to the mobo again, I'm back to the 2TB/Unallocated.\n\nI'll share screenshots here, sorry if I do this linking wrong. \n\n\\[url=https://postimg.cc/t7WcRKfW\\]\\[img\\]https://i.postimg.cc/t7WcRKfW/Barracuda-showing-Unallocated.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]\n\n\\[url=https://postimg.cc/vDfK8JjW\\]\\[img\\]https://i.postimg.cc/vDfK8JjW/Toshiba-showing-unallocated.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]\n\n\\[url=https://postimg.cc/47NzChrQ\\]\\[img\\]https://i.postimg.cc/47NzChrQ/Barracuda-device-settings-not-migrated.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]\n\nShould I disconnect them, uninstall the devices in settings, and try reconnecting them? If worst comes to worst, I *can* just format them again and copy the data.. but I'd really rather not spend an entire day again doing that when they show up fine externally! \n\n  \nThank you!",
