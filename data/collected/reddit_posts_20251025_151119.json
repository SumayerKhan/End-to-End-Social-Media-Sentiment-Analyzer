But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for improvement when designing for repairability, especially where Apple’s complex engineering is concerned. So the big question remaining from this year's big M5 announcement is: did Apple upgrade the MacBook Pro’s repairability?",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "selftext": "I know this might be a dumb question, but why didn't the lightning port ever improve in data transfers or charging capability? \n\nGranted this is anecdotal, but I thought the lightning port was superior from a physical perspective. I've  had USB-C loosen over time and have seen them get destroyed by there hollow design but the lightning port was a plug that you didn't have to worry about as much and was easier to clean. Why at least not make it a little bigger on a redesign or something to compete? I like USB-C, but I was always curious why Apple never continued to innovate a good port and cash cow.",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’d like to share the app I’ve been working on over the past few months - **Dory**.\n\nI think the video does a much better job of explaining what it’s all about, so feel free to check it out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z\\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAj3frI3Z_Q)\n\n**Dory is an app switcher that lets you quickly cycle through apps without moving your hand from the mouse, keyboard or trackpad - and without needing to remember any shortcuts.**\n\nClick a mouse button - or a modifier key if both hands are on the keyboard - and type the first letter of the app’s name.\n\nFind apps using the first letter, middle letters, acronyms, or similar names.\n\nIf multiple apps share that letter, just keep tapping it to cycle through them.\n\nYou can also press the middle mouse button and start typing the app’s name directly.\n\nPrefer tapping over holding? No problem. With Press Mode, you can open Dory’s sleek UI using a global shortcut or a **trackpad gesture!** (new)\n\nDory works right out of the box - and over time, it learns which apps you use most and prioritizes them.\n\nNo extra shortcuts.\n\nNo setup. Nothing to remember.\n\n\\--\n\nIt's currently $4.99 on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dory-app-switcher/id6746273626?mt=12) (**One-time purchase**. **No subscription.**) for a limited time.",

Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks.\n\nThis paper presents a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties.",

First of all, there is a war, a huge one ongoing for more than 1 year, 2 and 3, we could deep dive up to 2014.\n\nAnd Apple still allows our applications to be moderated (approved) by russian people that simply hate us and kill us every day.\n\nExample situation: a team creates an iOS app, sends it for approval, and here we go - a call from a California number +1. And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for improvement when designing for repairability, especially where Apple’s complex engineering is concerned. So the big question remaining from this year's big M5 announcement is: did Apple upgrade the MacBook Pro’s repairability?",

This was supposed to be my primary nighttime photography camera, because my actual camera also doesn’t do low light but I don’t think this is going to work. ",

    "selftext": "I have a 14 Pro with 128GB\n\nI bought it on release date and have kept it in perfect conditions until now.\n\nDue to the degraded battery life (74%) I frequently have to charge it. It also seems to get a little sluggish sometimes, with some apps taking too long to open or lagging. I also have just 15GB left of local phone storage, and I can't really open more space, as many of the apps I don't use are already offloaded.\n\nI have been using iphones for around 8 years (since iPhone 8 Plus) and I'm quite used to the ecosystem: I also own Airpods Pro 3, Apple Watch 9 and iCloud+ ( have over 250GB of data there).\n\nI was considering upgrading my phone to a newer model (with bigger storage), and one of the newest iPhones was obviously the first option, but I'm honestly somehow disappointed with the lack of innovation from Apple, as it feels like all the phones are the same since iPhone 12.\n\nI have started looking into other brands and options like the new Samsung Z Fold 7 or Flip 7 seem interesting, as they bring a lot of innovation into their form factor and features. Also, the fact that they are highly integrated with Gemini is a huge plus when compared to Apple's lacking AI features.\n\nAt the same time, making the switch to something like Samsung mostly means I would  probably have to switch my whole ecosystem (watch, earbuds, cloud storage...), which would be expensive and take a lot of work, so I'm not sure if I'm up for it.\n\nI have also considered just getting a battery replacement at Apple and trying to endure another year, until hopefully apple comes up with something new for iPhone 18, but I'm not sure my remaining storage will be enough till then.\n\nWas anybody else in the same situation? What did you do?\n\n  \nTL;DR: Stay with Apple or Jump out?",

I’ve been an android user for 12 years until now, because Google started to spy on Android users 24/7 to train their Gemini plagiarism machine, and my friends who work at the Apple Store and one who works in digital security said iPhone, while not perfect either, is better than android in that way.\n\nI’m a few weeks in with the air, and I like it a lot! It’s very pretty, probably the prettiest phone I’ve owned, and I regularly get comments about how the colour is nice, how thin it is, how nice it is from my friends. It feels nice in my hands (I have v large hands for anyone concerned about their particular ergonomics), and I have never noticed it feeling “underpowered.) While I would like more cameras or a better speaker setup on the next Air, I don’t really have any major issue with them as they are, definitely not enough to return it.\n\nI know my perspective is unique and nobody asked for it, but I see a lot of these posts about people returning it and just wanted to say that some of us who got them are quite happy with theirs!",

    "selftext": "Just wanted to give a warning to others in the Dublin area. I got scammed a couple of days ago buying an iPhone 15 pro max for the heafty sum of €550, around the Clare Hall/ Belmayne area.\n\nWas advertised on Facebook (account from 2021) and seemed a fairly normal interaction. Arranged to meet and the guy kept saying how he was on his lunch and his boss was going to be on his back if he was late returning so it was all very rushed. Quickly checked a few things and it looked fine. But literally 2 minutes after he left I got a better look through the phone and realised something wasn’t right. Then of course my attempts to contact the guy were ignored. The more I think about it, there were a few other little things that were red flags but I just missed them in the moment.\n\nFeel like an absolute idiot. Was trying to get myself a phone upgrade and got absolutely shafted. Have always bought phones used, and have never had a problem but this is an expensive lesson learned.\n\nAnyway long story short, beware if you are buying a phone in Dublin, there are very believable fakes doing the rounds.\n\nOne thing I also only thought of afterwards was that asking to see an ID for a purchase of this value is hardly going to be an unreasonable request for anyone that’s actually genuine. So in the future I think that’s what I’ll do, if I ever build up the courage to buy something from Facebook marketplace again! 😅😂🫠\n\nI might try put up a few of the more obvious identifiers here if people are interested because I actually did try to search online for how to identify fake iPhones I didn’t really get anything overly useful.\n\nOne very obvious one was Apple Maps - it opens Google maps. There’s tons of others - can go through and post some of them up if anyone is interested?\n\nAs a side note, I thought of selling it to recoup some of my money, perhaps for \\~150€ or whatever someone would pay for it. I thought perhaps someone might buy it for their child or maybe someone might want it as it looks the part but is cheap. However, my partner made a very valid point that maybe some other scammer will buy it and then try the scam again on some other unsuspecting person! So that has left me thinking that I need to keep it as a paper weight or deystroy it! 😥",

    "selftext": "I’ve read for optical reasons, it’s easier to make a wide angle lens with a short minimum focusing distance, but even the 24mm equiv. Main camera can focus as near as about 6”.\n\nWhen the camera app switches to the 13mm equiv. (ultra wide) lens camera [for macro photos], it also has to crop the image a lot. In even moderately low light requiring a higher ISO, the main camera produces better image quality cropped in than the ultra wide lens.\n\nAs for other applications you’d want a wide angle lens, like group photos, the distortion anywhere near the sides of the image make people look too weird. For landscapes, panorama mode is more useful.\n\nMy point is, ultra wide on a phone camera is super niche. We’d be better off with 24mm, 50mm, and 100mm equiv. lenses.\n\nEdit: bracketed text in second paragraph for clarity",

It’s like trying to curve a spinning ball in Pokemon Go all over again lol\n\nI’ve googled and tried the accessibility touch feature, but that only adds a Home button, doesn’t let me open the carousel. \n\nIs there any known shortcut to do this easily with a button press, like how it was done on older models?

I’m the type of person who never uses the camera, much less edit photos and stuff like that, so it actually feels good to let go something you’re dragging around all the time and never use. I do watch a lot of YouTube, I’ve dropped the phone on my face so many times, so it was just the Air mono speaker what was holding me back.\n\nDecided to pull the trigger and I instantly noticed how much I actually care about lightness and portability. This thing feels like “you’re just holding the screen”, if that makes sense, and I don’t think I can go back to a brick anymore. The speaker is ok to rot in bed watching reels and short content, but I’ll say this: forget about landscape mode. It’s a bit unbearable, so I’ve been using my AirPods much more. I do miss the Pro speakers, but I don’t feel that compelled to return it for the Pro…\n\nFor people that made a similar change, what’s your experience so far? What are your thoughts on the mono speaker?",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

I’ve been an android user for 12 years until now, because Google started to spy on Android users 24/7 to train their Gemini plagiarism machine, and my friends who work at the Apple Store and one who works in digital security said iPhone, while not perfect either, is better than android in that way.\n\nI’m a few weeks in with the air, and I like it a lot! It’s very pretty, probably the prettiest phone I’ve owned, and I regularly get comments about how the colour is nice, how thin it is, how nice it is from my friends. It feels nice in my hands (I have v large hands for anyone concerned about their particular ergonomics), and I have never noticed it feeling “underpowered.) While I would like more cameras or a better speaker setup on the next Air, I don’t really have any major issue with them as they are, definitely not enough to return it.\n\nI know my perspective is unique and nobody asked for it, but I see a lot of these posts about people returning it and just wanted to say that some of us who got them are quite happy with theirs!",

I’m the type of person who never uses the camera, much less edit photos and stuff like that, so it actually feels good to let go something you’re dragging around all the time and never use. I do watch a lot of YouTube, I’ve dropped the phone on my face so many times, so it was just the Air mono speaker what was holding me back.\n\nDecided to pull the trigger and I instantly noticed how much I actually care about lightness and portability. This thing feels like “you’re just holding the screen”, if that makes sense, and I don’t think I can go back to a brick anymore. The speaker is ok to rot in bed watching reels and short content, but I’ll say this: forget about landscape mode. It’s a bit unbearable, so I’ve been using my AirPods much more. I do miss the Pro speakers, but I don’t feel that compelled to return it for the Pro…\n\nFor people that made a similar change, what’s your experience so far? What are your thoughts on the mono speaker?",

    "selftext": "Just switched from a Pixel 9 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro and honestly, it’s been rough. I’m living in a country where I don’t speak the language, and the translation stuff on iPhone just isn’t great.(Most apps and the web decided that i speak the language since i live here and i guess I can’t do anything about it)\n\nOn my Pixel I could just tap or hold on anything and instantly translate it — super easy and smooth. On the iPhone it feels like I have to go through a bunch of steps or open separate apps. I even made a shortcut so that double tapping the back of the phone translates what’s on the screen, but it’s super buggy and only works half the time.\n\nAnyone else run into this or found a good workaround?\n",

It also seems to get a little sluggish sometimes, with some apps taking too long to open or lagging. I also have just 15GB left of local phone storage, and I can't really open more space, as many of the apps I don't use are already offloaded.\n\nI have been using iphones for around 8 years (since iPhone 8 Plus) and I'm quite used to the ecosystem: I also own Airpods Pro 3, Apple Watch 9 and iCloud+ ( have over 250GB of data there).\n\nI was considering upgrading my phone to a newer model (with bigger storage), and one of the newest iPhones was obviously the first option, but I'm honestly somehow disappointed with the lack of innovation from Apple, as it feels like all the phones are the same since iPhone 12.\n\nI have started looking into other brands and options like the new Samsung Z Fold 7 or Flip 7 seem interesting, as they bring a lot of innovation into their form factor and features. Also, the fact that they are highly integrated with Gemini is a huge plus when compared to Apple's lacking AI features.\n\nAt the same time, making the switch to something like Samsung mostly means I would  probably have to switch my whole ecosystem (watch, earbuds, cloud storage...), which would be expensive and take a lot of work, so I'm not sure if I'm up for it.\n\nI have also considered just getting a battery replacement at Apple and trying to endure another year, until hopefully apple comes up with something new for iPhone 18, but I'm not sure my remaining storage will be enough till then.\n\nWas anybody else in the same situation? What did you do?\n\n  \nTL;DR: Stay with Apple or Jump out?",

I’ve been an android user for 12 years until now, because Google started to spy on Android users 24/7 to train their Gemini plagiarism machine, and my friends who work at the Apple Store and one who works in digital security said iPhone, while not perfect either, is better than android in that way.\n\nI’m a few weeks in with the air, and I like it a lot! It’s very pretty, probably the prettiest phone I’ve owned, and I regularly get comments about how the colour is nice, how thin it is, how nice it is from my friends. It feels nice in my hands (I have v large hands for anyone concerned about their particular ergonomics), and I have never noticed it feeling “underpowered.) While I would like more cameras or a better speaker setup on the next Air, I don’t really have any major issue with them as they are, definitely not enough to return it.\n\nI know my perspective is unique and nobody asked for it, but I see a lot of these posts about people returning it and just wanted to say that some of us who got them are quite happy with theirs!",

I’m the type of person who never uses the camera, much less edit photos and stuff like that, so it actually feels good to let go something you’re dragging around all the time and never use. I do watch a lot of YouTube, I’ve dropped the phone on my face so many times, so it was just the Air mono speaker what was holding me back.\n\nDecided to pull the trigger and I instantly noticed how much I actually care about lightness and portability. This thing feels like “you’re just holding the screen”, if that makes sense, and I don’t think I can go back to a brick anymore. The speaker is ok to rot in bed watching reels and short content, but I’ll say this: forget about landscape mode. It’s a bit unbearable, so I’ve been using my AirPods much more. I do miss the Pro speakers, but I don’t feel that compelled to return it for the Pro…\n\nFor people that made a similar change, what’s your experience so far? What are your thoughts on the mono speaker?",

    "selftext": "I have a 14 Pro with 128GB\n\nI bought it on release date and have kept it in perfect conditions until now.\n\nDue to the degraded battery life (74%) I frequently have to charge it. It also seems to get a little sluggish sometimes, with some apps taking too long to open or lagging. I also have just 15GB left of local phone storage, and I can't really open more space, as many of the apps I don't use are already offloaded.\n\nI have been using iphones for around 8 years (since iPhone 8 Plus) and I'm quite used to the ecosystem: I also own Airpods Pro 3, Apple Watch 9 and iCloud+ ( have over 250GB of data there).\n\nI was considering upgrading my phone to a newer model (with bigger storage), and one of the newest iPhones was obviously the first option, but I'm honestly somehow disappointed with the lack of innovation from Apple, as it feels like all the phones are the same since iPhone 12.\n\nI have started looking into other brands and options like the new Samsung Z Fold 7 or Flip 7 seem interesting, as they bring a lot of innovation into their form factor and features. Also, the fact that they are highly integrated with Gemini is a huge plus when compared to Apple's lacking AI features.\n\nAt the same time, making the switch to something like Samsung mostly means I would  probably have to switch my whole ecosystem (watch, earbuds, cloud storage...), which would be expensive and take a lot of work, so I'm not sure if I'm up for it.\n\nI have also considered just getting a battery replacement at Apple and trying to endure another year, until hopefully apple comes up with something new for iPhone 18, but I'm not sure my remaining storage will be enough till then.\n\nWas anybody else in the same situation? What did you do?\n\n  \nTL;DR: Stay with Apple or Jump out?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’m an indie Android developer, and over the past few months I’ve been working on something that brings back the old-school radio experience — but built for the modern Android ecosystem.\n\nThe app lets users:  \n📻 Listen to **50,000+ live radio stations** from around the world (music, news, talk, podcasts).  \n🌎 **Browse by Country, Genre, or Language** — for example, K-Pop from Korea or classic rock from the US.  \n🔎 **Global Search** — find any station by keyword, location, or genre.  \n❤️ **Favorite stations** to build your personal list.  \n😴 **Sleep Timer & Auto Start** — one of my favorite features for night listening.\n\nMy focus was on keeping it lightweight, responsive, and aligned with Android design principles — no clutter, just pure listening.\n\nI’d love to hear from **Android enthusiasts** about what makes a radio or music app *feel native* and enjoyable on Android.\n\n* Do you prefer Material-You dynamic theming?\n* Would background playback controls via notification or lock screen make a difference?\n* Any UI or UX preferences that make you stay longer in such apps?\n\n👉 For those curious, it’s available on the Play Store here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio)\n\nHappy to take feedback, discuss architecture, and chat about how I implemented global streaming efficiently for Android.\n\nThanks for reading — your suggestions can genuinely help me polish this for future updates 🙏",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR. The glasses are likely to habe a 2,5 - 3k display per eye and the tracking is done by a on-device processor. (Ik Apple won't have Android XR of course). I would LOVE if google would implement Android XR in Android. I dont mind my phone getting hot but I wouldn't have to sync my photos and all of that.",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n \n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n \n\nThis wasn't isolated—there are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n \n\n1.           Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n \n\n2.           Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no             CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no             CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode—no account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no             START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n \n\n3.           Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog—emergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no             START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no             onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no             Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n \n\n4.           UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n \n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed—the design is the vulnerability.\n\n \n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n•             \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n•             AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n•             AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n•             Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n•             Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n \n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n \n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n \n\n•             Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n•             Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n•             Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n•             Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n•             I never requested email creation\n\n•             \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n•             Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n•             Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n•             This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n \n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n•             Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n•             AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n•             No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n•             Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n•             June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n•             August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n•             September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n•             October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n•             August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n \n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n•             Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n•             Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n•             Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n \n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n•             Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n•             Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n•             Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n \n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n•             Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n•             Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n•             Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n \n\nActions Taken:\n\n•             Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n•             Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n•             Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.           Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.           Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.           Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.           Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted). Evidence is published in the public interest to protect other users and establish appropriate boundaries for AI autonomous action. \\*DO NOT: attempt to recreate in an uncontrolled environment, this could result in a real emergency call\\*\n\nCross-AI validation by Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) provides independent verification of technical claims and threat assessment.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*Verification:\\*\\*\n\nEvery file cryptographically hashed with SHA-256.\n\n \n\n\\*\\*SHA-256 ZIP Hash:\\*\\*\n\n482e158efcd3c2594548692a1c0e6e29c2a3d53b492b2e7797f8147d4ac7bea2\n\n \n\nVerify after download: \\`certutil -hashfile Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip SHA256\\`\n\n\\*\\*All personally identifiable information (PII) has been redacted.\\*\\*\n\n \n\nURL with full in depth evidence details, with debug data proving these events can be found at;\n\n \n\nPublic archive:\\*\\* \\[archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510\\](https://archive.org/details/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510)\n\n \n\nDirect download:\\*\\* \\[Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip\\](https://archive.org/download/gemini-911-evidence-final\\_202510/Gemini\\_911\\_Evidence\\_FINAL.zip) (5.76 MB)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’m an indie Android developer, and over the past few months I’ve been working on something that brings back the old-school radio experience — but built for the modern Android ecosystem.\n\nThe app lets users:  \n📻 Listen to **50,000+ live radio stations** from around the world (music, news, talk, podcasts).  \n🌎 **Browse by Country, Genre, or Language** — for example, K-Pop from Korea or classic rock from the US.  \n🔎 **Global Search** — find any station by keyword, location, or genre.  \n❤️ **Favorite stations** to build your personal list.  \n😴 **Sleep Timer & Auto Start** — one of my favorite features for night listening.\n\nMy focus was on keeping it lightweight, responsive, and aligned with Android design principles — no clutter, just pure listening.\n\nI’d love to hear from **Android enthusiasts** about what makes a radio or music app *feel native* and enjoyable on Android.\n\n* Do you prefer Material-You dynamic theming?\n* Would background playback controls via notification or lock screen make a difference?\n* Any UI or UX preferences that make you stay longer in such apps?\n\n👉 For those curious, it’s available on the Play Store here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newradio.fmradio.radio.radiotuner.radiostation.freeradio)\n\nHappy to take feedback, discuss architecture, and chat about how I implemented global streaming efficiently for Android.\n\nThanks for reading — your suggestions can genuinely help me polish this for future updates 🙏",

After over 100 days of waiting, following up, and sending every bit of proof they asked for, I finally received a response — and it’s nothing short of insulting.\n\nThey claim my Pixel 6a is “not eligible” for the battery performance program and that their decision “stands firm.”\nTheir reasoning? Because my phone received the OTA update, they believe it’s safe to use.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear: my Pixel 6a’s battery is swollen.\nThe back panel is literally lifting, and the phone looks like it could burst at any moment.\nYet Google Support — a trillion-dollar company — tells me it’s “safe” simply because of a software patch.\n\nThis isn’t just negligence. It feels like a deliberate attempt to gaslight affected customers.\n\nEven worse, Google’s own appeasement program page says the appeasement app disables affected phones after identifying the fault — since they’re unsafe to use.\nBut the support agent told me the exact opposite: that my phone is not affected because it got the OTA that supposedly “makes it safe.”\n\nSo which is it? Because right now, it feels like a scam tactic to deny legitimate claims while pretending the problem doesn’t exist.\n\nMy battery life has been destroyed since that update — it barely lasts an hour now, runs hot, and is clearly unstable.\nIf this is what Google calls safe, they’ve lost touch with reality and consumer safety.\n\nThis isn’t just a complaint — it’s a warning to other Pixel users.\nDon’t let them silence you with scripted replies and fake “OTA fixes.”\nMy case proves they are ignoring real safety hazards and denying rightful appeasements with deceptive reasoning.\n\nGoogle, you’ve had 100+ days to do the right thing.\nInstead, you chose to insult your customers’ intelligence and risk their safety.",

And I can't even speak about the pleasure of using the Pixel keyboard compared to the iPhone one, just different tiers. I feel that the Pixel is smoother, maybe due to the absence of the horrid Liquid Glass animations; I feel the transaction between different apps more seamless. \n\nHowever there is a single instance in which the iPhone, for my taste, is incredibly superior (except for battery and integration across devices): the quality of the display. The colours of the iPhone are brighter and gorgeous, and at the same level of brightness setting, the Pixel has a darker display, with way less brilliant colours.\n\nDo you feel the same? ",

I'm a fairly new Pixel user (had a 7 Pro for about 6 months before getting the 10 Pro) and I can't seem to find the answer to this.    \nWhy can I not use the volume buttons to take a picture in Google Lens? I've been searching for an answer for a few hours and I keep landing on \"change the settings for the main camera app, if this doesn't work, uninstall and reinstall Camera App updates\". This has not worked and I can't figure out why it works in the camera app but not Google lens.    \nFor clarity, I am pressing the camera icon in the Google search bar at the bottom of the home screen as I use this multiple times a day. It's a minor gripe but I'm often using my phone one-handed and having to juggle my grip to press the shutter button on-screen is a kerfuffle.    \n    \nAm I being an idiot and missing a simple solution or do I need to download something third-party to circumvent this?    \n    \nI appreciate any feedback and I've now joined this sub because I've already found some useful tips I didn't know I needed! (Also, this phone is probably the best phone I've ever owned. Absolutely love it.) Thanks again!",

Since it is already almost 2 months the warranty expired, this is not covered\" - The tone was not even consoling...haha....it was pitiful....I am a fairly average user with most of my usage being entertainment and browsing....this came as a shock to me!!\n\nI feel appalled because unlike our US counterparts, Indians have to shell out a major portion of their monthly salary to buy these flagship phones. Imagine earning 2Lacs a month and paying 1.25 Lacs for the device which promised 7 years of OS updates when ironically it is not even able to guarantee 14 months of lifespan.....IMHO this is pure deception and scam being inflicted on the people. I know this is not unlike other companies but hey at least OnePlus has owned its defects and came back with friendlier policies and even expanded it to India. It has ensured to expand its official service centres with very good staff across every major cities in the country unlike Google which has not bothered yet to work on after sales.\n\nThis was a lesson for me on a variety of topics in this life - from consumerism to capitalism, from self reflection to self destruction - we should not fall to marketing gimmicks and shenanigans these BigTech employ to make you feel like you are missing something if you dont have their products. I have learned a valuable lesson that **Don't buy a product which has close to negligible after sales service and negligible empathy for customers**. While Google does have a great software team, its hardware offerings are meh! I feel I cheated on my OP7T which still work like butter even now! Sorry OP!!!!!! \\_/\\\\\\_   \nI held back on buying a flagship phone for almost 10 years and now I think I should never have. :(\n\nI should have never expected in the first place that a company with such a poor and pathetic track record with hardware can create magical experience with mobile phones. After all phones are not just their looks. What matters the most is whether they can walk significantly with you in your life and whether the manufacturer actually has this intention. I am pretty sure Google doesn't especially not in countries like India.",

The removal of the rear finger print sensor kept me from the 4 & the design of the rear camera bezel kept me from 6-8. Plus I think many of us agree that 5 was peak. I didn't know that until I made the change.\n\nI had hoped that the 9 would grow on me, but I continue to hate its bulkiness.

    "selftext": "Google Case no.: 4-1941000040097  &  4-4312000039720\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m extremely disappointed with how Google Support has handled my Pixel 7 battery swelling issue. My phone’s battery expanded, pushing up the screen — a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner **CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore)**, but not other parts. This is unreasonable, as previous similar cases were covered entirely under warranty or goodwill.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google’s authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they **refused to replace just the battery** and **insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen**, the LCD cost about **SGD 200++**— even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright **scam or cost-shifting tactic** — forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a **known manufacturing defect**. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI’m without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day, \n\n1. I made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare)\n2. Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery.\n3. Still without a functioning phone after 5 days+\n\nService Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you? \n\nIf you’re facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it’ll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect.",

They told me that they couldn't give me updates because Google generated the shipping. I don't have access to the Google collect account number.  I contacted Google and they told me I should talk to FedEx.\n4. After 3 weeks, I was able to get on the phone with someone from FedEx after Google gave me the shipping destination.  They declared the device lost/ stolen.\n5. After two more weeks, Google has yet to do anything.  I have contacted them multiple times, and they just keep telling me a \"specialist\" is working on my case and they can't escalate it any further.\n\nIt has been over a month.  What recourse do I have?  What steps should I take?  I have screenshots of conversations, email threads, and even recordings of phone calls.",

Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

I narrated as though I was discussing the Fall foliage with my dog, very silly and random.\n\nTonight I was playing them back. Suddenly, in one video, the audio changed from my voice to wild animals or maybe werewolves roaring and attacking, with loud clanking of chains, and the panicky cries of some ululating birds in the distance. (No such animals where I live. Nor werewolves.) It was like a horror film. \n\nI'm perplexed. I have never even edited a video, but I guess I accidentally edited these sounds in? But how could I do that accidentally? \n\nI wish I could have the original audio of my own voice back, because I was chatting and interacting with my dog, and she's near the end of her life -- I wanted a nice memory of us together.\n\nAny theories re. how I added these weird noises, and/or how I can get rid of them, would be welcome. \n\nEDIT: I saw that I accidentally switched the taping speed to slow motion -- that changed the audio a lot. And someone mentioned maybe adding audio emojis unintentionally; trying to figure out if I did that (I had never used such things). Last night I would have sworn these sounds were real animals, today...I think maybe not.\n\nI know I sound like a crazy person and I don't blame anybody for thinking I'm making this up, lol. My dog is 14 and has cancer and I wanted a video of us together, in the park that she loves. So getting a video to share means editing out parts where I'm crying, finding a piece where I'm speaking normally, and also getting a piece where the weird sounds happen. I have never edited a video and I'm so afraid of losing the whole thing. \n\nI just want to thank anyone who took the time to respond, and I'm sorry I couldn't work out sharing the video -- but with the help of YouTube and Google, I *may* manage it yet. If so, I will post it here even though it might take a week and no one will see it! \n\n",

    "selftext": "I am absolutely stunned and disgusted by how Google Support has handled my Pixel 6a case. After over 100 days of waiting, following up, and sending every bit of proof they asked for, I finally received a response — and it’s nothing short of insulting.\n\nThey claim my Pixel 6a is “not eligible” for the battery performance program and that their decision “stands firm.”\nTheir reasoning? Because my phone received the OTA update, they believe it’s safe to use.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear: my Pixel 6a’s battery is swollen.\nThe back panel is literally lifting, and the phone looks like it could burst at any moment.\nYet Google Support — a trillion-dollar company — tells me it’s “safe” simply because of a software patch.\n\nThis isn’t just negligence. It feels like a deliberate attempt to gaslight affected customers.\n\nEven worse, Google’s own appeasement program page says the appeasement app disables affected phones after identifying the fault — since they’re unsafe to use.\nBut the support agent told me the exact opposite: that my phone is not affected because it got the OTA that supposedly “makes it safe.”\n\nSo which is it? Because right now, it feels like a scam tactic to deny legitimate claims while pretending the problem doesn’t exist.\n\nMy battery life has been destroyed since that update — it barely lasts an hour now, runs hot, and is clearly unstable.\nIf this is what Google calls safe, they’ve lost touch with reality and consumer safety.\n\nThis isn’t just a complaint — it’s a warning to other Pixel users.\nDon’t let them silence you with scripted replies and fake “OTA fixes.”\nMy case proves they are ignoring real safety hazards and denying rightful appeasements with deceptive reasoning.\n\nGoogle, you’ve had 100+ days to do the right thing.\nInstead, you chose to insult your customers’ intelligence and risk their safety.",

And I can't even speak about the pleasure of using the Pixel keyboard compared to the iPhone one, just different tiers. I feel that the Pixel is smoother, maybe due to the absence of the horrid Liquid Glass animations; I feel the transaction between different apps more seamless. \n\nHowever there is a single instance in which the iPhone, for my taste, is incredibly superior (except for battery and integration across devices): the quality of the display. The colours of the iPhone are brighter and gorgeous, and at the same level of brightness setting, the Pixel has a darker display, with way less brilliant colours.\n\nDo you feel the same? ",

I've been used to using the dictation tool a lot with all my pixels, but since I switched to Pixel 8a I am stopping using it for this very annoying feature: before each comma, and I use commas a lot, the dictation tool thinks it makes sense to add a space. Something like:\n\n\"Hello , fellow redditos\"\n\ninstead of\n\n\"Hello, fellow redditors\".\n\nIs there a way to prevent this from happening? I also tried to implement a personal rule in the dictionary, but probably it doesn't work with punctuation marks. ",

    "selftext": "Up until this Wednesday evening, I was almost happy with my phone - some hiccups though over the span of 12 months - blank screen, sudden hang ups, brightness issues, overheating when using video etc. Despite all these bugs, this was the best android phone I had ever used - sleek, stylish, smooth and snappy.....buggy though..... - but tough love!! <3 \n\nJust after making a call, I pressed the power button. Little did I know this would be the last time I would have used the device. It died! No matter how many CPRs ([Google Pixel 9 Pro (XL) Black Screen Of Death? (SOLVED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRwlpGb1gqk)) I would try!!! Then came the awakening. I visited the so called Google Exclusive Service Center in Bengaluru where I had to pay 850INR for inspection and on request they said the diagnosis would be done on priority. After 30 minutes, I went back and I was told the bad news which I expected anyways - \"The motherboard has died. You would need to pay 43000 INR for its replacement. Since it is already almost 2 months the warranty expired, this is not covered\" - The tone was not even consoling...haha....it was pitiful....I am a fairly average user with most of my usage being entertainment and browsing....this came as a shock to me!!\n\nI feel appalled because unlike our US counterparts, Indians have to shell out a major portion of their monthly salary to buy these flagship phones. Imagine earning 2Lacs a month and paying 1.25 Lacs for the device which promised 7 years of OS updates when ironically it is not even able to guarantee 14 months of lifespan.....IMHO this is pure deception and scam being inflicted on the people. I know this is not unlike other companies but hey at least OnePlus has owned its defects and came back with friendlier policies and even expanded it to India. It has ensured to expand its official service centres with very good staff across every major cities in the country unlike Google which has not bothered yet to work on after sales.\n\nThis was a lesson for me on a variety of topics in this life - from consumerism to capitalism, from self reflection to self destruction - we should not fall to marketing gimmicks and shenanigans these BigTech employ to make you feel like you are missing something if you dont have their products. I have learned a valuable lesson that **Don't buy a product which has close to negligible after sales service and negligible empathy for customers**. While Google does have a great software team, its hardware offerings are meh! I feel I cheated on my OP7T which still work like butter even now! Sorry OP!!!!!! \\_/\\\\\\_   \nI held back on buying a flagship phone for almost 10 years and now I think I should never have. :(\n\nI should have never expected in the first place that a company with such a poor and pathetic track record with hardware can create magical experience with mobile phones. After all phones are not just their looks. What matters the most is whether they can walk significantly with you in your life and whether the manufacturer actually has this intention. I am pretty sure Google doesn't especially not in countries like India.",

I'm a fairly new Pixel user (had a 7 Pro for about 6 months before getting the 10 Pro) and I can't seem to find the answer to this.    \nWhy can I not use the volume buttons to take a picture in Google Lens? I've been searching for an answer for a few hours and I keep landing on \"change the settings for the main camera app, if this doesn't work, uninstall and reinstall Camera App updates\". This has not worked and I can't figure out why it works in the camera app but not Google lens.    \nFor clarity, I am pressing the camera icon in the Google search bar at the bottom of the home screen as I use this multiple times a day. It's a minor gripe but I'm often using my phone one-handed and having to juggle my grip to press the shutter button on-screen is a kerfuffle.    \n    \nAm I being an idiot and missing a simple solution or do I need to download something third-party to circumvent this?    \n    \nI appreciate any feedback and I've now joined this sub because I've already found some useful tips I didn't know I needed! (Also, this phone is probably the best phone I've ever owned. Absolutely love it.) Thanks again!",

    "title": "How to recover my data from Pixel 7",
    "selftext": "Earlier this year I repaired my pixel 7 due to the “Black Screen of Death”. Basically this is a motherboard issue and you have to either repair  the IC in it or change the whole motherboard. Most probably the repair guy repaired the IC in my device’s motherboard. So, just after 6-7 weeks from that repair my device’s OS became very buggy. At first, 1 or 2 apps used to crash for like a week or two. That means whenever I tried to open that app, it used to crash immediately and that app was inaccessible for a week long. After a period of time it used to go back to normal but another new app would have started to face the same issue. By time the issue got worse and number of apps crashing increased to a point where only a handful of apps was accessible. So, right now the whole phone is completely inaccessible and is stuck in the booting screen just as the attached image. The phone doesn’t go past this loading screen. Factory resetting might help in this case but I have a lot of important photos and videos in this device. Those are some of the most valuable memories of my life with my family and friends. I just don’t wanna lose them. Thats why I’m seeking help that if there are any ways I can recover my data or repair the phone without losing the data. THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

After over 100 days of waiting, following up, and sending every bit of proof they asked for, I finally received a response — and it’s nothing short of insulting.\n\nThey claim my Pixel 6a is “not eligible” for the battery performance program and that their decision “stands firm.”\nTheir reasoning? Because my phone received the OTA update, they believe it’s safe to use.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear: my Pixel 6a’s battery is swollen.\nThe back panel is literally lifting, and the phone looks like it could burst at any moment.\nYet Google Support — a trillion-dollar company — tells me it’s “safe” simply because of a software patch.\n\nThis isn’t just negligence. It feels like a deliberate attempt to gaslight affected customers.\n\nEven worse, Google’s own appeasement program page says the appeasement app disables affected phones after identifying the fault — since they’re unsafe to use.\nBut the support agent told me the exact opposite: that my phone is not affected because it got the OTA that supposedly “makes it safe.”\n\nSo which is it? Because right now, it feels like a scam tactic to deny legitimate claims while pretending the problem doesn’t exist.\n\nMy battery life has been destroyed since that update — it barely lasts an hour now, runs hot, and is clearly unstable.\nIf this is what Google calls safe, they’ve lost touch with reality and consumer safety.\n\nThis isn’t just a complaint — it’s a warning to other Pixel users.\nDon’t let them silence you with scripted replies and fake “OTA fixes.”\nMy case proves they are ignoring real safety hazards and denying rightful appeasements with deceptive reasoning.\n\nGoogle, you’ve had 100+ days to do the right thing.\nInstead, you chose to insult your customers’ intelligence and risk their safety.",

I will try to capture an image and the HDR processing gets stuck, but never completes and never saves the image. \n\n  \nI can restart my phone, and the photos and camera app will work again. But as soon as I try to share a photo to a different app, everything messes up again until I restart my phone again.  This has only started in the last few days (Oct. 25 20205).\n\n  \nAnyone have a similar experience? Or a fix? Thanks.",

Sure, the battery is noticeably worse, but still, with my usage, I can get a full day of usage and even more, just charging to 80%. And I can't even speak about the pleasure of using the Pixel keyboard compared to the iPhone one, just different tiers. I feel that the Pixel is smoother, maybe due to the absence of the horrid Liquid Glass animations; I feel the transaction between different apps more seamless. \n\nHowever there is a single instance in which the iPhone, for my taste, is incredibly superior (except for battery and integration across devices): the quality of the display. The colours of the iPhone are brighter and gorgeous, and at the same level of brightness setting, the Pixel has a darker display, with way less brilliant colours.\n\nDo you feel the same? ",

    "selftext": "Up until this Wednesday evening, I was almost happy with my phone - some hiccups though over the span of 12 months - blank screen, sudden hang ups, brightness issues, overheating when using video etc. Despite all these bugs, this was the best android phone I had ever used - sleek, stylish, smooth and snappy.....buggy though..... - but tough love!! <3 \n\nJust after making a call, I pressed the power button. Little did I know this would be the last time I would have used the device. It died! No matter how many CPRs ([Google Pixel 9 Pro (XL) Black Screen Of Death? (SOLVED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRwlpGb1gqk)) I would try!!! Then came the awakening. I visited the so called Google Exclusive Service Center in Bengaluru where I had to pay 850INR for inspection and on request they said the diagnosis would be done on priority. After 30 minutes, I went back and I was told the bad news which I expected anyways - \"The motherboard has died. You would need to pay 43000 INR for its replacement. Since it is already almost 2 months the warranty expired, this is not covered\" - The tone was not even consoling...haha....it was pitiful....I am a fairly average user with most of my usage being entertainment and browsing....this came as a shock to me!!\n\nI feel appalled because unlike our US counterparts, Indians have to shell out a major portion of their monthly salary to buy these flagship phones. Imagine earning 2Lacs a month and paying 1.25 Lacs for the device which promised 7 years of OS updates when ironically it is not even able to guarantee 14 months of lifespan.....IMHO this is pure deception and scam being inflicted on the people. I know this is not unlike other companies but hey at least OnePlus has owned its defects and came back with friendlier policies and even expanded it to India. It has ensured to expand its official service centres with very good staff across every major cities in the country unlike Google which has not bothered yet to work on after sales.\n\nThis was a lesson for me on a variety of topics in this life - from consumerism to capitalism, from self reflection to self destruction - we should not fall to marketing gimmicks and shenanigans these BigTech employ to make you feel like you are missing something if you dont have their products. I have learned a valuable lesson that **Don't buy a product which has close to negligible after sales service and negligible empathy for customers**. While Google does have a great software team, its hardware offerings are meh! I feel I cheated on my OP7T which still work like butter even now! Sorry OP!!!!!! \\_/\\\\\\_   \nI held back on buying a flagship phone for almost 10 years and now I think I should never have. :(\n\nI should have never expected in the first place that a company with such a poor and pathetic track record with hardware can create magical experience with mobile phones. After all phones are not just their looks. What matters the most is whether they can walk significantly with you in your life and whether the manufacturer actually has this intention. I am pretty sure Google doesn't especially not in countries like India.",

I'm a fairly new Pixel user (had a 7 Pro for about 6 months before getting the 10 Pro) and I can't seem to find the answer to this.    \nWhy can I not use the volume buttons to take a picture in Google Lens? I've been searching for an answer for a few hours and I keep landing on \"change the settings for the main camera app, if this doesn't work, uninstall and reinstall Camera App updates\". This has not worked and I can't figure out why it works in the camera app but not Google lens.    \nFor clarity, I am pressing the camera icon in the Google search bar at the bottom of the home screen as I use this multiple times a day. It's a minor gripe but I'm often using my phone one-handed and having to juggle my grip to press the shutter button on-screen is a kerfuffle.    \n    \nAm I being an idiot and missing a simple solution or do I need to download something third-party to circumvent this?    \n    \nI appreciate any feedback and I've now joined this sub because I've already found some useful tips I didn't know I needed!

Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

Now I’m looking at the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra and wanted to hear from people who’ve spent time with them.\n\nOn paper they seem very close, but I’m curious about how they actually feel day to day. How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

But that was my fault to not have backup.\n\n\n\nAnyway, i gotten a cheap Xiaomi phone to use until i was back to my country since i acquired Samsung care+.\n\nOnce returned and submitted it to the Samsung costumer center they mentioned few times, it will be a free repair unless water damage is detected.\n\nOf course, i kept the phone relatively well, but it received its shares of water splashes, and knowing very well what waterproof mean in the phone world i was ready to pay the 93\\~USD of screen change out of warranty. (The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra? I guess i use it as a Dex PC. ",

I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed.

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use?

However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I’ve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I usually get around 2.5 days(almost 3 if I strech it) on a full charge. Completely different story if lte is on tho.\n\nI track my sleep everyday. Last night as I was going to bed I noticed the batter was @ 11% and couldn't be bothered to wait for it to charge. So I turned of Bluetooth, then put airplane mode so lte dosent turn on nd then tucked in for the night.\n\nThis morning I wake up, lo nd behold the battery has gone down just 3%! Usually it consumes almost 12 to 15% everynight. Not just that, I reconnected it to my phone and it had tracked my sleep(along with hr and breathing) properly like it does everyday.\n\nThe thing is, in the battery section of settings it just shows what apps are using the battery which all combined isn't even 20%. \n\nSo, while being connected to the phone while your awake is non negotiable, ig it works if u want to just make it last a little longer in case u don't want to turn health features off \n\nEdit: what a weird coincidence, that someone asked a question on batter drain during night as I was writing this post, lol\n\nEdit2: corrected first line from hrs to days, sry",

I find the former more attractive but both seem to have similar activity and health metrics, which I'm more interested in.\n\nI'm swimming (pool and open water) and will start running; both not rigorously/competitive but for good health. I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

    "title": "Knew my Ultra HR sensor was messed up but this is shockingly bad.",
    "selftext": "Bought my GW Ultra late last year when they were giving insane deals/trade-ins and was blown away by how good it was.  However, over the last few months, my HR has been becoming completely unusable as the numbers would jump around so much that I knew they weren't correct.  (I've been a distance runner for almost twenty years so I know my HR very well and I knew the watch was giving poor info.)  I've had a couple of forced resets of my watch and even starting over from scratch has not improved things.\n\nFor my birthday last week, I got a gift card to Amazon and I decided to finally purchase a HR monitor with a chest strap.  Found an unbelievable deal on one for only $20 and thought I'd try it.  Today, on its first run, I saw just how bad my Ultra was really performing.\n\nIn the pic below, the top picture is the still very new Ultra during a 2.5 mile run.  It climbs steadily until reaching my \"cruising\" HR, which will usually be between 145-155, depending on my exertion level that day.  The top pic is very acceptable to me.  I was doing a lot of HR zone training back then and with a good HR sensor, it was easily accomplished.\n\nThe bottom pic is today's run, a 1.55 mile treadmill run.  (Sorry, it was 38 degrees and raining, so not going outside!)  You can see a very similar HR pattern as the new Ultra had in the top pic.  A steady climb into the cruising zone and stayed there for the duration.  Never got above 150 the entire time.\n\nThe middle pic is yesterday's run, one mile on the treadmill using the Ultra only.  Wow, what a disaster.  All over the place and a couple of minute-long flatlines.  Also, notice the high of 171, which I know my heart never came near.  Definitely a cadence-lock issue, because my running cadence is always between 168 and 174.\n\nI'm one of those tactile-intolerant people and I thought for sure I'd hate running with this strap on my chest but I barely even noticed it the entire time.  The beauty is, once SportWerks has discovered the BLE device, it is stored and it will automatically find the device every time in the future so as long as I remember to put it on, it's as simple as that.\n\nNot sure why these things simply \"go bad\" but apparently, mine has.  Sharing this because I've seen enough posts from other runners/cyclists to know they are also having HR sensor issues.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn17yc8ijxwf1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a25d27193cc4e24239c1554d50b2a76870b84e\n\n",

Apps will be featured based on how often you use them and other usage patterns. You can also view your apps as a list with names instead of only icons.\n\nChoose calendars to show on your watch  \nYou can now choose which calendars to show in the Calendar app on your watch. You can show all of the same calendars that are on your phone or customize to show only the calendars you need.\n\n  \n**Sadly there are no any:**\n\n  \nTrack your vascular load  \nUse your Galaxy Watch to measure your vascular load, which is the amount of stress on your blood vessels. First, take a baseline measurement, then you'll be able to see when your vascular load gets higher or lower over time.  \n  \nCheck your antioxidant intake  \nThe Antioxidant index (Labs) feature on your watch detects the level of carotenoids in your skin. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant contained in fruits and vegetables that can help prevent physical aging.\n\nP.S. It's not bad update overall, but most important features as always Samsung hold just for Ultra models.",

    "selftext": "I have to say, despite how much I love my own personal Galaxy Watch 7 44mm + Galaxy Ring combo, I think that the Fit 3 deserves some tremendous respect for getting so many things right.\n\nI've set three different people up with a Fit 3 so far, with great success.  \n\n\\-It's cheap.  Not everyone is into spending hundreds on a Smartwatch or Ring.\n\n\\-It has great battery life.  I'm fine with the shorter battery life of my Watch 7, but I know that none of these people I set up with a Fit 3 would put up with having to charge their watch every 1-2 days.\n\n\\-It's not bulky.  I don't consider my Watch 7 bulky either, certainly not compared to something like a Watch Ultra, but the Fit 3 is a truly lightweight device.\n\n\\-Has all the basic smartwatch features covered.  I'm amazed how well it integrates with Google Messages when receiving texts.  It's great that it still shows you when you are getting a call (even though you can't answer them).  It handles all the core health tracking.  Built-in find-your-phone feature, fall alerts, etc.\n\n\\-Low maintenance.  No apps that need to update constantly.  The Fit 3 itself turns on and off very quick.  This also makes it a great backup watch.  My old Watch 4 Classic on the other-hand, I have to turn it on periodically just to keep the apps updated and it takes a while, uses maybe 10% of the battery just finishing the boot-up process.\n\n  \nNow obviously each watch has it's own pros and cons, but the Fit 3 does a really great job at not just being a cheap watch, but actually doing certain things better than the more expensive watches and creating a great option to bring a big group of people into the Samsung smartwatch / Samsung health ecosystem.",

    "selftext": "I usually get around 2.5 days(almost 3 if I strech it) on a full charge. Completely different story if lte is on tho.\n\nI track my sleep everyday. Last night as I was going to bed I noticed the batter was @ 11% and couldn't be bothered to wait for it to charge. So I turned of Bluetooth, then put airplane mode so lte dosent turn on nd then tucked in for the night.\n\nThis morning I wake up, lo nd behold the battery has gone down just 3%! Usually it consumes almost 12 to 15% everynight. Not just that, I reconnected it to my phone and it had tracked my sleep(along with hr and breathing) properly like it does everyday.\n\nThe thing is, in the battery section of settings it just shows what apps are using the battery which all combined isn't even 20%. \n\nSo, while being connected to the phone while your awake is non negotiable, ig it works if u want to just make it last a little longer in case u don't want to turn health features off \n\nEdit: what a weird coincidence, that someone asked a question on batter drain during night as I was writing this post, lol\n\nEdit2: corrected first line from hrs to days, sry",

I find the former more attractive but both seem to have similar activity and health metrics, which I'm more interested in.\n\nI'm swimming (pool and open water) and will start running; both not rigorously/competitive but for good health. I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

And are there any other disadvantages compared to the 7?\n\nWhat Ill use the watch for:\n- Running\n- Sleep\n- Notifications\n- Heart rate \n- ECG\n- Track tasks\n- Alarms\n- ....\n\n\nThe price is similar if it matters.\n\nThe 8 classic is nearly 3X as expensive, so it is not an option.",

Those two types of sheet has same thickness (0.25mm), so there's definitely something wrong with my heatsink's flatness.\n\nIs there anything I can do to solve this? I really want to use graphite sheets because it was a day and night difference on my previous laptop, and the current one has a very very hot CPU. A new heatsink unit apparently costs about **$180** on aliexpress by a bit shady seller, so I wanted ask here before I have to consider that option.  \n\n\nThings that I have tried so far but didn't help:\n\n\\- Pushing down the heatsink on the CPU side when reassembling screws  \n\\- Applied thermal paste instead of pad/putty to VRAM/VRM/etc thinking that it would 'yield' better contact on the CPU side  \n\\- Putting slightly thicker (0.5mm to 1.0mm) thermal pads on the opposite side of the heatsink (GPU VRAM) thinking that it would 'tilt' slightly down to the CPU side when screwed  \n\\- Unscrewing the motherboard from the laptop housing and reassembling it",

    "title": "Need a Suggestion for getting a laptop",
    "selftext": "My budget is INR 90K, and I need suggestions for getting a new laptop. I am using my brother's HP i5 8th U series laptop, and the motherboard died yesterday. I am looking forward to buying a new laptop. I have savings of 90k, and that's my budget. I am a CSE student in my first year, and my usage is:\n\n* AI and ML coding (Entry to Moderate) (learning phase still)\n* Video editing and Photo editing (Entry Level to Moderate)\n* Excel, Power BI, and data visualization, and some other software\n* No gaming.\n* I will use the laptop for 5 to 6 years.\n* May use some CRM tools or analytics tools in the future.\n\nI am thinking of buying an Ultra 7 255H processor and found out it has performance issues. I had also wishlisted the Lenovo Aura Edition Yoga Pro 7 Intel Core Ultra 7 255H. But I am confused now whether to go for gaming laptops or general laptops. I heard Core Ultra 7 laptops compromise on performance compared to gaming series, but I am confused whether I need that much powerful processing power or not. My priority is battery, weight, and portability, but I can manage weight if the system offers performance.\n\nAlso, I am looking for 32 GB RAM variants and a 1 TB SSD. Is it better to go with those versions, or can I upgrade later when needed, which will be more cost-efficient?",

It worked for a while, but then the charger short-circuited, and later my GPU stopped working. The motherboard had to be repaired, which cost me ₹5,500.\n\nThe seller replaced the charger under warranty, but after about two months, it short-circuited again. I’m worried the charger damaged my laptop.\n\nNow I’m unsure what to do original HP chargers are quite expensive, but I don’t want to risk another failure.\n\nWhich charger should I go for now? Are refurbished HP chargers safe, or should I only buy new originals?\nAny advice or trusted sources to buy from (in India) would be really helpful.\n",

I currently have a 2016 HP Pavillion with a 15.6\" screen, 16 ram, and a 2tb hard drive. It's got many problems with it, one of the worst being that I'm tethered to an outlet as it doesn't last more than 20ish minites without dying. I did do a bit of research before buying that laptop, but so much has changed in 9 years especially with these new AI 🙄 laptops. I was looking at Best Buy and they seemed uber expensive for not a lot behind it simply because it's a Copilot one or whatever. \n\nMy usage: I have multiple tabs/programs open often. I already am using Excel in most of my MBA classes, and I will eventually be using SAS software in my public health classes. I utilize my laptop heavily for personal use as well. I need this laptop to be able to keep up in terms of processing speed. A good battery life is also highly important as I have 3 hour classes where there are literally 4 outlets in the classroom and I don't always get one of the outlets. \n\nMy requirements: at least 16gb of ram, an SSD hard drive, a numeric/full keyboard (I use it alllllll the time) that is also backlit, and at least a 15\" screen. I am anti-Apple, please don't suggest Macbooks.\n\nMy budget is $1200 ish USD. Please help, I'm terrified to buy a laptop that can't keep up and/or the battery life is trash. I want to have this laptop for at least 5+ years, ideally longer. ",

Avoid Infinix and any brand associated with Carlcare at all costs.\n\n\nI bought an Infinix Zerobook 13 i9 for 60K, and within just 14 months I faced two major issues.\n\nThe first time, the motherboard had to be replaced, thankfully it was under warranty.\n\nThe second time, some keyboard keys stopped working. It has been more than three months of running around service centers and customer care for a simple keyboard replacement, and there is still no solution. The part is not available anywhere in the market. Customer care and service centers are completely unhelpful, and they even blocked my number after repeated follow-ups.\n\nAt this point, the only option left is to throw this laptop in the trash. Can't use external keyboard in F2F interview.\n\nInfinix products are pure frustration. Stay away if you value your money and peace of mind.",

The weight distribution is off, and whenever I type, my laptop display wiggles constantly.\nMy old Amazon Basics cooling pad didn’t cool as well, but it was stable and fit my laptop perfectly.

Mine got only one.\n\nSo i was checking and thinking of buying a hub for type C, and I noticed options are very limited in my market. And some of theese hubs are not clear whether your device would be recognized by them or they only do file transfer job… moreover, most of these hubs just have other type of ports. I can’t find a USB C hub that gives you 3 or 4 usb C ports, the way we see in USB A hubs. The existing usb c hubs are mostly having different types of ports rather than usb c.\n\nWhat sort of hub should i look for? Whats the solution?",

But they have no control\n\n-I’m sorry for not giving specific stats. My work laptop is at work and I am home for the weekend. I have written down what you guys want and will update on Monday\n\n-Also my job is weird. I do all the catch all stuff- so my work widely varies (when most ppl just have the one thing they do all day) so I’m the odd one out with the amount of spreads that I depend on and monitors. \n\n\nI work in healthcare, and have a basic Lenovo Laptop (wasn’t my choice haha- so please don’t judge). It’s a few years old and only has 8 GB RAM. \n\nAnd it crashes CONSTANTLY. I have to restart it at least once a day, and clear my cache and cookies several times a day. \n\nMy Teams app has a severe delay. I also use like 15 spreadsheets that I operate through Microsoft edge (most of them are shared on a one drive). \n\nSo I have 3 monitors. 1 is for my edge excel workspace (with 9-12 sheets), the other monitor is mainly used for my company worksites that we use to update the spreadsheets. And the third is used for Outlook and other misc spread sheets on one drive. \n\nI feel like I’m wasting half my day waiting for teams or the spreadsheets to respond. I tried to reach out to our IT and all they tell me is to restart and clear my cache and cookies. How do I convince my IT that I need a bigger laptop?",

Those two types of sheet has same thickness (0.25mm), so there's definitely something wrong with my heatsink's flatness.\n\nIs there anything I can do to solve this?

A new heatsink unit apparently costs about **$180** on aliexpress by a bit shady seller, so I wanted ask here before I have to consider that option.  \n\n\nThings that I have tried so far but didn't help:\n\n\\- Pushing down the heatsink on the CPU side when reassembling screws  \n\\- Applied thermal paste instead of pad/putty to VRAM/VRM/etc thinking that it would 'yield' better contact on the CPU side  \n\\- Putting slightly thicker (0.5mm to 1.0mm) thermal pads on the opposite side of the heatsink (GPU VRAM) thinking that it would 'tilt' slightly down to the CPU side when screwed  \n\\- Unscrewing the motherboard from the laptop housing and reassembling it",

    "title": "Decent Laptop for an MPH/MBA Student (Budget is $1200ish USD)",
    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm a new graduate student in a Master of Public Health and Master of Business Administration program in the US. I currently have a 2016 HP Pavillion with a 15.6\" screen, 16 ram, and a 2tb hard drive. It's got many problems with it, one of the worst being that I'm tethered to an outlet as it doesn't last more than 20ish minites without dying. I did do a bit of research before buying that laptop, but so much has changed in 9 years especially with these new AI 🙄 laptops. I was looking at Best Buy and they seemed uber expensive for not a lot behind it simply because it's a Copilot one or whatever. \n\nMy usage: I have multiple tabs/programs open often. I already am using Excel in most of my MBA classes, and I will eventually be using SAS software in my public health classes. I utilize my laptop heavily for personal use as well. I need this laptop to be able to keep up in terms of processing speed. A good battery life is also highly important as I have 3 hour classes where there are literally 4 outlets in the classroom and I don't always get one of the outlets. \n\nMy requirements: at least 16gb of ram, an SSD hard drive, a numeric/full keyboard (I use it alllllll the time) that is also backlit, and at least a 15\" screen. I am anti-Apple, please don't suggest Macbooks.\n\nMy budget is $1200 ish USD. Please help, I'm terrified to buy a laptop that can't keep up and/or the battery life is trash. I want to have this laptop for at least 5+ years, ideally longer. ",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’m a university student (BBA program) and I also do some graphic design work on the side. I’m based in Bangladesh and I’m looking for a good second-hand laptop within a budget of around ৳25-30k.\n\nHere’s what I’m looking for in the laptop: I need a decent processor like an Intel Core i5 (8th gen or newer) or an AMD Ryzen equivalent, with at least 8 GB of RAM — ideally 16 GB if possible — so that I can smoothly run both my uni tasks (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Zoom) and my design tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.). I’d prefer SSD storage (256 GB or more) for faster performance, and a Full HD display with decent colour accuracy since I’ll be doing design work. The laptop should be in good condition, with no major screen or keyboard issues and a battery that still holds charge. I’d also like something durable and reliable, preferably from a known brand, and ideally from a seller that allows me to check the laptop before buying.\n\n\nSo, my question for the community: if you were to suggest me a laptop to buy price range (৳25-30k) in or around, which model do i get?\n\nThanks in advance for any help or recommendations! 🙏",

    "selftext": "Man, I don’t get what is this obsession with Type-C when many mid-range laptops don’t even have many Type-C ports on them. I mean why does a mouse or keyboard has to be type C when it doesn’t really do high data transfer. Then, the laptop manufacturers don’t even bother to put at least 3 or 4 type C ports on their modes. Mine got only one.\n\nSo i was checking and thinking of buying a hub for type C, and I noticed options are very limited in my market. And some of theese hubs are not clear whether your device would be recognized by them or they only do file transfer job… moreover, most of these hubs just have other type of ports. I can’t find a USB C hub that gives you 3 or 4 usb C ports, the way we see in USB A hubs. The existing usb c hubs are mostly having different types of ports rather than usb c.\n\nWhat sort of hub should i look for? Whats the solution?",

I do all the catch all stuff- so my work widely varies (when most ppl just have the one thing they do all day) so I’m the odd one out with the amount of spreads that I depend on and monitors. \n\n\nI work in healthcare, and have a basic Lenovo Laptop (wasn’t my choice haha- so please don’t judge). It’s a few years old and only has 8 GB RAM. \n\nAnd it crashes CONSTANTLY. I have to restart it at least once a day, and clear my cache and cookies several times a day. \n\nMy Teams app has a severe delay. I also use like 15 spreadsheets that I operate through Microsoft edge (most of them are shared on a one drive). \n\nSo I have 3 monitors. 1 is for my edge excel workspace (with 9-12 sheets), the other monitor is mainly used for my company worksites that we use to update the spreadsheets. And the third is used for Outlook and other misc spread sheets on one drive. \n\nI feel like I’m wasting half my day waiting for teams or the spreadsheets to respond. I tried to reach out to our IT and all they tell me is to restart and clear my cache and cookies. How do I convince my IT that I need a bigger laptop?",

It has been more than three months of running around service centers and customer care for a simple keyboard replacement, and there is still no solution. The part is not available anywhere in the market.

    "selftext": "I have an ASUS laptop (2024 TUF A15 FA507XI) with RTX4070 and Ryzen 7940HS.\n\nI found out the entire right-half side of my CPU wasn't making contact with heatsink when I used a graphite sheet.  \n  \nSo tried out PTM7950 sheet instead, and unfortunately result was exactly same. Those two types of sheet has same thickness (0.25mm), so there's definitely something wrong with my heatsink's flatness.\n\nIs there anything I can do to solve this? I really want to use graphite sheets because it was a day and night difference on my previous laptop, and the current one has a very very hot CPU. A new heatsink unit apparently costs about **$180** on aliexpress by a bit shady seller, so I wanted ask here before I have to consider that option.  \n\n\nThings that I have tried so far but didn't help:\n\n\\- Pushing down the heatsink on the CPU side when reassembling screws  \n\\- Applied thermal paste instead of pad/putty to VRAM/VRM/etc thinking that it would 'yield' better contact on the CPU side  \n\\- Putting slightly thicker (0.5mm to 1.0mm) thermal pads on the opposite side of the heatsink (GPU VRAM) thinking that it would 'tilt' slightly down to the CPU side when screwed  \n\\- Unscrewing the motherboard from the laptop housing and reassembling it",

    "selftext": "When working in Auto-Fan mode, I noticed that when switching to the operating mode of the RTX 3070ti video card coolers, one of the fans constantly starts spinning and stops. Works apart from others. This is very noticeable in the indicators in the program. One of them either starts spinning later than everyone else, or faster than the other two. Moreover, the number of revolutions is always different, and because of this, there is a constant sound of a fading cooler.\n\nSurprisingly, if you do not work in Auto-Fan mode and set the settings so that the coolers work already at certain speeds, everything will work correctly.\n\nHowever, even in this case, I noticed a difference in speed between the coolers, albeit a minimal one: The rpm of the two coolers is always constant - 1256/1256 or 825/825. But one of them (the most extreme) always has, for some reason, always, albeit minimally, a different rpm. For example, when both coolers have 1256 rpm, he will have 1250, or when they have 1520 rpm, he will have 1518.\n\nIs there any suggestion what it might be? Can you give me some minimally simple tips that could fix this ailment? I will accept anything from simple methods to visiting a repair service.\n\nI use a translator, so I'm sorry if I can't always understand the answer.",

After playing with BIOS settings A-XMP profile 1-3, I noticed that the crash happens when going over 4800 MHZ.\nFast forward to yesterday, I started playing a game with heavy system load @4800 MHz ram speed, after about 40 minutes it crashed again.\nSince then I haven't been able to boot the system with 2 ram sticks in A2/B2.\n\nThings I've tried since then:\n\nReset CMOS - reseated battery after 10 minutes, shortened jumper on Mainboard\n\nReseated the cpu couple of times, cleaned the thermal paste - loosened the cooler screws since I've read that tightening them too hard may cause ram instability\n\nThe system still boots with only 1 ram stick in A2 without any issues. As soon as I add the other stick, Red CPU yellow dram\nThe same goes for all the other slots, using A1 B1 B2 with a single ram stick, doesn't boot, with the same problem occuring. \nI've tried both sticks separately in A2, both were able to boot the system which suggets they re not the problem.\n\nI've read that bent pins on the socket cause memory issues, I've inspected the socket carefully and couldn't see any. I will add pictures of the socket and CPU, maybe someone notices anything. \n\nDoes anyone have ideas on how to fix the issue? I'm starting to get very desperate with this new system..\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XFZXeMz",

    "title": "[Help] PC says CPU is running hot, BIOS says otherwise.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone. About a month or so ago I did practically a full PC upgrade, upgrading my GPU, CPU, RAM, Motherboard etc etc. The PC itself has mostly been running fine, but there's been one issue I'm confused about.\n\nFrom cold booting my PC after having it off all night, my CPU temps claim to be wildly high. I first went of the task manager's GPU1 (or my integrated graphics) temp but now use CoreTemp. They both say that my CPU is 70°-90°C idle on startup. My PC itself however isn't at all hot from booting up, and the BIOS aswell. I just turned my PC on this morning and went to BIOS and it said the temp was in the 30°-40°C range. Then I fully went in and CoreTemp claimed it was at about 80°-90°C.\n\nThe only way I can fix this is by restarting my PC once or twice when it \"hits\" about 90 or so Celsius. I initially thought it could be an overheating problem since my fan setup is pretty weak and I wasn't able to upgrade it and I also dont have an AIO, but my PC itself doesn't feel hot when I turn it on and when its idle, and actually putting my CPU under stress via games don't cause it to overheat either, always hovering at about 70-80°C which is to be expected under pressure.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas for how this could be fixed short out of buying new fans/an AIO (I already purchased a brand new case which is coming today since my current one  is decently old and the new one can display temps), I'd be very grateful.\n\nSpec List:\nNvidia Geforce RTX 5070 12GB VRAM\n\nRyzen 7 7700X 4501 MHz\n\nGigabyte B650 Gaming X AX V2\n\n32 GB of DDR5 RAM\n\n2x 1 TB M.2 SSDs\n\n750W Power Supply (not sure of the exact brand)\n\nOS: Windows 10 Home\n\nI'm not exactly sure of my fan setup, but there's one fan near the back of my PC (above my GPU and PSU) and two on the front of it (next to my power button and USB ports)",

They've been through a lot and I want to do something nice. I'm going to keep their price around $700, but I'm willing to double that to provide something good for them.\n\nI've put together a list of components - would anyone be able to double check me or provide improvements? Looks like everything is compatible and no bottlenecks between CPU / GPU. PSU may be overkill based on estimations, but I have had issues with spikes in the past, so hoping that's not an issue with going for a bit higher wattage.\n\nAny advice will be great!

    "selftext": "My idea is to make something to compete with MFF setups, but still utilize full atx style mobo and psu.  \n\n  \nIt involves mounting the gpu vertically but flat over the aio (will require an aio or flat cpu cooler) where there is a riser and a bracket inside the case to do so which means you need to run your cables inside the case for gpu output.\n\n  \nDoing this also allows the psu to be laid flat sorta over the ram area but not to impede access.  Should be enough room to add 120mm fans for intake, or potentially use a single 200mm fan on the side of the case over the gpu/cpu with optimized airflow exits so that hopefully a single 200mm would satisfy case temps.  Since using a 240mm rad would give enough leeway for cpu temps.  Realistically the only heat issue would be the gpu since it would be dumping heat completely inside the case, but that's the idea of the 200mm.  It should move enough cfm to handle even a 7900xtx/5090.  If my math adds up that is.\n\n  \nI'd appreciate input from others if possible too.  Will my idea even work?  Does it need tweaking?",

Since then I've been thinking my RAM is not 100% healthy.\n\nWhen I got the 9070xt installed it, updated the new drivers and tested some games.\n\n* Cyberpunk 2077 ran perfect.\n* Resident Evil 2 ran perfect but had certain stutters.\n* Games that are less intense/modern/\"Pretty\" ran okay.\n\nHowever:\n\n* Witcher 3 crashes every 10 seconds or so.\n* RDR2 crashes between 30 seconds and 5 minutes.\n* CONTROL had intense stutter and low FPS while moving the character/camera.\n\nAt this point I didn't try more games, the issue was something else.\n\nBefore anything I also benchmarked the GPU with heaven and fumark. It went good.\n\nUndervolted the GPU, lowered the clocks, tried at stock... nothing.\n\n\n\nThe only thing that solved it was disabling EXPO yesterday... but only worked yesterday evening, today without EXPO it crashes again... so decided to spent all morning running memtest86 and got... 0 errors.\n\nI still think that something is not working properly with my RAM since the BIOS update but that wouldn't explain these crashes with so many games with different UV and settings applied and, at this point, unless someone can give me some information or insight... I'm just considering returning the 9070xt and continue with the igpu until a new sale arrives.\n\nI don't know how to fix it. Any ideas?\n\nThanks a lot, seriously.",

That way I can use the MSI OPTIX MAG271CQR as the second monitor. What sort of monitor would you all suggest? My budget would be 400 AUD. I was thinking of something similar size so around 27\" since it's a nice size.  \n  \nCurrently, the MSI OPTIX MAG271CQR is getting screen flickering when I set it to 144hz. I was thinking maybe it was the cable, but looking online, I see it could also be the graphics card? I don't know too much about all of this, but wanted other people's expert opinions before I went out to buy new parts.",

They replaced the motherboard, and I bought a brand new PSU (Gigabyte P450B) as well because before that, I used a cheap casing-free PSU -,-.\n\nAfter 6 months, one day when I turned on the wall switch, I got an electric shock, and our strip breaker tripped. Then I took it to the shop, and they gave me a brand new PSU. Everything was normal and okay after that.\n\nAfter 4–5 months, I got the same freeze problem again. I took it to the shop, and they said maybe it’s a GPU problem. They told me they ran the PC without the GPU, and it was running normally.

I am not very well acquainted as I usually buy new pc parts, install them, give it a quick check in the bios, boot up and start playing games 😅. And don’t bother too much to check things too much, like overheating and what not. I know I should…but I get lazy thinking it’s new so it will be fine. ",

    "selftext": "Hey all, \n\n  \nIt's been a good bit since I've touched my PC and since it's starting to have its jitters (and I have some income to spend) I'm wanting to give the old bastard a makeover. One factor with this is that I believe either the cpu or the motherboard is no longer functioning quite right. I've been having issues with my keyboard unplugging itself, game freezing and weird noises in my headphones. I don't really need help troubleshooting (believe me, I've tried) but I'm pretty sure the problem is my motherboard OR my CPU. They may have gotten a bit too hot/the thermal gel a bit too old at one point (fixed now). \n\nEither way, currently I'm running a 1080, a Ryzen 5 3600 on a B550M steel legend. I have 650 W to play with on a corsair bronze certified PSU. I was initially just going to get my CPU upgraded to a 5700x3d or 5800x3d, since those seem to be *the thing* for AM4 and I didn't particularly want the hassle of pulling out my entire motherboard. I'm not averse to the second hand market but they seem to be going for relatively crazy prices, anywhere between 200 and 350 euro. \n\nHowever, poking around a bit I've found that a 9600x and a B850 together are only around 375 NEW. There's a kit of those + 32GB RAM for about 600 euro, which seems significantly more money efficient. I'm having a hard time judging how impactful that cache of the x3d is, and wether to stick it out with AM4 or just jump to AM5 now. I'll have to buy some extra ram regardless (currently only have 16) but the DDR5 seems very expensive for RAM. \n\nSo my questions are: \n\n\\- Is the 5800x3d/5700x3d *really* that good or is getting an AM5 CPU without the cache better/as good?   \n\\- Can my PSU handle jumping to AM5?   \n\\- How insane will I be if I run the 1080 on an AM5 motherboard and/or what would a good upgrade be for it?

I was originally thinking of a Rtx 5070 but having 12gb vram doesn’t seem ideal, especially if I wanted to use 4k. I then thought, would a 9060xt be good enough. Maybe not for 4k but just to get it working at all. I’m in Ireland so the price of a 5070 is &550-650+ and rx 9060xt €420+. My other option is just wait for the super variant of the 5070 but that’s gonna be a while\n",

Mobo is MSI B650.\n\nEvery couple of days the audio and mic completely goes dead, meaning I do not have any audio through my headset, or speakers. Also the mic on the headset stops working.\n\nThe only way to fix this is to delete the Realtek Audio Driver in Windows Device Managemant -> Search for Windows Updates -> it then says theres an update available because it spots the missing audio driver -> install update en restart PC.\n\nAfterwards audio works fine on both speakers and headset. This leads me to believe its a Realtek audio driver issue.\n\nAnyone has had similar issues or knows a fix that doesn't involve me reinstalling Realtek constantly?\n\nI'm on Windows 11 and using a Logitech Speaker set (connected through jack) and a Razer Barracuda X Chroma Wireless Headset (connected through Dongle).\n\nThings I tried that do not work:\n-replugging speakers and headset\n-updating realtek audio drivers\n\n",

I've been at this for at least 3 hours now and I'm just over it. I can't for the life of me figure out why this is refusing to align, and I think I'm just going to chip away at that top-left standoff to force it to be level, unless someone here can see something I've missed.

    "selftext": "When working in Auto-Fan mode, I noticed that when switching to the operating mode of the RTX 3070ti video card coolers, one of the fans constantly starts spinning and stops. Works apart from others. This is very noticeable in the indicators in the program. One of them either starts spinning later than everyone else, or faster than the other two. Moreover, the number of revolutions is always different, and because of this, there is a constant sound of a fading cooler.\n\nSurprisingly, if you do not work in Auto-Fan mode and set the settings so that the coolers work already at certain speeds, everything will work correctly.\n\nHowever, even in this case, I noticed a difference in speed between the coolers, albeit a minimal one: The rpm of the two coolers is always constant - 1256/1256 or 825/825. But one of them (the most extreme) always has, for some reason, always, albeit minimally, a different rpm. For example, when both coolers have 1256 rpm, he will have 1250, or when they have 1520 rpm, he will have 1518.\n\nIs there any suggestion what it might be? Can you give me some minimally simple tips that could fix this ailment? I will accept anything from simple methods to visiting a repair service.\n\nI use a translator, so I'm sorry if I can't always understand the answer.",

After playing with BIOS settings A-XMP profile 1-3, I noticed that the crash happens when going over 4800 MHZ.\nFast forward to yesterday, I started playing a game with heavy system load @4800 MHz ram speed, after about 40 minutes it crashed again.\nSince then I haven't been able to boot the system with 2 ram sticks in A2/B2.\n\nThings I've tried since then:\n\nReset CMOS - reseated battery after 10 minutes, shortened jumper on Mainboard\n\nReseated the cpu couple of times, cleaned the thermal paste - loosened the cooler screws since I've read that tightening them too hard may cause ram instability\n\nThe system still boots with only 1 ram stick in A2 without any issues. As soon as I add the other stick, Red CPU yellow dram\nThe same goes for all the other slots, using A1 B1 B2 with a single ram stick, doesn't boot, with the same problem occuring. \nI've tried both sticks separately in A2, both were able to boot the system which suggets they re not the problem.\n\nI've read that bent pins on the socket cause memory issues, I've inspected the socket carefully and couldn't see any. I will add pictures of the socket and CPU, maybe someone notices anything. \n\nDoes anyone have ideas on how to fix the issue? I'm starting to get very desperate with this new system..\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XFZXeMz",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. About a month or so ago I did practically a full PC upgrade, upgrading my GPU, CPU, RAM, Motherboard etc etc. The PC itself has mostly been running fine, but there's been one issue I'm confused about.\n\nFrom cold booting my PC after having it off all night, my CPU temps claim to be wildly high. I first went of the task manager's GPU1 (or my integrated graphics) temp but now use CoreTemp. They both say that my CPU is 70°-90°C idle on startup. My PC itself however isn't at all hot from booting up, and the BIOS aswell. I just turned my PC on this morning and went to BIOS and it said the temp was in the 30°-40°C range. Then I fully went in and CoreTemp claimed it was at about 80°-90°C.\n\nThe only way I can fix this is by restarting my PC once or twice when it \"hits\" about 90 or so Celsius. I initially thought it could be an overheating problem since my fan setup is pretty weak and I wasn't able to upgrade it and I also dont have an AIO, but my PC itself doesn't feel hot when I turn it on and when its idle, and actually putting my CPU under stress via games don't cause it to overheat either, always hovering at about 70-80°C which is to be expected under pressure.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas for how this could be fixed short out of buying new fans/an AIO (I already purchased a brand new case which is coming today since my current one  is decently old and the new one can display temps), I'd be very grateful.\n\nSpec List:\nNvidia Geforce RTX 5070 12GB VRAM\n\nRyzen 7 7700X 4501 MHz\n\nGigabyte B650 Gaming X AX V2\n\n32 GB of DDR5 RAM\n\n2x 1 TB M.2 SSDs\n\n750W Power Supply (not sure of the exact brand)\n\nOS: Windows 10 Home\n\nI'm not exactly sure of my fan setup, but there's one fan near the back of my PC (above my GPU and PSU) and two on the front of it (next to my power button and USB ports)",

They're looking to do some light gaming, but I also want to be able to give them a good, all around, premium experience with 1440p and 144hz. They've been through a lot and I want to do something nice. I'm going to keep their price around $700, but I'm willing to double that to provide something good for them.\n\nI've put together a list of components - would anyone be able to double check me or provide improvements? Looks like everything is compatible and no bottlenecks between CPU / GPU. PSU may be overkill based on estimations, but I have had issues with spikes in the past, so hoping that's not an issue with going for a bit higher wattage.\n\nAny advice will be great!

    "selftext": "My idea is to make something to compete with MFF setups, but still utilize full atx style mobo and psu.  \n\n  \nIt involves mounting the gpu vertically but flat over the aio (will require an aio or flat cpu cooler) where there is a riser and a bracket inside the case to do so which means you need to run your cables inside the case for gpu output.\n\n  \nDoing this also allows the psu to be laid flat sorta over the ram area but not to impede access.  Should be enough room to add 120mm fans for intake, or potentially use a single 200mm fan on the side of the case over the gpu/cpu with optimized airflow exits so that hopefully a single 200mm would satisfy case temps.  Since using a 240mm rad would give enough leeway for cpu temps.  Realistically the only heat issue would be the gpu since it would be dumping heat completely inside the case, but that's the idea of the 200mm.  It should move enough cfm to handle even a 7900xtx/5090.  If my math adds up that is.\n\n  \nI'd appreciate input from others if possible too.  Will my idea even work?  Does it need tweaking?",

    "selftext": "When working in Auto-Fan mode, I noticed that when switching to the operating mode of the RTX 3070ti video card coolers, one of the fans constantly starts spinning and stops. Works apart from others. This is very noticeable in the indicators in the program. One of them either starts spinning later than everyone else, or faster than the other two. Moreover, the number of revolutions is always different, and because of this, there is a constant sound of a fading cooler.\n\nSurprisingly, if you do not work in Auto-Fan mode and set the settings so that the coolers work already at certain speeds, everything will work correctly.\n\nHowever, even in this case, I noticed a difference in speed between the coolers, albeit a minimal one: The rpm of the two coolers is always constant - 1256/1256 or 825/825. But one of them (the most extreme) always has, for some reason, always, albeit minimally, a different rpm. For example, when both coolers have 1256 rpm, he will have 1250, or when they have 1520 rpm, he will have 1518.\n\nIs there any suggestion what it might be? Can you give me some minimally simple tips that could fix this ailment? I will accept anything from simple methods to visiting a repair service.\n\nI use a translator, so I'm sorry if I can't always understand the answer.",

After playing with BIOS settings A-XMP profile 1-3, I noticed that the crash happens when going over 4800 MHZ.\nFast forward to yesterday, I started playing a game with heavy system load @4800 MHz ram speed, after about 40 minutes it crashed again.\nSince then I haven't been able to boot the system with 2 ram sticks in A2/B2.\n\nThings I've tried since then:\n\nReset CMOS - reseated battery after 10 minutes, shortened jumper on Mainboard\n\nReseated the cpu couple of times, cleaned the thermal paste - loosened the cooler screws since I've read that tightening them too hard may cause ram instability\n\nThe system still boots with only 1 ram stick in A2 without any issues. As soon as I add the other stick, Red CPU yellow dram\nThe same goes for all the other slots, using A1 B1 B2 with a single ram stick, doesn't boot, with the same problem occuring. \nI've tried both sticks separately in A2, both were able to boot the system which suggets they re not the problem.\n\nI've read that bent pins on the socket cause memory issues, I've inspected the socket carefully and couldn't see any. I will add pictures of the socket and CPU, maybe someone notices anything. \n\nDoes anyone have ideas on how to fix the issue? I'm starting to get very desperate with this new system..\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XFZXeMz",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

You can prove me wrong 😀\n\nGameplay consists of simple first person point-and-click mechanics. Where it stands out is interactivity. Environment is carefully hand-crafted with attention to detail, from the architecture of the buildings all the way down to the flushing sounds in the toilet.\n\nThe estimated length of the game is roughly 2 hours i would say. The length of the game depends on how fast you solve the puzzles. Some of them might be slightly on the more difficult side of the spectrum since they are a little bit unconventional.\n\n**Main features**\n\n* **Atmospheric first-person** mystery with light point-and-click style interactions.  \n* **Highly interactive environments** \\- almost everything reacts: drawers, switches, computers, instruments, sauna, etc.  \n* **Environmental storytelling**: newspapers, phones, and tiny props that hide clues.  \n* **Puzzles** that skew a bit **unconventional** \\- some are simple, a few are “huh… wait” moments by design.  \n\nBuilt to reward **curiosity** and **note-taking** rather than brute forcing.",

    "selftext": "To be more specific, Massive Entertainment put out a social media statement implying that they're encouraging staff to voluntarily leave the company/lay themselves off with benefits/company assistance:\n\n\"As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games. To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading 🙌",

    "selftext": "Okay, yes, I'm a fan of VTM: Bloodlines. The visuals, the music, the story with all the hidden stuff, the voice acting... Jeanette and Therese, the haunted house quest, damn it was good.\nThis feeling to be a monster, powerful, free, cover by vice decafance and sensuality..and humour. \n\nSo yeah, I knew VTM: Bloodlines 2 wouldn’t be great but a part of be wish they gat at least the atmosphere, the \" cool\" factor! ...well They dint and it turned out to be a disappointment. I was ready to play something less open-world, more action-driven, without the full open world and multi-gameplay style of the first.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had a little bit of hope... until they showed me the skill sheet and I realized how simple it was. I became... sad.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, it just doesn’t have a soul. It’s boring. The voice acting for every character, including the main one, is dull and lifeless, with no energy or personality. It lacks the sensuality, the vice, the dirtiness that made the first game unforgettable. The game feels too clean, like the studio didn’t want to take any risks. The female Nomad is boring as hell. Fabian the Malkavian is slightly less boring, but still not entertaining. And he’s a freaking Malkavian!\n\nThe controls are stiff, the combat is dull (I chose Tremere, maybe that was a mistake), and the game is full of bugs. The music... well, it’s somewhere? But when it plays, it completely lacks that epic gothic techno vibe from the first game.\n\nThat said, I do like the graphic style. It looks good. There’s something there, something that could make a great game if they knew what to do with it.\n\nI really hope this isn’t the last game of the series. I want a third one, something that lets them finally make a good game. I hope they listen to the community’s feedback and run with it.\n",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone.

However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me.

It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

In battle, you can deploy units alongside you (and give them orders via a tactical pause, if you want), and on a macro level you will seamlessly manage resources, supply lines, capture and defend locations, build structures, and more on a constantly evolving (in real time) strategic map. The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

    "selftext": "**Budget:** $5,000 max all-in. If a 5080 build hits $4,500 or less and still bangs, even better.\n\n**When:** ASAP\n\n**Location:** SoCal\n\n**Vendors:** Prefer Micro Center for a 3-year accidental damage plan. We have 2 kids and a dog, so protection matters.\n\n**Use case:** Daily gaming, streaming, and content creation. This retires my consoles.\n\n**Monitor:** ASUS ROG Swift PG32UCDP at 4K/240\n\n**Network:** 7 Gb fiber. I want 10 GbE on PCIe to fully leverage it. Wired is preferred over Wi-Fi.\n\n**Lifecycle target:** 5 to 7+ years with sane thermals and easy upkeep.\n\n**Aesthetics:** Color-way does not matter. I’m fully aware of the ‘white tax’ and/or ‘RGB tax.’\n\n\n**Hard requirements**\n\t•\tCPU: Ryzen 9800X3D\n\n\t•\tMotherboard: X870E (or better)\n\n\t•\tGPU: RTX 5080\n\n\t•\tNIC: 10 GbE via PCIe or onboard\n\n\t•\tTarget: Cool and quiet single-PC streaming with NVENC and stable 4K high refresh\n\n\n**Nice to have**\n\t•\tRAM: 64 GB DDR5-6000 low latency\n\n\t•\tStorage: Fast OS and scratch drive plus large game drive. Open to Gen5 for OS and Gen4 for games.\n\n\t•\tCase: Strong thermals, easy build, good dust filters\n\n\t•\tCooling: Quiet under sustained loads. Open to AIO or premium air\n\n\t•\tI/O: Front USB-C, plenty of rear USB, backup Wi-Fi\n\n\n**Games I play and will stream:**\n\nArc Raiders, Cyberpunk 2077, Halo, Battlefield 6, RDR2, GTA V, Helldivers, Minecraft, COD, Star Wars titles. No VR. No Racing. Xbox Ultimate games as well. \n\n\n**My humble request from the sub:**\n\n\t1.\tBest X870E or better board for 9800X3D stability, PCIe layout for a 5080, and room for a 10 GbE card\n\n\t2.\tAIO vs premium air for sustained loads and low noise while streaming\n\n\t3.\tSmart NVMe split for OS and scratch vs games\n\n\t4.\tCase picks that keep a 5080 cool without sounding like a hair dryer\n\n\t5.\tAny cabling or VRR quirks with PG32UCDP at 4K/240 on a 5080\n\n\n**Context + last details:**\n\nI learned my lesson with a prebuilt and I am going from scratch now. Goal is a 5 to 7+ year life cycle with sane thermals and easy upkeep. Thanks for helping me dial this in. \n\nEdit: Yes, I used ChatGPT to clean my drafts up and assist me in formatting/structuring this some since I’m half asleep on my cell phone.\n\n#TYSMIA!",

Nobody is gonna buy a new pc just for win 11 (or very few ppl will do), and majority of windows 10 users are not tech savvy and they will probably continue to use windows 10, which in few months will be a huge security risk and a concern which ms is willingly not looking at for profit.\n\nyes u can extend the security updates for a year but no one has 1000 ms reward points nor anyone one will pay 30 bucks for it.\n\nms ended the support probably to force small and major corporations to upgrade their pcs to win 11 as they generally avoid upgrading to win 11 for stability issues. small corps may not have the budget to spend 30 bucks per pcs (forcing them to upgrade to w11 for free)\n\nand for last no one will switch to linux even if it could be better for those who use their pcs for watching videos and checking emails, as they think terminal is quite difficult to use for regular users.\n\ni think ms should have just ended the support on 2027 or even '28.\n\nyea just sharing my thoughts.",

After disconnecting the ssd it booted Right up to the BIOS so i thought maybe a virus or something. Extracted the SSD put it in my PC to Read it and Even there it takes 10 Minutes to recognize and partially freezes my Explorer . I could extract all data (20GB) over one whole day and now i cleaned over diskpart and still have the Same Slow read and Write speeds (0kbs(freezing) to 6mbs) also slow recognition.\n\nI am Not new to Building pc‘s / repairing Laptops but I Never saw a failing ssd in my whole life. As this one only has 70 Hours uptime and 4 TB written it made me Even more curious how such thing can Happen.\n\nThe off Center WD Label on the ssd made me thing that it made could be a fake ssd. Maybe someone could clarify.\n\nAny idea on why and help to Save this ssd is Welcome!",

This dark thing comes around the corners and slowing creeps up the entire screen and fades out, Everything seems to be frozen it happens and im required to force shutdown the system.\n\nToday when the this again came up and and i force restarted the system there seems to be a faint afterimage (pic3). So i took it to the service centre but by the time i took it there the problem seems to have fixed, they told me it would be software issue and told me to take a video next time it happens.\n\nI had replaced my display from this place one month back, so im kind of not convinced by their explanation.  \nNow the display is fine. Also the thermals seems to be fine, and i wasnt doing anything major to work it either.",

Turns out, MSI Afterburner shows regular, noticeable spikes in CPU temp that don't seem to always correlate to CPU usage. All my other charts (GPU, etc.) are fine. I've cleaned out my case/fans, scanned for malware/viruses/etc., and watched my resource monitor while closing any program that may be the culprit, nothing has stopped these temp spikes. Closing all nonessential programs has made the temperature trend lower, but the spikes still happen.\n\nIt could be that I need something like a new fan and/or application of thermal paste, which sucks because I have zero dollars right now, but the rhythmic regularity of it, and how sudden the temperature spikes always are, makes me think the answer could still be software or firmware related. I've also played with power management settings, which again can change the overall trend higher and lower, but the spikes still happen.\n\nI'm still on Windows 10, but this has been happening since before the support cutoff. It also doesn't help that I cannot find an example online of a temp chart like this on a healthy CPU - when I search \"cpu temperature graph\" it's just pages and pages of videos describing how to show temperature number overlays in video games.\n\nDoes anybody have any idea what this might be?\n\nEDIT: My BIOS shows a CPU temperature graph, and it was not spiking at all. Idling at 60C, which is still higher than I want, but the temperature spikes were completely gone. This makes me think this \\*has\\* to be a sofware issue somehow.",

    "selftext": "Sorry if this isn't tagged properly. I didn't know whether to tag this as \"Question\" or \"Tech Support\" but figured \"Question\" would fit better\n\nAnyway, I'm tired of Microsoft's shit. I've heard W11 has a lot of bloatware, spyware, and is a gen AI nightmare, although I'm unsure how true that is now, since most of the complaints I saw were around the time W11 first released. I don't love W10, but it sounds better than what I've heard about W11. However, I'm very concerned about support for W10 ending earlier this month, mainly for security reasons, so I'm considering either upgrading to W11 or switching to Linux. I know next to nothing about Linux, besides the existence of a couple of distros, but I have heard it usually has little to no bloatware, spyware, and is much more customizable than other OS's. However, I've also heard Linux isn't the best for PC gaming compared to Windows, unless you're willing to troubleshoot way more frequently, but I haven't properly researched this at all. The posts I saw were from 1-2 years and were anecdotes, so I can see the info being false and/or outdated\n\nAnyway, feel free to ask any related questions, and I'll answer to the best of my ability. Some resources, especially wikis or master posts, to learn more about W11 and Linux would also be highly appreciated so I could do my own research\n\nSpecs:\n\n\\- PC: Alienware m15 R3 Laptop\n\n\\- Bought: November 2020 (I want to upgrade to a mid-tier gaming desktop, but I can't afford to atm)\n\n\\- CPU: Core i9-10980HK\n\n\\- GPU: RTX 2070 Super with 8 GB VRAM\n\n\\- RAM: 32 GB\n\n\\- Storage: 1 TB SSD + 500 GB SSD I never use",

All my drivers are up to date and there shouldn't be any thermal throttling. Whenever I play any other games there isn't an issue with my load dropping at all and my clock speeds stay high and consistent.

    "subreddit": "pcmasterrace",
    "title": "The state of Linux for gaming and general use from a Linux veteran's perspective",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nEvery day I see some really weird takes about Linux being upvoted to high heavens that simply are half-truths at best, outright false at worst which makes me believe there's a lack of knowledge about what Linux is and how a modern Linux environment operates, so I'm writing this to give you some insight about the actual state of things.\n\nFirst and foremost, basic Linux terminology. Linux is a group of operative systems (software that communicates with your hardware such as Windows and macOS) mainly spread into three big categories, with many smaller (and bigger in the case of Ubuntu being based on Debian) ones that are edits of the big ones. these are:\n\nDebian (with Ubuntu being a famous derivative), Arch and Fedora. there are ***many*** other options out there and Linux enthusiasts will argue hard for why their weapon of choice is really the best one, but that's where we stand in general.\n\n# Why not Linux?\n\nLet's just get this out of the way at first - Linux is ***not*** flawless or in ***any way shape or form*** or better than Windows If you like the way Microsoft does things with Windows and want the broadest software compatibility (read: everything works) on the market. Using Linux is ***mainly*** a painless experience, but only if you use Linux in suppported use cases. Most of the pain about Linux I read are people that break their own systems doing things they don't understand nor do they know how to recover even though Linux has a very handy snapshot feature that allows you to recover to a previous state just like Windows.\n\nThere's also a current major pain point in the Linux world regarding a transition from X11 to Wayland as a display server protocol (the way you show stuff on your screen, simplified).\n\n**So how does Linux run all of this Windows software if devs aren't making Linux versions?**\n\nOn Linux you quite simply (but extremely technically complex in execution) pretend you're Windows by wrapping software calls into software such as Proton that in turn in based on Wine, or you use Wine directly. The program thinks it is running on Windows and is thus happy to do its thing, and as a result it just works.\n\nThe completely unsupported use cases are primarily the inability to run software with kernel level anticheat (League of Legends, Valorant, Fortnite, Battlefield 6, Call of Duty, Apex Legends) but there's also issues with fringe hardware such as some racing wheels as an example and hardware software such as iCUE that relies on third party implementations instead.\n\nFringe software does ***not*** include most brand name printers on the market, this problem has been solved and continues to be solved by simply installing the printer driver just like you would on Windows if that driver doesn't come prebundled. The main issue here is that Windows often installs a lot of stuff \"in case you need it\", Linux is sometimes doing the same, but more often than not expects you to install things you need, rather than assume you need 90 different printer drivers even though you don't own a printer.\n\nNow if that's not the biggest of issues for you, or you're willing to dual boot (run Linux and Windows on the same machine) whenever that two week long CoD binge strikes you, or finally just want to know more about Linux read on.\n\n# I thought Linux was all terminal to do anything?\n\nOftentimes in this sub I see people going \"well to get anything done you have to enter weird commands\", and while that is true for some enthusiast linux dists (such as arch) Linux is a well polished product of many decades and have simple easy to use UI:s that are simple enough for your granny to use - really! And if you do run into very peculiar problems (happens to the best of us) well, yeah the terminal is the main weapon of choice, but let us not pretend like modifying the registry on Windows with regedit is a simple easy to understand process either.\n\n**So if Linux isn't all terminal, what does it look like?**\n\nOne of the strengths of Linux is that you really get to choose how Linux looks like, but there's a couple of major default looks to Linux: [Cinnamon](https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/cinnamon.png), [GNOME](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cAFmNr18Yxc/maxresdefault.jpg) and [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.22.0/plasma.png) but also stuff like XFCE, LXTq... list is long.\n\nThere's also major support for extremely custom crazy looking desktops like you find over in r/unixporn  such as [1](https://preview.redd.it/rectangle-i-really-really-like-e-ink-v0-9bbh1hx9xnke1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=51a7140cfe6b18e16938beafc25fffbcc77906b1), [2](https://preview.redd.it/herbstluftwm-my-functional-sleek-elegant-stylish-nice-v0-32a0pm56bekf1.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d8bcad6909fdedda0df3af970abb9e489c01240d) and [3](https://preview.redd.it/hyprland-second-linux-rice-v0-6xky6m2kaymf1.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e1aedc4c101a2893759369b43de6f61aea2a7f70). All these examples rely on keyboard-first workflows, so if you're not a person that presses Windows + E to open Explorer, do not fret - there's plenty of things for people that prefer clicking too.\n\n**OK so it kinda looks like Windows, but how do I download software if I can't run exe installers I find on the web?!**\n\nThe main way to download software on Linux is actually through application repositories or as you might know them app stores. That's right, the thing that you use on your phone is how you (primarily) download software on Linux.\n\n# But installing Linux is super hard, right? That has to be all terminal?\n\nWhile some dists pride themselves in doing almost completely manual installations (looking at you Arch) as a rite of passage most dists have simple to use installers (Arch derivative CachyOS does, as an example) complete with nice banner graphics and a step by step process where you enter your wifi password and then you're simply done. If you've never installed a OS before such as the OS came preinstalled on your computer or someone did it for you - an installer [looks a bit like this.](https://ubuntucommunity.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/29ec0f5c3d8c5b51f7b7440c4e2a95cc9f4a0118.png)\n\n# Ok so... why Linux?\n\n1. Many linux dists use vastly less resources than Windows because they don't preinstall things you don't necessarily need - if you need it you install it. Windows assumes you might need things, and installs it before hand just in case. This leads to a scenario where say a fresh Arch install can be using around 400 MB or less of RAM, whereas Windows typically clocks in at 3 GB right out of the box. On top of that as there's not a whole lot of software running once again just in case, Arch is snappier - this is subjective, you don't necessarily need snappy once you've launched a game and you're playing it and you don't necessarily need 2 GB of extra RAM either.\n\n2. If you're a person that greatly enjoys clicking on things and just want things to run, I really don't recommend Linux. Windows is the reigning champion in the \"click shortcut, run game\" sphere.\n\nBut if you're opposed to the way Microsoft does business (such as forcing AI and telemetrics on you) now is a good time to get your toes wet and seeing what's over the proverbial hedge.\n\n3. You want to be able to customise your computer experience in a way that suits you (once again, r/unixporn) with virtually unlimited freedom to do amazing (and stupid) things.\n\nAll in all, I hope I have helped to dispel some of the common misconceptions about Linux being a \"computer nerd\"-only affair and showing you that unless you go crazy with it, it is really just like using Windows but with a slightly different look (and a working app store).",

It is still enabled in the settings, but it does not have any effect, wich I can see visually and through the NVIDIA Overlay, because the FPS doesnt increase, i just have the Base FPS and Base Performance.\n\nI have a Ryzen 5 7500F and a RTX 5070 on Windows 11 Home. I tried enabling DLSS, disabling DLSS, enabling DLAA, enabling FSR or TSR or XeSS, or switching betwenn DLSS modes like performance and such with no effect, only the Base Performance is there. I also tried enabling and disabling NVIDIA Reflex, didnt help.\n\nI also tried deleting the DLSS and Shader Cache of NVIDIA in DXCache and GLCache, replacing the nvngx\\_dlss.dll in the game folder with the newest from [https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-dlss-dll](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-dlss-dll), restarting both the game and windows a ton, deactivating and activating Hardware Accelerated GPU Planning with Restarts everytime and deinstalling all NVIDIA Drivers with DDU and then reinstalling them, all of these did not help.\n\nI did not try today, but back when i had the same Problem with Expedition 33 to use DLSS Override, wich did not help either. The problem occured in Total in Hitman 3, Expedition 33, Control and STalker 2, so i dont think its a Problem of the DLSS implementation. Eventually, in Expedition 33 howewer, i enabled it and it seemed to work again, but i have no reliable way to replicate that.\n\nI dont know if related, but Framegen seems to work.\n\nI am really desperate because this is not a single case but in every game i try enabling DLSS, i hope someone can help!\n\n  \n",

    "title": "The state of Linux for gaming and general use from a Linux veteran's perspective",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nEvery day I see some really weird takes about Linux being upvoted to high heavens that simply are half-truths at best, outright false at worst which makes me believe there's a lack of knowledge about what Linux is and how a modern Linux environment operates, so I'm writing this to give you some insight about the actual state of things.\n\nFirst and foremost, basic Linux terminology. Linux is a group of operative systems (software that communicates with your hardware such as Windows and macOS) mainly spread into three big categories, with many smaller (and bigger in the case of Ubuntu being based on Debian) ones that are edits of the big ones. these are:\n\nDebian (with Ubuntu being a famous derivative), Arch and Fedora. there are ***many*** other options out there and Linux enthusiasts will argue hard for why their weapon of choice is really the best one, but that's where we stand in general.\n\n# Why not Linux?\n\nLet's just get this out of the way at first - Linux is ***not*** flawless or in ***any way shape or form*** or better than Windows If you like the way Microsoft does things with Windows and want the broadest software compatibility (read: everything works) on the market. Using Linux is ***mainly*** a painless experience, but only if you use Linux in suppported use cases. Most of the pain about Linux I read are people that break their own systems doing things they don't understand nor do they know how to recover even though Linux has a very handy snapshot feature that allows you to recover to a previous state just like Windows.\n\nThere's also a current major pain point in the Linux world regarding a transition from X11 to Wayland as a display server protocol (the way you show stuff on your screen, simplified).\n\n**So how does Linux run all of this Windows software if devs aren't making Linux versions?**\n\nOn Linux you quite simply (but extremely technically complex in execution) pretend you're Windows by wrapping software calls into software such as Proton that in turn in based on Wine, or you use Wine directly. The program thinks it is running on Windows and is thus happy to do its thing, and as a result it just works.\n\nThe completely unsupported use cases are primarily the inability to run software with kernel level anticheat (League of Legends, Valorant, Fortnite, Battlefield 6, Call of Duty, Apex Legends) but there's also issues with fringe hardware such as some racing wheels as an example and hardware software such as iCUE that relies on third party implementations instead.\n\nFringe software does ***not*** include most brand name printers on the market, this problem has been solved and continues to be solved by simply installing the printer driver just like you would on Windows if that driver doesn't come prebundled. The main issue here is that Windows often installs a lot of stuff \"in case you need it\", Linux is sometimes doing the same, but more often than not expects you to install things you need, rather than assume you need 90 different printer drivers even though you don't own a printer.\n\nNow if that's not the biggest of issues for you, or you're willing to dual boot (run Linux and Windows on the same machine) whenever that two week long CoD binge strikes you, or finally just want to know more about Linux read on.\n\n# I thought Linux was all terminal to do anything?\n\nOftentimes in this sub I see people going \"well to get anything done you have to enter weird commands\", and while that is true for some enthusiast linux dists (such as arch) Linux is a well polished product of many decades and have simple easy to use UI:s that are simple enough for your granny to use - really! And if you do run into very peculiar problems (happens to the best of us) well, yeah the terminal is the main weapon of choice, but let us not pretend like modifying the registry on Windows with regedit is a simple easy to understand process either.\n\n**So if Linux isn't all terminal, what does it look like?**\n\nOne of the strengths of Linux is that you really get to choose how Linux looks like, but there's a couple of major default looks to Linux: [Cinnamon](https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/cinnamon.png), [GNOME](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cAFmNr18Yxc/maxresdefault.jpg) and [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.22.0/plasma.png) but also stuff like XFCE, LXTq... list is long.\n\nThere's also major support for extremely custom crazy looking desktops like you find over in r/unixporn  such as [1](https://preview.redd.it/rectangle-i-really-really-like-e-ink-v0-9bbh1hx9xnke1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=51a7140cfe6b18e16938beafc25fffbcc77906b1), [2](https://preview.redd.it/herbstluftwm-my-functional-sleek-elegant-stylish-nice-v0-32a0pm56bekf1.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d8bcad6909fdedda0df3af970abb9e489c01240d) and [3](https://preview.redd.it/hyprland-second-linux-rice-v0-6xky6m2kaymf1.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e1aedc4c101a2893759369b43de6f61aea2a7f70). All these examples rely on keyboard-first workflows, so if you're not a person that presses Windows + E to open Explorer, do not fret - there's plenty of things for people that prefer clicking too.\n\n**OK so it kinda looks like Windows, but how do I download software if I can't run exe installers I find on the web?!**\n\nThe main way to download software on Linux is actually through application repositories or as you might know them app stores. That's right, the thing that you use on your phone is how you (primarily) download software on Linux.\n\n# But installing Linux is super hard, right? That has to be all terminal?\n\nWhile some dists pride themselves in doing almost completely manual installations (looking at you Arch) as a rite of passage most dists have simple to use installers (Arch derivative CachyOS does, as an example) complete with nice banner graphics and a step by step process where you enter your wifi password and then you're simply done. If you've never installed a OS before such as the OS came preinstalled on your computer or someone did it for you - an installer [looks a bit like this.](https://ubuntucommunity.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/29ec0f5c3d8c5b51f7b7440c4e2a95cc9f4a0118.png)\n\n# Ok so... why Linux?\n\n1. Many linux dists use vastly less resources than Windows because they don't preinstall things you don't necessarily need - if you need it you install it. Windows assumes you might need things, and installs it before hand just in case. This leads to a scenario where say a fresh Arch install can be using around 400 MB or less of RAM, whereas Windows typically clocks in at 3 GB right out of the box. On top of that as there's not a whole lot of software running once again just in case, Arch is snappier - this is subjective, you don't necessarily need snappy once you've launched a game and you're playing it and you don't necessarily need 2 GB of extra RAM either.\n\n2. If you're a person that greatly enjoys clicking on things and just want things to run, I really don't recommend Linux. Windows is the reigning champion in the \"click shortcut, run game\" sphere.\n\nBut if you're opposed to the way Microsoft does business (such as forcing AI and telemetrics on you) now is a good time to get your toes wet and seeing what's over the proverbial hedge.\n\n3. You want to be able to customise your computer experience in a way that suits you (once again, r/unixporn) with virtually unlimited freedom to do amazing (and stupid) things.\n\nAll in all, I hope I have helped to dispel some of the common misconceptions about Linux being a \"computer nerd\"-only affair and showing you that unless you go crazy with it, it is really just like using Windows but with a slightly different look (and a working app store).",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Replacing Gtx1080ti\nNeed: More than 30FPS on 32\" QHD monitor. Want: Longevity, Future-proofing\nHave: Recently Upgraded PC - MB, CPU, RAM. Budget: 650USD (flexible)\nQueries: AMD/Nvidia? 2nd-Hand/New/Brand New?\n\nLooking for some advice on upgrading my old and tired GTX 1080 Ti 11GB. I've had it for nearly 8 years and it's finally giving up the ghost (can only get 30FPS on Borderlands 4, unless I downscale). I'm aware that anything I buy will be a significant improvement over my 1080Ti potato.\n\nHere are my PC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7600X\nMB: Gigabyte B650M PCIe 4.0 x16 Motherboard\nRAM: 32GB 5600MHz DDR5\nDISPLAY: 32\" 1440p (QHD) Curved Monitor\nPSU: Corsair 750W\nGPU: NVIDIA 1080TI 11GB \n\nThese seem to be my upgrade options:\n\n1) Buy a second-hand 3070 or 3080 (or Ti) - High risk, low cost - 5 years old already, no warranty, power hungry and warm, mining risk - I'm already asking around mates who have upgraded recently themselves.\n\n2) Buy a 5070 or 5070Ti - Price has decreased recently, has a warranty, mixed reviews online, cooler than 3080s (it gets hot in Australia) - some second hand options are available with a  warranty.\n\n3) Buy a brand new RTX 6000 series - concerned about power requirements and potential bottlenecks (PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0), high cost - seems overkill? \n\n4) Consider an AMD alternative - 9060 or 7800 XT? - Lower cost, has warranty, higher VRAM/longevity - I've been impressed with my AMD CPU after being a long time Intel fan boy, but not sure about their GPUs. I heard the loss of Raytracing and DLSS is a huge hit, despite the price difference.\n\nMy Priorities:\n\nLongevity - can I find a replacement that I can get away with another 5+ years? I've heard more VRAM is probably a better idea long term - trying to avoid the need for Mobo (PCIe 4) and PSU (700W) replacement.\n\nMid-range-ish - I'm not looking for amazing, top of the line, blow your face off, graphics. I don't mind running some games on medium, so long as I can play them on my QHD monitor  seamlessly, without obvious visual lag. \n\nGames - I mostly play Borderlands, Sea of Thieves and some Xbox Gamepass games. I don't really play any fast shooters, AAA or intensive games like GTA, BF6, COD or CS.\n\nBudget - I'd ideally like to spend less than $1000 AUD (650 USD), but if waiting a little longer and buying better is worthwhile then perfect, as I'm not in a huge rush - Black Friday Sales are coming up soon.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the wall of text. I look forward to any advice and recommendations you can give :D",

    "selftext": "I've been trying to work through this problem for days, and I hope somebody can help me.\n\nI noticed that my CPU fan (Ryzen 7 3800X) keeps getting real loud and obnoxious every few seconds, even when idling. Turns out, MSI Afterburner shows regular, noticeable spikes in CPU temp that don't seem to always correlate to CPU usage. All my other charts (GPU, etc.) are fine. I've cleaned out my case/fans, scanned for malware/viruses/etc., and watched my resource monitor while closing any program that may be the culprit, nothing has stopped these temp spikes. Closing all nonessential programs has made the temperature trend lower, but the spikes still happen.\n\nIt could be that I need something like a new fan and/or application of thermal paste, which sucks because I have zero dollars right now, but the rhythmic regularity of it, and how sudden the temperature spikes always are, makes me think the answer could still be software or firmware related. I've also played with power management settings, which again can change the overall trend higher and lower, but the spikes still happen.\n\nI'm still on Windows 10, but this has been happening since before the support cutoff. It also doesn't help that I cannot find an example online of a temp chart like this on a healthy CPU - when I search \"cpu temperature graph\" it's just pages and pages of videos describing how to show temperature number overlays in video games.\n\nDoes anybody have any idea what this might be?\n\nEDIT: My BIOS shows a CPU temperature graph, and it was not spiking at all. Idling at 60C, which is still higher than I want, but the temperature spikes were completely gone. This makes me think this \\*has\\* to be a sofware issue somehow.",

They replaced the motherboard, and I bought a brand new PSU (Gigabyte P450B) as well because before that, I used a cheap casing-free PSU -,-.\n\nAfter 6 months, one day when I turned on the wall switch, I got an electric shock, and our strip breaker tripped. Then I took it to the shop, and they gave me a brand new PSU. Everything was normal and okay after that.\n\nAfter 4–5 months, I got the same freeze problem again. I took it to the shop, and they said maybe it’s a GPU problem. They told me they ran the PC without the GPU, and it was running normally. Then I took it back, but the same issue happened again, even without the GPU.\n\nNow it freezes, and the display goes black, then shows Windows again, looping continuously.

I've made some upgrades based on suggestions + you can all see the full picture of my space I've been talking about (ie where the podcaster is now + mics etc and other side of the wall)\n\n**Check pictures here:** [**WIDE VIEW**](https://freeimage.host/i/pxl-20251025-011046826mp.Kr7j1zg) **|** [**CLOSE VIEW**](https://freeimage.host/i/pxl-20251025-011325535mp.Kr7kK9p)\n\n1. Added riser under monitor\n2. Added keybo/mouse pad (my old one, ordered new one to test)\n3. Added a power shelf under the table on the right\n4. FIXED the monitor tilt, more cable management, tucked computer away behind bar\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n1. Waiting on new shelf and plants.\n2. Ordered a pegboard as well for charging station\n3. New larger grey scale mouse pad\n4. Headphones modern stand coming in Monday\n\nThank you all for the recommendations and trolling :P was fun!  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Original Post  \nFinally got around revamping my work station.\n\n* Used the [74\" IKEA Kitchen KIRBY Walnut Veneer Table Top](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/karlby-countertop-for-kitchen-island-walnut-veneer-30297641/#content)\n* Got a welder to custom build legs for me\n* Bought square leg risers to add some height + have padding on the bottom of the feet.\n* Added LED lights from Temu\n* Cable management under the monitor area via Amazon\n* Monitor arm from Amazon as well\n* Yamaha HS7 Monitor + Amazon Stands (I wish the stands were shorter but the smaller ones couldn't handle the weight)\n\nMy computer is tucked in the back under, it doesnt stick out...just an early picture ( I built without lights for the first time thinking I wouldn't care lol, wish I got a sick case, but oh well)\n\nWaiting for blackfriday to get a new chair as the current one is too old.\n\nI wanted to add shelving so I bought one but not sure where to add it lol. The left of the table is a window in the basement that throws off the whole look. I will upload an updated picture but thought I would post this to get some feedback in the meantime!",

It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can’t say I’m surprised — but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it’s a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn’t realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything’s dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

FIXED the monitor tilt, more cable management, tucked computer away behind bar\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n1. Waiting on new shelf and plants.\n2. Ordered a pegboard as well for charging station\n3. New larger grey scale mouse pad\n4.

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing “thudding”. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I’ve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to “thud”. \n\nI’ve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and “thudding” from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

This is my TVK Minivan 40% keyboard. I built it back in 2019-2020 primarily for taking notes in classes at uni. I have Zeal PC Zilent V2 62 gram silent tactile switches which helps to keep the noise down. The case I use is a Ltgem stethoscope case recommended to me by another redditor many years ago when I first built it.\n\n\nAs for what I bring with it, I bring a little USB wireless mouse to use with my Steam Deck, USB cables for my phone, Steam Deck, laptop and iPad with adapters/hubs for all. It is a great setup to have in such a small case/package! This and my Steam Deck is a whole portable gaming setup or this and my laptop is a full productivity setup! \n\n\nNext I'd like to see how you take your keebs to work or school or travel! What accessories do you bring? What type of cases do you use?",

    "selftext": "My first mechanical keyboard was an aluminum NK65 into which I popped Zilents, but it soon became a closet board (and then I left it at my childhood home for when I visit the ‘rents and work from here). Since I’ve bought a couple ai03 boards, a Neo Ergo, a Rama U-80B, a couple Jacky Hippos, and the Classic TKL. The latter most really shocked me with how good it felt and sounded at the price point. I also stocked up on Gateron Oil Kings because of all the praise and was really shocked at how great they feel out of the box without added lube.\n\nAnyways, this week I’ve been back home and I’m miserable typing on the NK65. Everything feels and sounds bad. Maybe it’s because I’m a linear man now, and obviously I’m typing on better quality boards at home, but it’s also revelatory to me just how much progress has been made, on switch quality, on stabilizers, on affordable boards. I’m probably going to buy another Classic TKL to leave here and retire/ewaste my old NK alu boards (I have the 80% one also).\n\nCurious if others have found themselves having to type on their first boards from years back and what that experience was like. It has been very very hard for me to revert.",

Overall feels expensive.\n\nBuild quality 10/10 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mpl47f4fowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae90f1ab48f6aab4d5b4eadaf9bd55c81359175d\n\nThe keyboard looks pretty darn well first look, giving off that \"cute aesthetic\" vibe to it (IMHO), I was a bit disappointed because my whole setup is dark/black and the keyboard is standing out between all the dark parts of my PC. I was hoping for the black edition but was out of stock so it's understandable.\n\nI been using 60% and 75% keyboards for 3 years now and overall this big keyboard felt a bit weird at first but then became second nature after 1 or 2 hours. Not to mention it feels smooth to type (using it to type this post RN lol) and it's not that loud, has that \"THOCK\" sound that some are never endlessly looking for.\n\nThe RGB feels okay, wish it was more \"shine through\" (this could be fixed with some shine through keycaps) and it feels okay, have not set it up that much but overall I like it, not intrusive like others.\n\nLooks and feel: 9.5/10\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn8a2p8vfowf1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c0d3fe5999a988e455883a0f382b130c05a124\n\n  \nThis keyboard has a TON of features, starting with the little screen \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wflohgblowf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4432d2d43d32bcbeff9208a1c4ca89358224d92d\n\nFully customizable and guess what? You don't need an additional driver/software on your PC for yet another keyboard, this one can be used via browser (I think only on Google Chrome) but that's a FANTASTIC advantage, you can use it on Linux and Mac without sacrificing the software or customization of the keys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yps8hhyklowf1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fbd0e74884beee989f1b7b101b883bf279171b9\n\nKudos to Chiikey for this, this is a fantastic feature and something to praise, also it was incredibly easy to just post a gif to the little screen instead of having to cut the gif into multiple images and upload them all like other keyboards\n\nSoftware/Drivers 11/10\n\nAs for the unboxing process it was pretty standard and actually a bit disappointing to be honest.\n\nFor starters you do not get any fancy tools to remove the keycaps or the mechanical switches itself, still no clear indication if it's hot swappable 3 or 5 pins (still yet to tear it down, wanted to test it out of the box with no modifications or me removing parts of it) it IS hot swappable but there's no really a lot of transparency of how many pins or what switches are supported.\n\nYou don't get any additional switches unlike other keyboards (some only bring 3 but at least they bring them unlike this one) there's the tab for the compartment where you can store things and also you get some screws, some plastic... tabs? and a little black thing that I am yet to recognize at the time of writing.\n\nAnd of course, you get a USB cable to charge or connect your keyboard, type C so no worries there.\n\nThe USB dongle is inside the keyboard on the bottom part hidden in a tiny\n\nThe packaging was impeccable, very beautiful box and the keyboard was very well wrapped and protected, no dents or scratches and it wasn't all over the place, all neatly packaged in a big rectangular box.\n\nUnboxing and contents: 5/10 \n\nAs mentioned before the switches on this keyboard make a very satisfying \"THOCK\" \"THOCK\" sound, it's not clear if this is lubed but it really feels good, really really good, not that loud too just \"right\"\n\nIt doesn't strain my hands as far as I tested it (around 5 or 6 hours in total, more than enough for someone who works at an office and is constantly typing non stop, even now typing this review lol)\n\nMy only complaint is that no matter what I did, the knob click behaviour never changed when I changed it in the software, it always defaults to \"mute\" instead of \"pause\" or play.\n\nTyping experience 8.5/10\n\nTotal score: 10 + 9.5 + 11 + 5 + 8.5 / 5 = 8.8/10 \n\nPersonal score being honest would be more of a 9/10, it's a pretty darn good keyboard and worth every penny, my only grip is the lack of switches or tools to customize the keyboard to your heart's content and the color, really wish it could have been the dark colored version but that's something I will learn to live with.\n\nCheers!",

This board beautifully mimics the iconic vintage IBM Model M SSK aesthetic but with modern improvements. For the quietest typing experience in my office, I chose Cherry silent red switches, and they're even quieter than the ones in my old Vortex Race 3. The Cherry profile keycaps create an excellent typing angle that allows my fingers to naturally curve over the top rows, making long typing sessions comfortable without needing a wrist rest which is big yes for me. My preference for the Vortex Model M over the Unicomp Model M comes down to one key feature: hotswap. This allows me to easily use silent switches, like the Cherry silent reds, which are better suited for my office environment.\n\n",

    "selftext": "After almost a decade, I’ve been slowly getting soured by the keyboard hobby earlier in this year cos of a lot of factors like some vendors disappearing after taking our money. And not finding anything interesting to try out… “I already have something similar, why bother” - mentality. I also don’t really have irl friends that are into keebs lol. I was also getting disheartened by vendors  (Bolsa, PrimeKB, AshKeebs, Mintlodica) and personalities (TaehaTyped, 3ildCat, Minterly, Shoobs) choosing to step away from the hobby/focus on other things… like, should I step away as well?\n\nI’ve never been to a meetup. I should at least experience one so I decided to fly across the country for The Keyboard Meetup ’25.\n\n10/10 experience, would recommend. Seeing and getting to try stuff was an experience. I got to ask vendors about their upcoming products, I guess I found things not similar to anything I have yet lol, specially as a Topre/EC enjoyer. Also got to meet designers and content creators! But the social aspect of the meet-up is what made it for me. It’s  really fun and great to talk to other people about each other’s builds and their journey through this rabbithole. \n\nI was able to share my experience missing out on a beige or yellow NK87, reaching out to NK, getting told by NK customer support that there wasn’t any plans to restock them (but to be patient cos they had a TKL they were working on), and finally getting and loving the Classic TKL. I even got to meet THE person from NK who responded to me!\n\nIt was awsome to get some advice on how to go about getting a plate for my own Sho66 from others with the same board. If you haven’t been to a meetup, you should give it a try or set one up yourself (not me tho, I’m bad at planning).\n\nThanks NK_ and all the vendors and guests who made it happen. This was an experience that reminded me how great this hobby is and made me realize how much I was missing out by not engaging with this awesome community for years.",

    "title": "Tex Shinobi - mini-review",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/osqvzf04zpwf1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934d86fd6b2611ac9c1986eb8209ea86c09bf7b4\n\nA quick mini-review from a beginners experience -\n\nI did quite a bit of research before purchasing my new Tex Shinobi keyboard. I thought I'd list out a few points that weren't clear to me prior to purchase for potential future purchasers who know that reddit is perhaps the only place left on the internet to find somewhat honest opinions...\n\n\\* DIY board installation - The DIY kit does not need any soldering. This isn't really clear to the beginner, especially as the info on their site states -\n\n1. All switches need to be soldered ( soldering type )\n\n....which is simply not true. The kit allows the use of any cherry MX 'style' switches to be used, and I opted to use KTT Matcha switches which were a piece of cake to install. Installation of the switches, along with the case assembly was very straightforward and took about 45minutes from beginning to end. It was a really straightforward experience with no soldering required. The term 'Hot-Swap' is used elsewhere in the Tex product description, and I suspect for the initiated that's all that's required to know that no soldering is needed.\n\n\\* BLE adapter - works really well, and feels completely lag free for both typing and trackpoint use. I'm glad I purchased it. I wasn't initially fussed, but one less cable on the desk is a good thing. One thing that isn't clear is that it simply does not work without upgrading the firmware - which is a very easy process that involves running a downloadable executable with the keyboard usb cabled up. It takes 2 x AA batters rather than being a rechargeable module - this is both a plus and negative IMO.\n\n\\* Build quality - very good. It feels very solid and the 'main fame' -  where the key switches and pcb attach -appears to be made of steel. This gives it a very solid feel - along with a bit of weight. All plastics seem like they are of a good quality, but don't scream premium - they feel perfectly acceptable instead - i.e. not cheap, but somewhere in the middle. The battery compartment of the BLE adapter is something I could have a minor niggle about, but it's fine really - but it does feel a little cheap IMO, but you never need to look at it, and batteries will last \\~3months apparently.\n\n\\* Trackpoint - amazing. This is why I purchased it. I stopped using mice 25 years ago, when I first received a thinkpad for work. I've been a committed trackpoint user ever since, either via thinkpad laptops or lenovo keyboards with built-in trackpoints - I think I've probably owned all the variations of those keyboards. Anyway, when I first turned it on I thought I'd have to fix the sensitivity as it felt super fast. In a nutshell, the default speed is perfect and better than any variation of trackpoint I've used. The acceleration is super fast, but you can quickly slow for super high fidelity movements. Perfect for the modern era with 2 or 3 screen setups! I can write my name eligibly in mspaint to prove it too! The middle buttom for scrolling works great as well. For some reason, this works way better than the usb lenovo keyboards - which are really slow for scrolling when this is used. So yeah, trackpoint is what I wanted and trackpoint++ is what I got! No fiddling required - all defaults are well chosen. Woot! I couldn't be happier in this regard.\n\n\\* Keyboard - excellent. Obviously a combination of the KTT Matcha switches too - which I like. I've not had any unwanted double key inputs, nor missing key presses after a few days of typing. The sound is a little louder than I was hoping, but I guess there are hacks for stuffing noise dampening materials into the case to cover this. I love the layout - it's old school thinkpad baby! The inclusion of a true blue Enter key was the icing on the cake. I love the shape of the keycaps and the quality of plastic used here feels good to me too.\n\nMisc niggles -\n\n\\* Portability - Not very. A bit on the heavier and bulkier side to be practical. I guess there are other Tex options that would be better here, and I already have the lenovo usb thinkpad keyboards for this purpose.\n\n\\* Aesthetics - mostly great, but you can see the keyboard switches on the function row as there is a 2mm gap. This would have been lesser of an issue if the switches I used weren't bright Matcha green. I notice on an older usb lenovo keyboard I have, they have filled the area with a plastic separator. Tex should have probably done the same, but it's a real minor niggle. The BLE adapter looks like a bit of an afterthought, but it's not really visible so no biggie.\n\n...and that's about it. I like it enough to spend 30minutes and another 10minutes making minor edits putting this mini-review together. It's definitely better than I was expecting which is rare these days. Yeah, not cheap, but worth it I reckon.",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "About a year or two ago, I released the [ScottoFrog (Handwired Edition)](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/macropads/scottofrog-handwired-macropad) which is a completely free-to-build 3D printed macropad based on the [Frogpad](http://frogpad.com). It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

    "selftext": "As always, I want to disclose that this was sent to me by Chilkey without any compensation or influence on my words, just simply to see how the community views this board.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n \nThe box design caught my eye with the plastic sleeve over the box that has the perfect suction to increase the anticipation of viewing the product. After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing “thudding”. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I’ve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to “thud”. \n\nI’ve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and “thudding” from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

Used Acco Lavender Purple Switches with Double PBT keycaps from Amazon (Hammerhead Shark, which also includes smaller Space keys which are compatible and a redundant B key). Then Added a nice Escape Key in Chip Design from Ali Express as a cherry on top. Managed by now to add some shortcuts via the Via app for the keys home, end, vol up and vol down, which I absolutely need. Lets see what else could be useful (vi like navigation, maybe intellij shortcuts). Anyway, enjoying my keyboard and happy to present it here :-).",

    "selftext": "\nFirst of all, sorry if I make any grammatical mistakes; I’m not a native English speaker, but I’ll try to explain myself as clearly as possible.\n\nAlright, let me give a bit of context. I’m a computer engineering student, and I have an Asus TUF Gaming F15 with an i7 13620H processor and an NVIDIA 4060 GPU. I use it for programming, studying, watching videos and movies, and playing games (I don’t play many FPS games; I prefer AAA titles and LoL hahaha). Basically, it’s an all-rounder. I know a laptop isn’t the most optimal thing in the world, but it’s very convenient for taking it to class, moving houses, etc.\n\nLately, after spending so many hours in front of the computer, I get tired very quickly, and I can’t spend more than 30 minutes straight programming or studying because with that small 15” screen and a keyboard that isn’t the most comfortable, I end up feeling overwhelmed. I don’t really know how to explain it, but after two years it’s like whenever I have to sit down to program, it feels really exhausting.\n\nSo I thought that to get the best of both a laptop and a desktop, I could set up a workstation at home to use my laptop like a tower PC, with a proper setup including a monitor (I think 1440p is optimal for my F15) and a keyboard (I was thinking of the Razer BlackWidow V3 TKL, but I’m open to suggestions). I’d also like minimal compatibility with the PS5, since I already have one, so I might as well use it.\n\nThe monitor is where I have doubts. I’ve been obsessed for weeks watching reviews, rankings, etc. In the price range I want, >€250, I’ve found two main contenders: the MSI MAG 274QRF-QD E2 and the AOC Q27G3XMN.\n\nI’ve read that the MSI has really good colors and comes highly recommended, but I honestly haven’t found many reviews. I relied a lot on the specs, and there’s no RTINGS review of this E2 model, only the previous one, which they tore apart for its HDR, basically calling it trash hahaha. This one has been seen here in Spain, where I live, for around €230-240, so I suppose during Black Friday it might drop to about €220.\n\nAny suggestion??? Any model that im missing?? \n\n",

I cant go any higher on the refresh rate - if i use e.g. `140`, `144` or `240` it just results in a black screen. \n\nHere's my questions:\n- Why cant i go higher on custom refresh rate - theoretically the display should be able to handle up to 240hz? \n- Would a custom (kernel/software) EDID solve this issue? If so - what are the risks? I'm not overclocking per se (it supports 240hz natively), so it might not be a problem? (I will *not* flash an EDID to the display via IPC, only sideload the EDID on the kernel side).\n\nThanks\n",

    "title": "State of MiniLED monitors",
    "selftext": "So I was recently in the market for a high end gaming+productivity monitor, decided to give miniLED a shot, KTC M27P6 specifically. I have plenty of experience with miniLED from current high end macbooks, so I thought if I could get something similar that would be great. Boy was it not even close. So local dimming ON in normal OS usage and web browsing looks horrific and is completely unusable. Every window thats not with pure black or white background is completely non-uniform with a gigantic darker halo following the cursor. Later I found out that apparently with external miniled monitors you are supposed to run local dimming exclusively for videos and games, and switch it off and have normal IPS mode for the OS. Is that actually the case for every external miniled monitor on the market? Even by legit brands like asus/samsung? You can't even enjoy the benefits of miniled in normal OS use with occasional black background for a website or a picture? I'll give it a bit of credit in terms of looking better than normal IPS in games and videos, and the LD off mode looks like a perfectly fine raw IPS monitor with phenomenal brightness too, I just have a hard time getting behind not being able to \"set and forget\" the monitor settings as well as not being able to use LD on for general OS use. Btw LD auto mode doesn't actually remove the need for manual switching, it just ties it to the hdr, so you have to manually switch HDR. Apple seems to have pulled off local dimming zones being on permanently and looking decent by having 6x the zone density and having a tight controller integration into the frame drawing pipeline. If this is indeed the state of miniled monitors on the market rn, this is just another reason to ditch LCD for oled. Unless I'm missing something?",

Currently running a 6yo 1080p 144hz 24in IPS ASUS TUF monitor. \n\nThe issue I have is that I also WFH c.7-8hrs/ day (outlook, excel, teams, the usual), so feels like I can't really go down the OLED route for risk of burn-in and a reduced work experience. Home office has a lot of unnatural light so assuming glare will be bad too. \n\nSo, I'm thinking something like a 1440p 240hz IPS at around 27inches is probably the best upgrade path, but happy to be convinced otherwise. I probably value frames/smoothness more than 4k though. However l, it feels like the product offering for this is quite low in the UK - I can't seem to find monitors like a Gigabyte M27Q X, the AOC XMN one, or anything really. \n\nSo, I'm wondering if you have any advice? Anyone in a similar boat? Any top choices in Q3 20205 for a WFH/gaming experience? Appreciate any advice or experiences!",

So I thought it’s a good time to upgrade, after doing a lot of research and reading what all you nice people think about different technologies I decided to go for a high refresh rate IPS panel, since I work with colours as part of my job making the colour accuracy useful there as well as the refresh rate for clicking heads in CS and BF6. \n\nI had also seen rave reviews of mini led and how amazing HDR can be, but I was struggling to find a mini led IPS panel, I’ve seen display ninjas reviews of some KTC monitors so was keeping my eye out but all the ones available to me seem to be VA. So when I saw an IPS panel with mini led I jumped the gun and bought it even though I couldn’t find a review and there was no review on DisplayNinja. \n\nSo I bought the KOORUI S2721PM from Amazon (it had good reviews on there) but jumping into bf6 I noticed these dark squares when in bright scenes and looking around. I’ve done my best to capture it on a video on my phone and I think you can see it. I’ve tried it with HDR on windows turned on and off and it still happens. I have tried it in a few different scenarios, for example the video is on operation firestorm on BF6 but on other maps in that game I can’t replicate it. Seems to be fine on Cairo and Liberation Peak in the detailed sections. Also tried it on CS and it doesn’t seem to have an issue with any map on that game.\n\nHas anyone seen this before? Is there anything I can change to stop this from happening? Is this a Mini LED feature or is it this budget mini led monitor at fault? \n\nAny help is appreciated cos I am incredibly lost. TIA\n",

    "selftext": "Doing some research on high refresh rate IPS with wide color gamut, a lot of good options are no longer available but the two Asus options are still available for purchase in the US. GPU is 5090.\n\nInformation are gathered from Asus website, DisplaySpec, and Panelook so may not be 100% accurate...but would appreciate the input if anyone know more about these two monitors\n\n**PG32UQXR:**\n\nUsing AUO M320QAN02.8, panel spec list 99% AdobeRGB, 5ms GTG. Fully aware that it has 50% of the LED zones compared to UQX but that's ok for my use.\n\nHDMI 2.1 and DP 2.1, which is a big plus compared to UGX, however I'm not sure if the DP2.1 on the PG32UQXR is DP40 or DP80. \n\nDisplaySpec states that it can only do 8bit color at 160hz and 8bit+FRC at 120hz, but could not find much information about this else where. I think even at DP40 bandwidth it should be able to do 10bit 120hz so not sure what is the deal with this.\n\n**PG32UQX:**\n\nAlso AUO panel, slightly older revision M320QAN02.6, panel spec shows 12ms GTG, and higher zones and HDR rating.\n\nDP1.4 DSC and HDMI 2.0, but somehow DisplaySpec shows it can do 10bit at 120hz or lower, which doesn't make sense to me from bandwidth perspective given the UQXR have much higher bandwidth with both DP and HDMI.\n\nGsync Ultimate, not sure if the hardware Gsync is worth it, heard it could get annoying since there is a small fan there just to cool the Gsync hardware chip.\n\n  \nGiven that I don't need the best HDR, and don't care much for Gsync Ultimate, I'm leaning toward the UQXR given that it's $300 lower than UQX right now, but the 8bit at 160hz thing is the most puzzling to me",

The model of the monitor is KTC (120hz) and it’s working pretty well but I’m starting to think that something is a bit off. So, since the monitor itself it’s connected with the laptop (60 hz) I was wondering if there will be any impact on the performance since the laptop is 60hz and the monitor is 120hz. Also I’m unable to access the OSD because the monitor doesn’t have arrows on the back and when I try to move into the OSD ( I can open it ) I just can’t, because using the arrows of the laptop just moves the cursor from application to application on my desktop. Is there any way to solve this? The only real issue is that I want to modify some settings in the OSD and I just can’t because of this. Also I wanted to ask: is there something I should check? Something regarding the Hz difference the refresh rate or something else?? Sorry if I’m this stupid but I never used a monitor paired with a laptop (trough HDMI) so I don’t really know what to do.",

Thanks!\n\n  \nEdit answering open questions:\n\n\\- Budget: Nothing fixed, not convinced to spend 1000 a monitor. <500€ ideally  \n\\- use case: Gaming  \n\\- setup: 2 identical monitors, running game on one and netflix/discord/reddit on the other  \n\\- GPU: haven't bought the new system but will be around RTX5080",

    "selftext": "Hi r/Monitors,\n\nI’m having an issue with my Acer G245H and I’m hoping someone here has run into something similar or has ideas.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n\n* When I turn the monitor on, the Acer logo appears for \\~1 second and then the screen goes black.\n* Power LED stays blue, but the OSD menu doesn’t appear, no matter which button I press.\n* HDMI from my GPU registers the monitor in NVIDIA Control Panel, but the image disappears after 2–5 seconds.\n* Connecting HDMI to the motherboard shows “No signal” and the monitor goes into orange standby (expected, since GPU is active).\n* I’ve tried:\n   * New HDMI cables\n   * DVI cable\n   * Hard reset on the monitor (power off, hold power button 30 sec)\n   * Reseated GPU\n   * Updated graphics drivers\n   * Direct power from wall outlet\n* Problem happens with any input (HDMI/DVI/VGA) and with different computers/cables.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Do you have any other ideas or fixes you’ve tried that worked?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Salut la communauté,\n​J'ai une grosse hésitation entre deux moniteurs 4K 160 Hz de MSI et j'espère que vos retours d'expérience sur le double écran pourront m'aider à trancher.\n\n​Mon Contexte :\n\nJe joue pas mal à des jeux solo immersifs (en ce moment, Hogwarts Legacy, donc j'apprécie l'ambiance et les scènes sombres) et aussi à de la simulation automobile. Mon écran principal sera ce 32 pouces, et je l'utiliserai à côté de mon écran secondaire qui est un 27 pouces PLAT et IPS.\n\n​Mes deux finalistes (4K 160 Hz / DisplayHDR 400) :\n\n​MSI MAG 322UPF Écran gaming 32 pouces UHD - dalle Rapid IPS 3840 x 2160, 160 Hz / 1ms GtG, gamut sRGB 125,7 %, design sans cadre, DisplayHDR 400 - DP 1.4a, USB Type-C (DP alt., / PD 90W), HDMI\n​Ma crainte : J'ai peur que l'écran plat soit beaucoup moins immersif pour le jeu que le modèle incurvé.\n\n​MSI MAG 321CUP Écran PC Gaming Incurvé 32\" UHD - Dalle VA 1500, 3840x2160, 160 Hz / 1 ms, 16:9, Adaptive Sync - DisplayPort 1.4a, USB Type-C (DP Alt. avec Power Delivery 15 W), HDMI 2.1 CEC\n\n​Mon Vrai Dilemme :\n\n​Le 321CUP (VA Incurvé) me fait de l'œil pour l'immersion. MAIS : Je crains que le mettre côte à côte avec mon 27\" plat IPS ne soit très moche (décalage physique) et distrayant (incohérence des couleurs/contraste entre le VA et l'IPS).\n​Question simple : Est-ce que le gain d'immersion dans un jeu comme Hogwarts Legacy (avec l'incurvé VA) vaut le sacrifice de l'harmonie et de l'ergonomie de mon bureau (avec le 27\" plat IPS à côté) ?\n​Merci pour vos conseils avisés ! Je suis preneur de tout témoignage sur l'usage d'un écran incurvé et d'un plat sur le même bureau.",

I know that this is on the low end of the HDR cert. but I’m wondering what my best approach is.\n\nI’ve already noticed that in SDR, colours look vivid and punchy, but the display itself isn’t very bright, whereas in HDR, the opposite is true. I’ve also noticed that the brighter the picture on screen, the dimmer the display gets, which slightly irks me, and I don’t want that to happen. I’ve tested SDR and HDR in Overwatch and Hogwarts: Legacy so far (those are the two games I’m playing at the moment), and OW looks really washed out in HDR, and not much brighter than SDR due to its bright nature.\n\nWhat’s my best approach in terms of HDR? Should I just leave it off and sacrifice brightness to get punchy colours, or should I enable it just to play darker games and/or when I watch HDR content? I have already calibrated it using the Windows tool. Many thanks!",

    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

But after using it and owning it I must say I am quite impressed and it sure exceeds my expectations.\n\nThe brightness 10/10. I flash banged myself on full screen white HDR video. (Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

[P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

OLED is out of the question because I don't want to deal with the inevitable burn in that gives a hard limit to the monitor's lifespan. That leaves IPS, and whether it comes with Mini-LED backlighting or not. \n\nAs of now, I'm not really bothered by \"black isn't really black\" but more the... dynamic range? In some games lots of details seem lost to crushed blacks and clipped highlights. When I turn on HDR the details come back but the colors look kind of wonky, especially in the Windows environment.\n\nWill appreciate feedback from anyone who has experience with the difference between regular IPS and Mini-LED/OLED in not-pitch-black room settings!",

I cant go any higher on the refresh rate - if i use e.g. `140`, `144` or `240` it just results in a black screen. \n\nHere's my questions:\n- Why cant i go higher on custom refresh rate - theoretically the display should be able to handle up to 240hz? \n- Would a custom (kernel/software) EDID solve this issue? If so - what are the risks? I'm not overclocking per se (it supports 240hz natively), so it might not be a problem? (I will *not* flash an EDID to the display via IPC, only sideload the EDID on the kernel side).\n\nThanks\n",

But after using it and owning it I must say I am quite impressed and it sure exceeds my expectations.\n\nThe brightness 10/10. I flash banged myself on full screen white HDR video. (Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

Currently running a 6yo 1080p 144hz 24in IPS ASUS TUF monitor. \n\nThe issue I have is that I also WFH c.7-8hrs/ day (outlook, excel, teams, the usual), so feels like I can't really go down the OLED route for risk of burn-in and a reduced work experience. Home office has a lot of unnatural light so assuming glare will be bad too. \n\nSo, I'm thinking something like a 1440p 240hz IPS at around 27inches is probably the best upgrade path, but happy to be convinced otherwise. I probably value frames/smoothness more than 4k though. However l, it feels like the product offering for this is quite low in the UK - I can't seem to find monitors like a Gigabyte M27Q X, the AOC XMN one, or anything really. \n\nSo, I'm wondering if you have any advice? Anyone in a similar boat? Any top choices in Q3 20205 for a WFH/gaming experience? Appreciate any advice or experiences!",

    "selftext": "\nFirst of all, sorry if I make any grammatical mistakes; I’m not a native English speaker, but I’ll try to explain myself as clearly as possible.\n\nAlright, let me give a bit of context. I’m a computer engineering student, and I have an Asus TUF Gaming F15 with an i7 13620H processor and an NVIDIA 4060 GPU. I use it for programming, studying, watching videos and movies, and playing games (I don’t play many FPS games; I prefer AAA titles and LoL hahaha). Basically, it’s an all-rounder. I know a laptop isn’t the most optimal thing in the world, but it’s very convenient for taking it to class, moving houses, etc.\n\nLately, after spending so many hours in front of the computer, I get tired very quickly, and I can’t spend more than 30 minutes straight programming or studying because with that small 15” screen and a keyboard that isn’t the most comfortable, I end up feeling overwhelmed. I don’t really know how to explain it, but after two years it’s like whenever I have to sit down to program, it feels really exhausting.\n\nSo I thought that to get the best of both a laptop and a desktop, I could set up a workstation at home to use my laptop like a tower PC, with a proper setup including a monitor (I think 1440p is optimal for my F15) and a keyboard (I was thinking of the Razer BlackWidow V3 TKL, but I’m open to suggestions). I’d also like minimal compatibility with the PS5, since I already have one, so I might as well use it.\n\nThe monitor is where I have doubts. I’ve been obsessed for weeks watching reviews, rankings, etc. In the price range I want, >€250, I’ve found two main contenders: the MSI MAG 274QRF-QD E2 and the AOC Q27G3XMN.\n\nI’ve read that the MSI has really good colors and comes highly recommended, but I honestly haven’t found many reviews. I relied a lot on the specs, and there’s no RTINGS review of this E2 model, only the previous one, which they tore apart for its HDR, basically calling it trash hahaha. This one has been seen here in Spain, where I live, for around €230-240, so I suppose during Black Friday it might drop to about €220.\n\nAny suggestion??? Any model that im missing?? \n\n",

    "selftext": "So I was recently in the market for a high end gaming+productivity monitor, decided to give miniLED a shot, KTC M27P6 specifically. I have plenty of experience with miniLED from current high end macbooks, so I thought if I could get something similar that would be great. Boy was it not even close. So local dimming ON in normal OS usage and web browsing looks horrific and is completely unusable. Every window thats not with pure black or white background is completely non-uniform with a gigantic darker halo following the cursor. Later I found out that apparently with external miniled monitors you are supposed to run local dimming exclusively for videos and games, and switch it off and have normal IPS mode for the OS. Is that actually the case for every external miniled monitor on the market? Even by legit brands like asus/samsung? You can't even enjoy the benefits of miniled in normal OS use with occasional black background for a website or a picture? I'll give it a bit of credit in terms of looking better than normal IPS in games and videos, and the LD off mode looks like a perfectly fine raw IPS monitor with phenomenal brightness too, I just have a hard time getting behind not being able to \"set and forget\" the monitor settings as well as not being able to use LD on for general OS use. Btw LD auto mode doesn't actually remove the need for manual switching, it just ties it to the hdr, so you have to manually switch HDR. Apple seems to have pulled off local dimming zones being on permanently and looking decent by having 6x the zone density and having a tight controller integration into the frame drawing pipeline. If this is indeed the state of miniled monitors on the market rn, this is just another reason to ditch LCD for oled. Unless I'm missing something?",

So I thought it’s a good time to upgrade, after doing a lot of research and reading what all you nice people think about different technologies I decided to go for a high refresh rate IPS panel, since I work with colours as part of my job making the colour accuracy useful there as well as the refresh rate for clicking heads in CS and BF6. \n\nI had also seen rave reviews of mini led and how amazing HDR can be, but I was struggling to find a mini led IPS panel, I’ve seen display ninjas reviews of some KTC monitors so was keeping my eye out but all the ones available to me seem to be VA. So when I saw an IPS panel with mini led I jumped the gun and bought it even though I couldn’t find a review and there was no review on DisplayNinja. \n\nSo I bought the KOORUI S2721PM from Amazon (it had good reviews on there) but jumping into bf6 I noticed these dark squares when in bright scenes and looking around. I’ve done my best to capture it on a video on my phone and I think you can see it. I’ve tried it with HDR on windows turned on and off and it still happens. I have tried it in a few different scenarios, for example the video is on operation firestorm on BF6 but on other maps in that game I can’t replicate it. Seems to be fine on Cairo and Liberation Peak in the detailed sections. Also tried it on CS and it doesn’t seem to have an issue with any map on that game.\n\nHas anyone seen this before? Is there anything I can change to stop this from happening? Is this a Mini LED feature or is it this budget mini led monitor at fault? \n\nAny help is appreciated cos I am incredibly lost. TIA\n",

    "title": "ASUS ROG XG27AQDPG (500Hz 1440p QD-OLED) Written Review",
    "selftext": "ASUS ROG SWIFT XG27AQDPG REVIEW\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/JAbpUPTGknQ\n\nPS: I was sent this sample unit by ASUS ROG and have been testing it extensively for about two and half weeks.\n\nTL; DR: XG27AQDPG Review\n\nAesthetics: 8.5/10\n\nSemi-Glossy QD-OLED Panel: 9/10\n\nText Clarity: 8/10\n\nMotion Clarity: 10/10 (Best I’ve ever seen)\n\nMy PC Specs:\n\nGPU: ASUS ROG Astral GeForce RTX™ 5090 OC Edition\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16-Core Processor\n\nRAM: CORSAIR Dominator Titanium RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB\n\nSTORAGE: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280\n\nMy Background: I work in IT and I am also a content creator; I not only use my computer for work utilizing excel and Word among other IT related programs. But I also edit my own videos on my PC with Adobe Premiere as well. I play a large variety of games, everything from JRPGS, MOBAs, Third Person Shooters, Immersive Sims, FPS, Platformers and more! And one of my favorite games that I have been playing for the past 10 years is Overwatch which I have 2K+ hours and have peaked at high masters in competitive. The monitor feels like it is targeted toward competitive gamers that want a ridiculously high refresh rate display, excellent motion clarity and a gorgeous looking display.\n\nTested monitors -\n\n1440p QD-OLED: XG27AQDPG\n\n4K QD-OLED: PG32UCDM\n\nAesthetics & Stand: I really love the aesthetic of the ASUS ROG monitors. I know the hyper gamer look isn’t for everyone but I personally adore it. I love that this monitor once again has the flat stand instead of the “spider legs”. As an owner of a very large gaming mat and someone that moves his peripherals around all the time this monitor stand is perfect for my case usage. Just like always if you decide to use the backlight aura sync on the display, you will be presented with some excellent colors on the back of your display, really ideal if the back of your monitor is facing a wall.\n\n500Hz 1440p 27” QD-OLED Experience: So, first thing I would like to state is I haven’t been the owner of a 16:9 1440p monitor in almost 2 years. I did own the G9 Neo & G9 OLED at one point, but the last 1440p 16:9 I owned was the Asus PG27AQN, a 1440p 360Hz IPS display. At the time I loved it but as higher end 4K monitors started releasing I haven’t been interested in any 1440p displays again until now. I am definitely not saying a 1440p display is in anyway as sharp as a 32” or even 27” 4K display, but I think it’s sharp “enough” to say the least, especially with its specific case usage.\n\nNow to finally get to the point of why someone would get this monitor, which is the beautiful QD-OLED panel and downright ridiculous refresh rate of 500Hz. To say competitive games like Overwatch 2, Valorant, League of Legends, Rocket League and much more look absolutely ludicrous at 500Hz would be a huge understatement. The very high refresh rate, OLED motion clarity, QD-OLED vibrant color and accuracy, perfect black levels/infinite contrast, excellent picture quality all on a 1440p 27” display. In addition, with all the Asus ROG bells and whistles which consist of features like the proximity sensor, aspect control and so many other little things create in my opinion the most beautiful competitive gaming display you can experience today. Even as someone that glazes 4K 240Hz OLED monitors I highly prefer playing competitive games on XG27AQDPG over ANY OTHER DISPLAY I have ever used in my life. The level of fluidity and the crisp image is something you have to see in person to believe.\n\nText Clarity:\n\nI for sure missed the picture-perfect text clarity of a 4K display but with the PPI being 109. I had no problem reading text in games or even during regular desktop use, but just again be aware it will not be as sharp as a 4K monitor, even a 32” one which has a PPI of 138. Someone that is already used to a 27” probably won’t suffer from this issue but I did not like editing videos on a monitor this small. Regardless of resolution as someone that has been editing on 32” monitors and ultrawide displays I’m just not a fan of editing on a display so small. This isn’t the point of getting a monitor like this though and everything is still more then legible but I just wanted you’ll to be aware of my opinion on this.\n\nMotion clarity: Something as simple as reloading a gun in Overwatch 2 is overwhelming seeing in motion at 500Hz. The culmination of specs on this monitor is legitimately insane, so much so that playing competitive games on this monitor is somehow even more “beautiful” then when playing on 4K 240Hz. Which doesn’t really make sense since it’s a lower resolution but smoothness of the image almost makes the game feel more lifelike if that makes sense. I don’t feel like we will get to the point of displays being indistinguishable from real life until we hit that 700Hz+ point. But then again what truly makes this monitor so special is that in addition to having the very high refresh rate is it also looks freaking outstanding because it’s a QD-OLED display.\n\nTesting Of Competitive Games: So, I found that quite a few games were able to hit 500Hz even at max settings. But most were still able to hit it after tinkering with some settings even if it wasn’t able to consistently stay at above 500Hz (there were outliers though sadly). Now remember to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nCompetitive Games Experience\n\nOverwatch 2 Max Settings: 300-400 FPS\n\nOverwatch 2 Tinkered Settings 400-550 FPS\n\nRocket League: Max Settings 700+ FPS\n\nCSGO 2 Max & Tinkered Settings 300-400 FPS (Nothing I did got the fps close to 500 ☹)\n\nValorant: Max Settings 500-700 FPS\n\nLeague Of Legends Max or Tinkered Settings: 500+ FPS consistently\n\nMarvel Rivals Disclaimer Now this is a special case because this game is ridiculously CPU heavy with so many CPU calculations going one with things like Dr Strange portal. I was able to get like 300+ fps with only DLSS enabled raytracing off or on, and with frame gen like 350+. But playing with frame gen is kind of counterproductive to a competitive game so I recommend not using more than 2X MFG if anything.\n\nMarvel Rivals Max Settings DLSS With Ray Tracing: 250+\n\nMarvel Rivals: DLSS Without Ray Tracing 325+ FPS\n\nMarvel Rivals: Frame Gen Without/Without Ray Tracing 350+ FPS\n\nTesting of Non-Competitive Games\n\nSo, these next few games are games that I not only love playing but also showcasing on my channel when I am testing and doing showcases. But do take into account that to reach the 500fps threshold or even get close a mix of DLSS and Multi Frame Gen had to be used on some titles. But with none of these games being competitive, ridiculously low input lag isn’t necessarily needed (Arc Raiders & Big Maybe BF6 might be exceptions). And in my honest opinion what makes this monitor so darn special is you can dial up all the settings to max and get at least 150+ fps in like ever title. Or if the game is not demanding at all or with the help of DLSS and or Frame Gen, games that you wouldn’t even think would be able to even touch close to 500Hz had very surprising results. I tested more games but this gives you a gist of the performance you can get with different non-competitive titles. Remember again to take into account my PC specs (above) before reading these numbers.\n\nNon-Competitive Games\n\nDoom Eternal: Max Settings with Ray Tracing 275-325 FPS\n\nDoom Eternal: Medium Settings & No Raytracing: 400-500 FPS\n\nHollow Knight: 800 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Max Settings, DLAA & Raytracing: 75-95 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Medium Settings DLSS Balanced with MFG 3X 250-300…4X: 330-375 FPS\n\nExpedition 33: Low Settings DLSS Ultra Performance with MFG 4X 400-455 FPS\n\nReturnal: Max Settings No DLSS 150-212 FPS (Even with enabling just DLSS Quality-Ultra Performance there was no FPS increase)\n\nReturnal: Max Settings DLSS Quality & Frame Gen 325-375 FPS (Switching to other DLSS methods didn’t change framerate for me most likely because of the 5090 lol)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing No Frame Gen Enabled & Path Tracing 59-62 FPS (This might seem super low but being able to run this game natively at any resolution and get above 60 fps is really impressive. This is one of the most demanding games of all time!)\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 90-100 FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 100+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 150+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA Path Tracing, Frame Gen 3X Enabled 190+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality-Performance, No Frame Gen & Path Tracing 200-350 FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 200+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 360+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 2X Enabled 230+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Quality, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 425+ FPS\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Max Settings, DLSS Performance, No Path or Ray Tracing, Frame Gen 4X Enabled 450+ FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing, DLAA No Frame Gen: 140-150 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 2X: 240-270 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Max Settings/Raytracing DLAA Frame Gen 3X: 325-340 FPS\n\nArc Raiders: Medium Settings/Low Raytracing DLSS Ultra Performance Frame Gen 4X: 480-500 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & No Frame Gen 70-95 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 130-150 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 190-215 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4X 240-277 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 2X 350-375 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 3X 375-440 FPS\n\nDoom Dark Ages: Max Settings, DLAA, No Path Tracing & Frame Gen 4x 475-525 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA No Frame Gen 150-175 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 2X 250+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 3X 380+ FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLAA Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Frame Gen 4X 460-500 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 2X 344-380 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 3X 430-450 FPS\n\nBattlefield 6: Max Settings, DLSS Quality 4X 500-540 FPS\n\nAsus Monitor Features: Firstly, the response time is 0.03ms if frame gen was not enabled every single movement of the mouse felt instantaneous unlike any other monitor I’ve used. In addition, you also have OLED Anti Flicker 2.0 which to my knowledge is an exclusive feature to ASUS monitors. In addition, the monitor comes equipped ELMB (BFI) which does a good job of removing motion blur on their displays I will be honest though you’re not really seeing much blur at 500Hz anyway. But when playing lower refresh rate titles, it is definitely an amazing feature. The Proximity Sensor is also amazing and is just one of the handful of tools that come in ASUS OLED CARE PRO. Which does a really job of slowing down the process of burn in on the display. The 3 Year warranty is great and ASUS DisplayWidget Center which also you to tinker with your monitor settings right on the desktop is Stellar. Lastly, I would like to state that with this monitor being HDR500 over HDR400 like found on previous OLED displays you can expect a overall brighter image and it is very pleasant.\n\nAspect Control Mode: Now this is probably one of the coolest features on ASUS monitors today but it works the best on here than I have ever seen on any display ever. To my knowledge this is the only 500Hz 1440p QD-OLED monitor that is capable of doing this with only tinkering in Nvidia Control Panel or the AMD equivalent and not using a thirds party program (which still doesn’t support the full 1440p resolution). But this monitor can do full 2560x1440 500Hz in its 24.5 inch mode and my goodness it is glorious. Being able to play at that resolution on a 500Hz 25” QD-OLED display is god-like. I definitely get the hoopla of playing competitive games at that size and being able to do it with the crazy specs of this display really makes for a fantastic experience.\n\nAt this moment in time this is easily the best looking competitive gaming monitor when it comes to fidelity, motion, refresh rate and colors. The Tandem variant is supposed to release later this year and if you prioritize oily black levels, a brighter image (540Hz on the higher tier model) and then also the 720p 720Hz dual mode that variant might be more ideal for you. But if you are fine with 500Hz (which is more then enough LOL) and a more vibrant monitor in color and realistic picture because of the QD-OLED Panel the XG27AQDPG might be the perfect monitor for you. I had ridiculously high expectations for this display and it still blew me away!\n\nOverall Score: 9.6/10",

That leaves IPS, and whether it comes with Mini-LED backlighting or not. \n\nAs of now, I'm not really bothered by \"black isn't really black\" but more the... dynamic range? In some games lots of details seem lost to crushed blacks and clipped highlights. When I turn on HDR the details come back but the colors look kind of wonky, especially in the Windows environment.\n\nWill appreciate feedback from anyone who has experience with the difference between regular IPS and Mini-LED/OLED in not-pitch-black room settings!",

    "selftext": "Monitor model: LG 34GL750-B, 34\" Ultrawide 2560x1080, 144Hz, had it for like 4 years now\n\nThis thing just appeared one day... can't tell if it's cuz of physical damage, or something like a stuck pixel, or just age, I'm really confused. As you can see in the first pic, theres a black line of pixels and a spot on said line with red pixels, which then extends upwards with a sort of vertical line with greenish tinted pixels, however...\n\nWhen i have something on-screen, like let's say a movie or a game, this black line seems to sort of \"copy\" a line of pixels somewhere above it, as seen in the other pic (that's from a \"stuck pixel remover\" website btw, tried it for like 20 min, did nothing)\n\nAny help understanding what exactly is going on would be greatly appreciated, thanks :)\n\nI'm planning on buying a new monitor soon anyway, since this one's like 4 years old now, not the oldest out there, i know, but still",

I cant go any higher on the refresh rate - if i use e.g. `140`, `144` or `240` it just results in a black screen. \n\nHere's my questions:\n- Why cant i go higher on custom refresh rate - theoretically the display should be able to handle up to 240hz? \n- Would a custom (kernel/software) EDID solve this issue? If so - what are the risks? I'm not overclocking per se (it supports 240hz natively), so it might not be a problem? (I will *not* flash an EDID to the display via IPC, only sideload the EDID on the kernel side).\n\nThanks\n",

    "selftext": "Firstly. WOW.\n\nI was honestly very skeptical about this monitor given that there are practically no reviews on it. But after using it and owning it I must say I am quite impressed and it sure exceeds my expectations.\n\nThe brightness 10/10. I flash banged myself on full screen white HDR video. (Would do it again). \n\nThe image quality 8.8/10. Yes it's not an OLED but this thing sure gives any matte OLED display a run for its money. I was actually going to buy the new Gigabyte MO27Q28G Tandem WOLED monitor however ultimately I was not prepared to buy disposable tech which burns in as I do a lot of productivity work. But compared to some matte OLED's I have seen this monitor is pretty damn close.\n\nLocal Dimming 8.5/10. Haloing is imperceptible to my eye. I can see some very minor blooming but to be totally honest I think most people are not gonna see it unless they look for it (Note I use this monitor with the Local Dimming set to Level 3). I don't mind loosing some details to get better blacks. \n\nGhosting would be a solid 9/10. There is some ghosting as per what I saw on the UFO test however to my eyes it's not a big deal and I don't notice it anyways and I would suspect that most people won't notice it anyways.\n\nThe panel is VERY responsive, I don't see slow reaction times. I run the display on the second fastest overdrive settings (out of box). \n\nI did notice something funny. HDR refused to work at 300Hz in Windows and the display wouldn't be detected as a HDR display unless I cracked it down to 240Hz. This is also on the latest FW update.\n\n\n\n",

Currently running a 6yo 1080p 144hz 24in IPS ASUS TUF monitor. \n\nThe issue I have is that I also WFH c.7-8hrs/ day (outlook, excel, teams, the usual), so feels like I can't really go down the OLED route for risk of burn-in and a reduced work experience. Home office has a lot of unnatural light so assuming glare will be bad too. \n\nSo, I'm thinking something like a 1440p 240hz IPS at around 27inches is probably the best upgrade path, but happy to be convinced otherwise. I probably value frames/smoothness more than 4k though. However l, it feels like the product offering for this is quite low in the UK - I can't seem to find monitors like a Gigabyte M27Q X, the AOC XMN one, or anything really. \n\nSo, I'm wondering if you have any advice? Anyone in a similar boat? Any top choices in Q3 20205 for a WFH/gaming experience? Appreciate any advice or experiences!",

I’ve been doing some research but I honestly can’t decide between these options below.\n\nI know they’re not all in the same price range, but I don’t mind spending a couple hundred bucks more if it’s actually worth it since it’s a one-time purchase.\n\nI’ll mainly be using it for productivity and office work (lots of multitasking, documents, presentations etc.), but I also want really stunning colours and picture quality. Something that just looks great to look at and easy on the eyes as some screens give me a headache.\n\nThe part I’m a bit confused about is the difference between VA and IPS panels when it comes to picture quality, contrast, and colour accuracy. I’ve read mixed opinions online.\n\nHere are my top contenders (not limited to): \nDell S3425DW \nDell P3425WE \nLG 34WR55QK-B \nMSI MPG 346CQRF X24 \nAOC CU34G2XPD\n\nWould really appreciate your advice or personal experience with any of these.",

    "selftext": "\nFirst of all, sorry if I make any grammatical mistakes; I’m not a native English speaker, but I’ll try to explain myself as clearly as possible.\n\nAlright, let me give a bit of context. I’m a computer engineering student, and I have an Asus TUF Gaming F15 with an i7 13620H processor and an NVIDIA 4060 GPU. I use it for programming, studying, watching videos and movies, and playing games (I don’t play many FPS games; I prefer AAA titles and LoL hahaha). Basically, it’s an all-rounder. I know a laptop isn’t the most optimal thing in the world, but it’s very convenient for taking it to class, moving houses, etc.\n\nLately, after spending so many hours in front of the computer, I get tired very quickly, and I can’t spend more than 30 minutes straight programming or studying because with that small 15” screen and a keyboard that isn’t the most comfortable, I end up feeling overwhelmed. I don’t really know how to explain it, but after two years it’s like whenever I have to sit down to program, it feels really exhausting.\n\nSo I thought that to get the best of both a laptop and a desktop, I could set up a workstation at home to use my laptop like a tower PC, with a proper setup including a monitor (I think 1440p is optimal for my F15) and a keyboard (I was thinking of the Razer BlackWidow V3 TKL, but I’m open to suggestions). I’d also like minimal compatibility with the PS5, since I already have one, so I might as well use it.\n\nThe monitor is where I have doubts. I’ve been obsessed for weeks watching reviews, rankings, etc. In the price range I want, >€250, I’ve found two main contenders: the MSI MAG 274QRF-QD E2 and the AOC Q27G3XMN.\n\nI’ve read that the MSI has really good colors and comes highly recommended, but I honestly haven’t found many reviews. I relied a lot on the specs, and there’s no RTINGS review of this E2 model, only the previous one, which they tore apart for its HDR, basically calling it trash hahaha. This one has been seen here in Spain, where I live, for around €230-240, so I suppose during Black Friday it might drop to about €220.\n\nAny suggestion??? Any model that im missing?? \n\n",

Out of the box yes but with EQ bass shelf on 6xx it gets much closer. They complement them well. 6xx is more of an intimate sound, XV is more spacious.\n\nKick drums and high hat sound perfect IMO. Love it\n\nOne weird thing I noticed....I always run through freq sweeps and tone generators every once in awhile to make sure there is no driver buzzing or other weird stuff going on.\n\nWith these Edition XV, there is no driver buzzing. However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos?

I found these HiFi For All stands (pictured) which are affordable, and solve the problem, but I would prefer one with a bit of a longer headband area (vs just wide depth-wise). Like the ones on Gadgetry’s vids - there is one that has a little knob that looks like it is for length adjustment that looks nice too, but I can’t find it on the net. (Third picture, from his Aune AR5000 review, sorry for blurriness).\n\nI am thinking there must be some hidden gems out there that are reasonable affordable, and available in the US sans tariff/import fees, preferably.",

Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger.

    "selftext": "**source:** tidal or personal flac files through bluetooth aptx\n\n**FIT:**\n\nHDB 630 - very comfortable but loosest of the bunch. felt a bit insecure. if l looked up or shook my head I had that feeling they may fall off. smaller ear cups too if you're concern about that and I could feel contact with my ears but nothing uncomfortable for me.\n\nPX7 S3 - slightly more clamping force which got a little uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. best seal out of the bunch so pick your poison.\n\nPx8 S2 - most comfortable. not too tight, not too loose. just right on my head. doesn't feel insecure.\n\n**BUILD QUALITY:**\n\nHDB 630 - decent. I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

    "title": "3 year Review of the Audeze LCD-X (Post 2021 Version)",
    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn’t that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don’t have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I’ve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don’t I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars). Any other suggestions are welcome, looking for open backs with a big soundstage as well as a bass boost. Not too concerned with neutrality. ",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

    "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI'm here today to ask you about the dongle DAC's that is usable with Windows-based PC.\n\nI know there are a lot of them for different price points, and I guess I didn't need them too much, because I only got easy to drive SGH 9500 and Beyers 770 Pro X LE (that are stupidly broken by themselves in the can connection points with very light gentle use and now I'm awaiting for them to return from the service), but now I want to try IEM's and I guess I need a better source then my motherboard audio.\n\nFor the start I don't want to get anything crazy, simply because I'm in Ukraine and I try to keep my purchases relatively cheap, so that's why I want to go under 100 USD with dongle or something portable.\n\nBut as far as I know the things that work well with the phones may have some issues on the PC side of things.\n\nSo I need a dongle, that have a clear sound and also didn't fall asleep, disconnect rapidly or have driver problems on the PC.\n\nI will get something better if there will be safe again, but for now I need something reliable and fun.\n\nI was thinking about Apple Dongle and TRN Black Pearl, but I heard that TRN one have some issues with entering a standby mode so it can fade out notifications etc. And the driver is not too good for the PC use.\n\nI'll happily read all your recommendations, thank you so much in advance.\n\n  \nUPD: Thank you everyone, I've got Apple dongle for now and I guess I'll go with something more meaty bit later.",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

The mesh around it too get earwax on them, needing to clean them every few days.  \nIt's just become a regular routine for me to clean off my earwax atleast once a day to avoid getting my ears shut off due to the wax. Was not too confident with hydrogen peroxide, so got an ear camera cleaning tool by bebird, and honestly it is quite good to use.  \nThe scoop is silicone based so i dont feel much sceptical about it to not put in my ear... However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

    "selftext": "That cord always ends up tangled in my pocket, a tiny knot of chaos I have to spend minutes undoing. My clumsy fingers wrestle with the plastic wire, while people with wireless earbuds would’ve already finished two songs by now. It’s been too long—its rubber coating has started to get sticky, the volume button on the controller feels jammed, and sometimes there’s a faint electric buzz in the right ear. Maybe it’s time to replace it.\n\nBut I just can’t quit that little click when I plug it into my phone.\nSo soft, yet so solid.\nLike the sound of an old door lock turning, shutting the whole world out.\n\nWalking is the worst. The wire swings across my chest, rustling against my jacket’s zipper. On the stairs I have to hold it tight, or it’ll catch on the railing. Windy days are even worse—the wire tangles in my hair and pulls hard enough to hurt. I still remember that rainy day when my best friend and I huddled under the convenience store awning. She naturally took off her right earbud and handed it to me:\n“Listen—this intro is amazing.”\nA raindrop slid down the wire into my collar, cold and sharp. We stood together in that shared ninety centimeters of space, and the warmth of her body seemed to flow through the copper line. For a moment, the rain really did feel like decoration.\n\nNow my friend wears thousand-yuan noise-cancelling headphones, walking with confidence, never worrying about tangled cords. She says technology is great—it’s freed us from the wire.\nBut I’m still using this glitchy old pair, the left side fine, the right side buzzing now and then—only working if I hold it at just the right angle. Like me, struggling in that night without an ending—broken, stuttering, unclear.\n\nYesterday on my way to class, the wire snagged on my backpack strap again. I crouched to untie the knot while the person behind me clicked their tongue in annoyance. But honestly, I kind of enjoy this clumsiness. Wireless feels too perfect—perfect like a lie. The spotless charging case, the precise touch controls, never tangled, never messy. But my life is a tangle—why should my music be perfectly ordered?\n\nThis wired earphone has been with me for nearly three years. The braided cable is pilling, the gold plating on the plug worn thin. These flaws are like folded corners in an old diary, recording every ordinary day. Of course a new pair would be better—sleek and shiny—but it doesn’t know my ears. It hasn’t heard the song I played on repeat after you left during that fight. It doesn’t know the white noise that lulled me to sleep on sleepless nights.\n\nLast month I almost replaced it. I even placed the order for the newest model—then canceled it at 3 a.m. The customer service agent asked if there was a problem with the product.\n“No,” I said. “The problem’s with me.”\n—Nostalgia is a sickness with no cure.\n\nToday, as the taxi climbed the overpass, the right ear suddenly went silent. I instinctively twisted the yellowed plug, feeling the rough edge of the tape under my fingers. The river below flowed calmly, and in my left ear Eason Chan was singing:\n‘The water knows well—it’s my duty to cherish the flowers.’\nThe music sounded thin, like a bird that had lost one wing.\nAnd still, I never replaced these earphones.\n\nThe right one is dead now. So be it. One side is enough.\nThis worn-out cord I clung to—\nin the end, it couldn’t keep the two worlds playing in sync.",

These guys are fascinatingly good for their price tag and I definitely prefer them over my Sony MDR-EX110APBs, which cost more than double (which is still basically nothing) and have a piercing spike every time someone dares to enunciate sibilants.\n\nI would say the star of the Samsung x AKG's sound is the round (close to tubby) bass combined with a slightly veiled presentation of the rest of the spectrum (treble is definitely rolled off so you won't get attacked by a sneaky TSS TSSS), which makes them a warm-sounding, non-tiring pair of cheap in-ears. Meovv's 'Burning Up' is a joy to listen to on these, while Testament's current album 'Para Bellum' could use more aggressive mids and a generally brighter sound signature. Now that is only my perception of the sound and your experience might vary.\n\nDo you have the EO-IG955? If so, do you like them? Curious to hear your thoughts :)\n\nBest regards",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\njust want to share some of my feelings and likings about my current Hifi-Desktop-Setup which is build of\n\n1. Eversolo DAP-A6 Gen 2 Streamer  \n2. Burson Conductor Voyager Max DAC/AMP  \n3. ModHouse Tungsten DS V1\n\n \n\nI had a lot of headphones before like Mezes Empy II or Elite, DCAs Expanse, ZMFs Atrium and Verite open, Finals D8000 Pro and Hifimans HE1000 Stealth. After all of them I can say after one moth I own the Tungsten, the Tungsten is the clear winner for me.\n\nBase is such punchy and crisp at the same time and goes so crazy deep. Holy smokes. Its also wonderful layered.\n\nMids are present but not so much in your face as Finals D8000 Pro. Its more like the HE1000 Stealth.\n\nTreble is smooth and not fatiguing overall. It’s on a great level.\n\nOn comfort side the Mezes are better and still the Hifiman egg-shaped are nicer at least for my head. But compared to ZMF and Final I prefer the Tungsten. In the hand it feels handcrafted and a bit cheap, but on the had its all gone and after the first notes reach my ears all is forgotten.\n\nLayering is better then all the others beside of Final D8000 Pro. From all I heard until now Final has the craziest layering of all Headphones. Stage is really nice around my head. Not as wide as Hifimans, but for my on the second place. Separation is top notch and its very easy to spot each instrument.\n\nBut the beast needs juice. And a lot of it! Its crazy. While I could run the Empy IIs on 10 out of 100 at high gain the Tungsten needs at least 50 of 100 to show up.\n\nV2 of them should be easier to drive. But the Burson drive them awesomely well. Sure it’s a 4k DAC/Amp for a 2k headphone. But this combination is just top notch and better as everything I was pleased to hear.\n\nThat are my short 2 cents after 1,5 months I own the tungsten now. Empy II are sold. And I was also able to try Abyss 1266 Phi TC as well. The base of these are crazy, but overall the sound signature feels very off for me. The Tungsten are so round.\n\nSo if you can drive them I really recommend them at least to try. These is my personal endgame and now I’m searching for a nice DAP/IEM combo for on the go :D\n\nCheers,\n\nQ",

    "selftext": "I’ve been comparing HE600, FT1 Pro, FT7, Edition XV, Edition XS, Arya Stealth, AR5000, HD600, HD6XX, and Sony MDR-MV1. These are my subjective impressions based on extended listening. I’m more of a vocal listener. My priority: — mid > treble > bass.\n\n**AR5000 and Arya Stealth**  \nPersonally, I love AR5000 and Arya Stealth the most for enjoying music.\n\n* **AR5000** has great treble and air while maintaining the rich texture of the vocals, which is very hard to do imo. And also has great, impactful bass. It's lightweight and very comfortable. I do find its soundstage a bit strange. Sometimes it feels narrow, sometimes it feels wide.\n* **Arya Stealth** is more detailed than AR5000, vocals are more refined and organic than AR5000, but not as intimate. It is darker than Edition XS, with vocals more lush, smooth, and textured. Resolution is better, treble is not harsh. I increased 12 kHz for the Stealth to sound really airy — it just sounds so good for vocals with EQ, quite addicted. Its high notes create head-cavity resonance that feels immersive. Ar5000 has more bite to it in its treble, but Arya is more airy, and has better sound stage.\n\n**HE600**\n\n* Overall, balanced and detailed, but somewhat bland and boring. It might be good for studio use. Does nothing wrong, but has no particular characteristics.\n* Bass is fast and clean, but not immersive — it just signals its presence instead of pulling you in. It will tell you \"Hey, there is bass that goes really deep\" instead of immersing you with it.\n* Treble is not as bright as Edition Xs.\n* Vocals lack the texture and emotion of other headphones. They sound incredibly smooth, though.\n* Imaging is stronger than most of other headphones.\n* Guitars are less engaging than ft1 pro.\n\n**Edition XV vs FT1 Pro**\n\n* Edition XV 's vocals are very round, textured, and have more presence than FT1 Pro. Feels like listening through a r2r dac.\n* Compared to FT1 Pro, Edition XV's resolution is stronger, instrument positioning is more precise, and imaging is clear and cohesive. Pro has sounds mostly at the sides or front and feels more smeared.\n* Treble is not as bright as Pro. The bass is tighter and of higher quality.\n* I would enjoy XV for casual listening while working.\n* Vocals do sound more nasal/unnatural in some tracks.\n\n**Edition XS**\n\nI was thinking of keeping both Arya Stealth and Edition Xs, because some songs on Edition Xs sound more exciting due to its brightness. But its vocals lack the richness of the stealth, so I decided to return it.\n\n* It can sound bright, but EQ improves it.\n* Soundstage feels tall.\n* Vocals are thicker and closer than I expected\n* Compared to FT7, XS vocals are thicker, and the stage is taller.\n* In some songs, XS is more exciting, but in others, Stealth is more satisfying.\n\n**FT7**\n\n* Leather pads are preferred over fabric. Fabric pads just sound muffled. just... very strange.\n* Leather pads give enjoyable treble but thin vocals.\n* A good headphone, but nothing stands out too much.\n* It is detailed, but not as engaging as hifiman headphones.\n\n**FT1 Pro**\n\nIt has three blobs sound stages, the same as HD600 and HD6xx. A warm headphone in general, and not very detailed. instruments tend to mix together.\n\n* Vocals have more texture and presence than he600/ft7\n* Guitars are more engaging.\n* Bass has more atmosphere than HE600. I really enjoy its bass, very dynamic and immersive.\n\n**HD600 and HD6XX**\n\n* HD600's vocal is really great, probably among top 2 in all these headphones. but due to its strange soundstage, I decided to return it. For people who don't mind narrow/three-blob soundstage, definitely worth checking it out.\n* HD6XX is overall darker in treble, but some areas can feel brighter or more piercing than HD600. I find hd600's vocal is less bright in most songs.\n* HD600 has very few bass.\n* HD6XX has a slightly larger stage; vocals slightly further.\n* Both have a concentrated stage around the sides of the ears.\n\n**Sony MDR-MV1**\n\n* Vocals sound muffled.\n* The soundstage is small.\n* I hate it.\n\n**Personal Tier List:**\n\n* **Tie 1:** Arya Stealth, AR5000\n* **2:** Edition XV\n* **3:** Edition XS\n* **4:**  FT1 Pro, FT7\n* **5:** HE600, HD600\n* **6:** HD6XX\n* **10000:** Sony MDR-MV1\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, Just want to clarify that this is not an \"objective review\", these are my subjective impressions, and I stand by what I wrote. As I said at the very beginning, I have my own priorities when it comes to headphones. I know some people really enjoy Sony MDR-MV1 and I am happy you enjoyed them.

The FT1 coming from some really good planar iems is an amazing leap forward for paying basically the same price. I ordered better ear pads, a capra strap. These will be the ultimate cans. Unfortunately the description on the graph site isn't detailed enough for me personally to truly understand so now we are here.\n\nI feel like the ft1's sound is very relaxing. The bass is phenomenal and very deep and visceral. The vocals are smooth. Treble is good for long term listening I'll say. But I feel like I can get a bit more excitement from these headphones. I listen to a lot of rap, a lot of female vocalist from all genres, house, dance, alternative. So bass is a common thing amongst all these genres. Boom, I added a bit more sub bass to give me some extra feelings. I've heard the sennheiser having amazing mids and since the ft1's are mildly v shaped, I raised the mids a tad bit. So I kinda eq'ed my graph to reflect the HDB 630 lower and upper mids and kept the rest the same. It's for sure, much more engaging vocally. I never realized how laid back vocals were. I will try the 6XX mids and see if I like it more. I know drivers play a big part in how sound truly is portrayed. But It made a good enough difference.\n\nNow I'm curious on some things I've noticed. What is the peak in the ft1's line around 1.8K. What is this specific frequency range responsible for. I also noticed the ft1's has a lot less treble in the 6-7K range than most cans. I felt like treble is the feeling I felt on my bones in the front of my face. I did notice raising this area was responsible for this feeling, that's maybe why these aren't as fatiguing to listen to long term. I'm a bit sensitive to treble but even the s12 planars I eq'ed like -2db from 6-7.5K and it was perfect. So I can for sure bump this area up a bit. It's interesting because my friend can use the dt 770's at high volume no issues. I could never lol. Those are some bright cans. I used to have em a long time ago that's why I have em on the graph for comparison.\n\nMy last question is eq'ing 8K or higher worth it and what immediate effects would I notice bumping this region?\n\nThanks for feedback, genuinely I'm such an immersive listener. I like to feel my music truly. If anyone here is a fan on the album Kiss Land by the weeknd. Arguably the most immersive album I ever heard. I'm very big on concept and immersion! even for video games.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’ve been experimenting with some EQ presets and wanted to share them for feedback and to see what you’ve all tried as well.\n\nFor this experiment, I used AutoEq's Custom Parametric Eq for the AZ100.\n\n**Custom 1** is **strictly the Harman target curve,** every band matches it as closely as possible.  \n**Custom 2** and **Custom 3** are my personal tweaks designed to make things a bit more fun and engaging while still staying grounded in the Harman philosophy.\n\nThe reason some numbers look a bit extreme is because **“flat” on these earbuds isn’t truly flat**, so Custom 1 compensates for that to accurately reflect Harman’s response.\n\n**Custom 1 (Strict Harman Reference):**  \n\\-9, -3, +3, 0, +2, 0, +2, -10\n\n**Custom 2 (+Bass):**  \n\\-3, -3, +3, 0, +2, 0, +2, -10\n\n**Custom 3 (++Bass):**  \n\\+1, -3, +3, 0, +1, +1, +2, -10\n\nCustom 2 boosts the bass for a fuller low end.  \nCustom 3 goes further, the **4 kHz and 8 kHz bands** are slightly adjusted to **compensate for the bass lift** so it still aligns with the Harman curve in the upper mids and treble region, no change needed to the 250hz range.\n\nCurious how these sound to others. I understand this is a subjective thing, but what EQs have you guys tried?",

    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI’m starting up a YouTube channel where I talk about Hi-Fi gear, but from the perspective of someone who mostly listens to bass-heavy music: hip-hop, R&B, reggaeton, metal, all the stuff that doesn’t usually get talked about much in the Hi-Fi space.\n\nI’m not asking for buying advice or comparisons, just looking to get some thoughts from people here about what kind of topics or angles would be cool to cover.\n\nI’ve got a few video ideas lined up already:\n\n1: Intro to the hobby : kind of an overview of what “Hi-Fi”actually is, why it’s fun even if your playlists are full of bass-heavy stuff, some common misconceptions, and how EQ can really help shape your sound. Also sort of some intro recs on how you can get a great setup for the same price you could wait a pair of ANC headphones or even less. \n\n2: Wireless ANC headphones: these are where most people start with higher-end gear, so I wanted to do something that talks about that whole category and how it fits into the hobby, especially for people who like tweaking sound profiles and are into bass heavy genres. \n\n3: Talking about my own gear: I’ve got a few headphones I love (HE1K Unveiled, Meze Empyrean 1) and thought it’d be fun to share what I like about them, how they respond to EQ, and how to get the sound you want out of your own setup.\n\nI think there’s room for more content that connects the “audiophile” side of things with the kind of music a lot of us listen to every day, but isn’t really represented in reviews or general talk of the hobby. Sort of give my thoughts on finding the perfect balance of a good thump in the bass, and a super clear rest of the song which just makes the music feel incredibly natural. If you’ve got ideas for what you’d want to see in that kind of channel, I’d love to hear them!\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to read, I’ll share the channel later once the first video’s up. Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT: one last thing, I speak Spanish fluently so I’m thinking of making a Spanish channel as well, if you’re here and speak Spanish and would like that lmk! Thanks! ",

    "selftext": "I was first drugged into using IEMs by a friend — that’s how it all started. I began with budget models like the Tangzu Wan’er, then moved up to the Truthear Hexa and Kefine Delci. I thought I was having a slow and steady upgrade journey, and honestly, I was quite satisfied with it.\n\nFast forward 1 year later, I visited a local audio shop near where I live and got to demo some higher-end models. When I got back home, I still felt content with my budget but well-tuned combo — the Delci paired with the JCally JM08L. But I was wrong. I realized my fitting was actually problematic, and that pushed me to dig deeper into the hobby — researching, upgrading my DAC/amp and IEMs.\n\nI joined the Discord community of that local shop, and things escalated quickly. The more I learned and talked with people there, the deeper I fell into this rabbit hole. I became addicted to optimizing and fine-tuning every bit of my audio setup.\nTwo months passing by — I think I’ve finally reached a point where I can be temporarily satisfied with my audio gear setup to close out 2025. Huge shout-out to SLaudio and all the amazing people in their discord community\n\nHappy listening, guys",

    "title": "An Up-To-Date Review of the Bose Open Ultra’s",
    "selftext": "For the TLDR: They’re fantastic buds that I do recommend if you have the extra cash, but if they’re on sale, they’re absolutely worth getting. \n\n**Sound**: I’m not an audiophile, musician, or any sort of person that knows what they’re talking about when it comes to sound quality. So take my opinion here for the normie opinion that it is when I say I think they sound fantastic. I’ve always been impressed with Bose’s acoustics, their products just seem to fill the room or your world in a way I haven’t seen with other products, and these earbuds are no different - particularly with their immersive audio mode. Which makes them feel (I’m choosing the word feel on purpose) like in-ears.   \nRegarding the immersive audio, I think it’s incredibly cool. What it does is employ some acoustics tricks to make the sound like it’s coming from a source in your room. It’s *very* convincing and actually confused me at first when I turned them on thinking there was sound coming from somewhere else when it was in fact the earbuds. The “source” location is placed front and slightly above you so that it sounds like the sound is all around you but will stay stationary if you move your head (which really makes the effect pop). If you move your head and stay in the new position for a bit, the buds will move the source after a few seconds to recreate the “all around” sound again. The “motion” mode just makes the reorientation happen constantly so it’s always slightly following behind your movement. I’ve found myself mostly just always leaving it in motion mode even when sitting and only really putting it in still mode when I want to play with the effect. Switching to the mode does impact the sound, but its just as if the equalizer got changed and you can adjust it out with the equalizer. \n\n**The open ear design:** I’m a huge fan. If I want to block out the world, I have a pair of QC35’s. I use these for anytime I want to be able to hear what’s going on around me or just won’t want to wear a bulky pair of cans and the open ear design is fantastic for it. that said, It does have a noticeable drawback in that it’s easy for outside noise to drown them out. Higher pitched sounds like clanking and crashes are what are going to do it the most, and car noises on busy streets will make you have to turn them up a decent amount to still hear what’s you’re listening to clearly - particularly if you’re listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Personally, I think the trade off is worth it because it’s not a *huge* problem, but it is a noticeable one. \n\n**Comfort:** I have extremely sensitive ears, basically anything that is touching my ears will make them ache after a while. Even beanies will make my ears hurt. So I was absolutely thrilled to find that these earbuds provided a pretty significant reduction in discomfort compared to any other pair of earbuds I’ve worn in my entire life. They’re not painless, and the discomfort is moved to a different location on the ear because of their unique placement, but it’s still a pretty significant improvement and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve also never had them fall out or been even remotely concerned about it. \n\nThey are meant to be placed as close to the ear canal as you can get them, for most people, this will be at a slight angle downwards with the hook placed just above the earlobe, but you can place them pretty much anywhere in the “hook zone” which is anywhere between the lobule and start antihelix of the outer ear, so long as the speakers are inside the general concha (I hope I got the terms right I had to google ear anatomy). You can calibrate the immersion mode to however you’ve placed them on your ear so you don’t need to worry about sound quality reduction, but volume does get noticeably reduced and it gets easier for outside noise to overpower them as the speakers get farther from your ear canal. \n\n**Connectivity:** This is a field where early reviews of the product were rather negative, however Bose seems to have addressed the concerns in their firmware updates since release because I’ve had no issues. They paired easily, immediately reconnect/disconnect when taking them in and out of the case, and easily switch between my paired devices without problem. They do lack a lot of the apple ecosystem bells and whistles you get from a pair of AirPods or Beats, but that’s not Bose’s fault so I’m overlooking it. \n\n**Battery Life:** They have served me great and I’ve yet to have them die on me before I was ready. I’m not using them for all day shifts or anything, but their advertised battery life seems pretty accurate to me, maybe even conservative. The immersion mode does reduce the battery life, but not so much it’s caused me issues, and I usually have them in immersion mode. \n\n**Calls:** This is another field where a lot of early reviews said they were awful, but after having had a few calls, and asking how I sounded, nobody said I sound particularly bad. One or two did note I didn’t sound the clearest, but said it wasn’t enough to be an issue. I know Bose put out a couple firmware updates to address those early complaints and it seems like they succeeded. \n\n**Price:** This is the kicker, at $300, the cost is a big ask. And whether or not it’s worth it will really just entirely depend on your personal finances. I got mine on sale and only paid $240 (I also cashed in reward money and got a limited edition pair which were $375 full price. In the end I only ended up paying \\~$40 out of pocket) so I’m super happy with them and absolutely think they were worth it. If I had paid the full $375 - or even $300 for a normal pair however, I’m not so sure. They’re fantastic, but with them being priced so far above their competition, I definitely wouldn’t have bought them if they weren’t on sale. For the general consumer though, I think they’re a “buy on sale” set of earbuds just because of the price despite how good they are. However, if you happen to be rather wealthy and aren’t so concerned about price, they’re 100% worth grabbing. \n\n**Overall: I love them.** I strongly recommend grabbing them if you’re looking for a pair of open ears (or even in ears). It also doesn’t hurt that they’re rather stylish and kinda look like an ear ring. They sound great, feel great, work great, and stay in your ears great. The price is high, so I’d say wait for a sale if you’re more financially constrained, but if you‘re not, definitely grab them. ",

I wasn't really tampering with any part of it, but just keeping the speakers rotated flat in the case (required given that it's not the biggest case) which must have resulted in the plastic joint breaking off. Soon it just came off really loose and ended in the right speaker separating\n\nThis really has me distrusting plastic headphones, so i'm not gonna take those anymore.

    "selftext": "I tried them at e-earphones today while on vacation in Japan.\n\nThey’re decent commuter headphones but I think how good they are is significantly overblown by folks like DMS and Jake from LTT.  They’re a leg up over XM6s but they’re still pretty closed-in sounding and misses the mark on airiness and imaging.\n\nAre they the best closed ANC over the ears today?  Yeah, probably.  Are they significantly better in audio quality over the APP2/3 to justify the bulk?  No, IMO and their ANC is still leagues behind the APP3 and has the feeling of “pressurized” ANC that the XM3/XM4 has.  The default tuning is also very bass heavy, not even close to neutral — I find it surprising that the same reviewers that complained about the bassiness of the APP3 applaud the default tuning of the HDB630s considering it has the same bass bloat without EQ enabled.\n\nWould I replace the HD650s with them?  Not a chance.  They sound way more realistic in its imaging and sound staging, and while you can EQ it similarly, you can’t EQ away the fact that it’s still a closed back headphone.\n\nDid Sennheiser disrupt the market with these headphones?  Yes, the USB-C dongle and built in PEQ is amazing and should be the default for all TWS headphones.  But the amount of overhype and shilling by prominent YT reviewers is pretty gross IMO — comparing it to HE-1s and saying it makes everything else redundant?  Misguided at best and malicious at worst.\n\nI personally would just stick with my APP3s for on the go use… and definitely keeping my HD650s/HD800S (and IMO the HD800 secondhand is a way better bargain than this unless you actually need TWS/ANC)\n\nFWIW — currently use APP2/3, HD650/HD800S/ES-2a/X9000 and have owned XM3-XM5 in the past as well as almost all of the TOTLs back in the early 2000s including HE90/SR-O/Qualia.  So was really looking forward to a true game changer but IMO this ain’t it.  It is at best an incremental improvement over other TWS IMO",

    "selftext": "I had a pair of Momentum 2s from 2018 to 2025.\n\nI loved them. They were firm, reliable, had reasonable microphone quality for phone calls, and fitted on my head perfectly. They were a little uncomfortable if I wore them for upwards of 6 hours, but they were otherwise perfect. I liked how they looked and how they fitted on my ears. I was very happy with the adjustments you could make on them, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the power port began to die a few months ago, and they no longer reliably charged. I cannot buy the 2s again, so I decided to go with the 4s. I purchased them in July 2025. It has now been around 3 months.\n\nAnd I... do not like them.\n\nThey look boring and corporate. I thought I would get used to the style but there is no style. They just look the same as everybody else's and I find that unappealing.\n\nThey are comfortable. But the adjustments do not stick - if I make the cups closer to the headband, they will slowly slide down over the course of hours. I will have to adjust them constantly. They feel less secure than the 2s. If I bend down, they slide off and this is useless as a main pair of headphones that I want for wandering around the house and at work. Unloading the dishwasher is impossible while wearing them.\n\nThe touch panels on the cups are the worst thing known to man. I have to turn them off otherwise every time I adjust my hair or the headphones, it would skip a song or pause it or change the volume. I also dislike that I have to redo this setting every time I use them - it should stay off when I ask it to and not try to turn on again.\n\nI hate the 'readiness detector' function where it will know if I have taken them off etc. When I want to turn my headphones off, I do not want to argue with them. Sometimes, I wear them with no sound when I am travelling because it can be so noisy in airports etc. It *insists* on overriding whatever I am doing so I also have to turn off that function.\n\nIt will not stop trying to connect. I have to physically turn the headphones off or it will just decide to reconnect when my phone is nearby even if it is playing music out loud. I should be able to choose where I want a phone call to come out of. \n\nI do not like having an app for my headphones. I knew it when I bought them, and it is adequate but I find I do not care to tinker with my headphones and I do not like it is yet another thing I need my phone for within arms reach.\n\nTurning them on and off is annoying. I have to press and hold for too long, and it sometimes does not work. They often will turn themselves back on when my phone is back in reach which is annoying. I do not want my devices doing what they think.\n\nThe sound quality is fine. Just fine. Nothing remarkable. The battery life is good. I like the USB C. I like the fast charging aspect of them. \n\nI just... feel very disappointed and like I could have purchased headphones for half the price and got something much better. I liked my Momentums 2 so much, and would happily go back to them in a heartbeat.",

    "selftext": "There seem to be infinite claims about these headphones. From zeos claiming they need a 50W per channel speaker amp to sound good (lmao) to more reasonable claims.\n\nThis is the YouTube video that basically summarizes all the research and points iv heard online:\n\n[https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE](https://youtu.be/JpqnGbP9aTo?si=ujWnlIFBqKdppgaE)\n\nOne claim iv heard a lot has to do with amp output impedance and damping factor. I had never heard about these 2 things in much detail prior to researching these headphones. I thought lower amp output impedance is always better but according to many people online, you want an amplifiers output impedance to be about 1/8 of the headphones impedance due to the damping factor or something. I don’t really understand this or what it means so if anyone has knowledge on this I would really appreciate some help understanding. Or this is a completely fraudulent claim, please let me know of that as well.\n\nBasically based on this, many have claimed that to make high impedance cans like the 880/990 600 ohm sound good, you need an amp with about 90-100 output impedance. I am not a professional nor am i particularly well versed in the technical aspects of audio. So I have ZERO clue if this claim and the corollary behind it have any real validity and would love some real professionals opinions on this.\n\nI have an atom amp+ which has an exceptionally low output impedance of less than 1 ohm. Would using an IEM impedance adapter be equivalent to having a headphone amp with a higher output impedance? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI really would appreciate any insights you guys have into these topics. Thanks!",

After 4–5 years of use, the battery isn’t as strong, and I’ve had to replace the pads twice. The back of the headphones is plastic and has picked up a few scratches over time.\n\nThese days I use headphones every day for commuting, work, and workouts, so I’ve been trying different models recently. After testing ones from Bose, Sony, Skullcandy, and Baseus, I’ve been using the XH1 a lot. The sound feels reliable, the tuning gives a nice balanced tone, and the battery life lasts longer than most I’ve tried, which I really appreciate.\n\nCompared with the XM3, the ANC feels stronger in noisy places, and the bass is punchier even without EQ. It also folds easily, and the ear pads are soft and comfy. I’m not an expert, but it’s been a solid experience overall. ",

That being said, the design wasn’t my favorite. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack location felt awkward, the rotation limiter that attaches on the side felt like an afterthought, and the driver cap, although unique, looked a little weird. \n\nTaking some not-so-subtle design cues from the Dahlia and Tungsten, this was my attempt to solve all those aesthetic issues. Internally, the cups are pretty much identical. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack is now located towards the back of your head, letting the cable drape down. It also doubles as the rotation limiter. The driver cap is now a  swappable faceplate, which (hopefully) shouldn’t affect the sound too much. \n\nThere are definitely some tweaks I want to make though before wiring these up for a test drive. I’d like to make the face plate more open, and make the side walls a little thicker. The face plate is also currently designed for screws. Id like to eventually make them attach via magnets. \n\nLet me know what yall think, or if you have any predictions on how great, or terribly awful, they’ll sound lol",

Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones’ headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden’s Run to the Hills. The app’s EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The “Hell Blocker” noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger.

    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

I found these HiFi For All stands (pictured) which are affordable, and solve the problem, but I would prefer one with a bit of a longer headband area (vs just wide depth-wise). Like the ones on Gadgetry’s vids - there is one that has a little knob that looks like it is for length adjustment that looks nice too, but I can’t find it on the net. (Third picture, from his Aune AR5000 review, sorry for blurriness).\n\nI am thinking there must be some hidden gems out there that are reasonable affordable, and available in the US sans tariff/import fees, preferably.",

I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI AM DESPERATE!!! 🥲\n\nI really need help EQ’ing my DT 770 PRO X (not the limited edition) for Warzone.\n\nFor music they’re absolutely fantastic – I love them.\nBut for Warzone they are almost unplayable for me. Everything loud (explosions, ambience, gunfire, airstrikes etc.) is overly forward, while footsteps are very hard to pick up. After a full month of trying to adapt, it still feels wrong.\n\nI’ve already watched the well-known EQ videos on YouTube, searched Reddit threads, tried EQ from GPT suggestions and used Sonar / PEACE to do EQ! \n\nBut I still can’t get good game experience. 😂😭\n\nAt this point I’m honestly desperate!! I’m even willing to pay someone if they can help me get a working EQ preset for competitive play. 🙏\n\nIf anyone has a tried-and-tested Warzone EQ for the DT 770 PRO X (48 ohm) specifically — or knows what frequencies need to be reduced/boosted for footstep clarity on this model — I would be extremely grateful.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn’t that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don’t have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I’ve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don’t I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars).

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 Quick Impressions",
    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

I never had a issue with the XS comfort either, but the Arya's feel so far more comfortable.\n\nThe sound is such an upgrade. Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger. Well couldn't help it for £585 open box directly from Hifiman and comes with standard warranty 👌🏿. ",

    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

The imaging is really good and the sound stage is excellent for a closed back. They also sound very good in the music and movie department but I can’t see myself using them for that when I have the 650’s within arm’s reach. ",

To be fair, this is the most expensive set of headphones I have ever had, but the ones I've tested in stores (sony WH-1000XM5, beats studio pro, sony WH-1000XM4, Anker space one, apple airpods max) are \\*OVERALL\\* worse for me. the sound isnt as good as some other headphones, but these headphones are so comfortable and the ANC is so powerful I dont really mind the audio quality loss.

I have seen some really nice stands on vids by Resolve (a Focal stand) and GadgetryTech (forget the brand), but those are $250-$500, more than I want to pay for a stand. I found these HiFi For All stands (pictured) which are affordable, and solve the problem, but I would prefer one with a bit of a longer headband area (vs just wide depth-wise). Like the ones on Gadgetry’s vids - there is one that has a little knob that looks like it is for length adjustment that looks nice too, but I can’t find it on the net. (Third picture, from his Aune AR5000 review, sorry for blurriness).\n\nI am thinking there must be some hidden gems out there that are reasonable affordable, and available in the US sans tariff/import fees, preferably.",

    "selftext": "**source:** tidal or personal flac files through bluetooth aptx\n\n**FIT:**\n\nHDB 630 - very comfortable but loosest of the bunch. felt a bit insecure. if l looked up or shook my head I had that feeling they may fall off. smaller ear cups too if you're concern about that and I could feel contact with my ears but nothing uncomfortable for me.\n\nPX7 S3 - slightly more clamping force which got a little uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. best seal out of the bunch so pick your poison.\n\nPx8 S2 - most comfortable. not too tight, not too loose. just right on my head. doesn't feel insecure.\n\n**BUILD QUALITY:**\n\nHDB 630 - decent. I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

Droolworthy bass + sub bass. OK soundstage/imaging.

Meh bass. OK soundstage/imaging. Boring.\n\n3.) **Beyerdynamic TYGR 300R**:\n\nI've had a couple Beyers in the past and used to daily a modded set of DT770/250ohm. I found the DT880s and DT990s too sibilant, more so with the former.\n\nInsanely comfortable. Awesome bass + sub bass (FT1 pro is better), droolworthy soundstage/imaging.\n\nI cannot believe the things I am hearing in music and while playing BF6, I can pinpoint instruments and gunshots in any direction like I'm right there. All of this and no Beyer sibilance? absolutely brilliant.\n\nThese headphones are damn near perfect for my use case while being sensitive to higher frequencies.

I’m even willing to pay someone if they can help me get a working EQ preset for competitive play. 🙏\n\nIf anyone has a tried-and-tested Warzone EQ for the DT 770 PRO X (48 ohm) specifically — or knows what frequencies need to be reduced/boosted for footstep clarity on this model — I would be extremely grateful.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

While it works for the most part, I want to be able to switch to a different tab and access other things on my deck at the same time. I set up controls in the controller settings so that holding r5 is alt+tab and double tapping the menu button is windows specifically for helldivers. However it doesn't work, I get the haptic feedback but nothing else happens. I'm also having an issue where the trackpad doesn't work in the overlay mode while on a game. Both of these issues are fixed if I attach a mouse and keyboard via the dock, but I'm wanting to play this handheld. I have already tried a few things, like trying different bindings, running steam as administrator and messing around with the controller settings.\n\nDoes anyone know a solution to these issues? ",

Works normally even on sleep mode and gameplay. But of course, slow charging.\n\n- resetted the EC Controller I believe.

Result: Still not working correctly\n\n\n- completely shutting down > connects charger to work > boots up  while charging > reconnect charger. Result: It doesnt charge anymore when I reconnect the charger.\n\n\nI don't know if there is an issue with power delivery controller or what. Or an issue with the charging port now.\n\nAppreciate any tips or advice. Thank u",

I managed to mod it there, then I got my steam deck a few years later and also managed to mod it there, though I believe in a different way. I want to mod and play it again on steam deck but I can’t remember how I modded it for the steam deck. \n\nI’ve tried, manually downloading the mods on Vortex to the same folder as the mods that worked, also opening them with PeaZip that I seem to have done with the other mods? But none of the new mods are working. The game still runs, there’s just no effect (it should be there from the start, e.g. sprinting). \n\nShould I just delete all the mods I have for the game and start new using a system I know?

How long will my steam deck function with absolutely no possibility of internet access for verification?",

I know you can get MakeMKV integrated with VLC in Debian linux but what’s the outlook for Arch? Not interested in ripping, I just want to be able to play my discs with my external Bluray drive.",

Noticed the battery dropped to 71%. I decided to go charge it. Left it for 30 minutes and it remained at 71%. Got my power bank that outputs up to 65W. And the voltage reading was 15V(normal) and amps at 0.2-0.5A. Decided to use my UPS to use the stock charger and observed the same wattage around 3 to 8 wattage. As soon I put the steam deck to sleep mode, the ampage went to zero.  \n\nWent to the repair shop to hopefully get it fixed but as I was demonstrating my issue using my power bank the ampage read 2.2A at 15V. They humored me and took to investigate but they had no issue charging it. I retrieve the steam deck the following day. \n\nI attempted to charge it and it did charge like normal. I decided to play for about 2 hours and the battery dropped to 68%. I decided to charge one more time and again it does not charge. Same issue I had prior to going back to the repair shop.\n\nMade a ticket with Valve to see if they could come up with a solution \n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue?\n",

    "selftext": "I’ve been running into a few games recently that are listed as *Playable* on Steam Deck, but in practice they crash often or struggle to stay above 30 FPS. It feels misleading when something that clearly doesn’t run well still gets that label.\n\nI understand that *Verified* is meant for perfect compatibility, but *Playable* should still mean it’s a smooth, stable experience, not “it launches and sort of works.”\n\nIn my opinion, for a game to be marked *Playable* on Deck, it should:  \n• Run without crashes or freezes  \n• Hold a consistent 60 FPS or at least maintain stable performance  \n• Have controls and UI that work properly without major tweaks\n\nIf it can’t meet those basic standards, it should really just be marked as *Unsupported*. Right now, the label feels too generous and doesn’t match the actual experience.\n\nThis matters because people are making purchase decisions based on these labels. If a game is marked *Playable*, most users will assume it runs decently out of the box — not that it’ll crash or run at half the expected frame rate.\n\nWhat do you all think? Should Valve tighten the criteria for what counts as *Playable* on Deck?",

I followed everything in the GitHub step by step this means my Stardew Valley (SV) has to be intalled in Windows through Proton Experimental. So I uninstalled mine, set its compatibility to PE before installing it again.\n\n2. I went to the Manual Patching through Gaming Mode, selected SV as the game, and selected OpenGL.\n\n3. I installed Natural Color ReShade from Nexusmods (link: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1213) extracted it, copied its files and had put it into my SV game files. \n\n4. I then opened the folder and found its .fx files through steamapps/common/Stardew Valley/reshade-shaders--->(this was the contents of the Natural Color reshade I downloaded)/Shaders which I then copied it and pasted it to my .local/share/reshade/External_reshade folder.\n\nI'm not sure if I did something wrong from the steps above and if I did please let me know.\n\nI alao tried to tinker with it hoping it might actually work so what I did was I copied the contents of the Natural Color ReShade and pasted it to .local/share/reshade/ReShade_shaders folder but it still did not work.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I recently got a Steam Deck and I'm having a bit of a problem when I try playing Human Revolution. The problem is that the UI of Human Revolution doesn't natively support resolutions higher than 720p and that makes the text blurry and of low quality. So I used the steps on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/196xlw3/4k_ui_scaling_fix_deus_ex_human_revolution/) Reddit post and got the game running. I guess it worked one or two times during my more than 10 attempts. After some trial and error I found out the modification works just fine on desktop mode, but whenever I switch back to the game mode it doesn't work. \n\n  \nFor clarification I updated the .exe file of the game for both Steam files on .local and .steam. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any advice for me to try. Thanks in advance for your time and help. ",

    "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nSo, I'm writing this post because I'm experiencing some wonkiness with my right trigger button being triggered when I haven't touched it... and I'm not sure if it's a system-wide issue or if it's a game-specific issue. Though, it has been persisting across two games in particular: Saints Row 3 and Saints Row 4. Specifically, when I get out of certain states (like, when I go to Friendly Fire or exit pause or boot the game up), my weapon fires in spite of the RT button not being pressed. Additionally, for some missions, when I actually do hit RT to try to fire the weapon - it doesn't fire... and the workaround I've found is to hit the Steam button to pause the game and then restart it so that the weapon will fire upon leaving pause.\n\nNow, I have made a couple of aftermarket alterations to what's inside the deck - most notably, changing out the joysticks and installing a kit to make the buttons more clicky. Also, I stuck an AirTag in my Steam Deck because after having left my Steam Deck on a plane in Vancouver (shoutout to Air North, whose staff were able to get my Steam Deck back to me same day). So, I'm wondering if I fucked up my right trigger button through my alterations, or if this is just a bug with these two Saints Row games. I saw nothing about the games on ProtonDB.",

The seem to be very lose compared to what I am used to. I am not sure if it is the tension they are distend with or if they are taller than other controllers I use (PS5 dual sense, joycon, switch 2 pro controller). Those have a consistent feel to them but these seem quite a bit different. I wanted to see what the community consensus is. \n\nAlso weird thing first game I played was Lumines arise demo (can’t wait for full game) then Hades 2 then Pac-Man championship edition. When I went to launch packman it asked if I wanted to close hades 2. I clicked yes and then it got hung loading Pac-Man. I then found that in addition to hades 2 being open lumines was still open. What I am missing? I am used to switch 2 only having one game open at a time. (Still impressive hades 2 ran so well with another game in the background). ",

But I have uninstalled decky loader, it didn't work, I also manually uninstalled the plugins and it didn't work either and finally I've also did a complete reboot with all my datas wipe just in case and the issue is still here.\n\nSomeone has a solution ? I've looked on internet but no one seems to have the solution or a similar problem to mine. I've uploaded a video to show it to you (sorry for the poor quality)\n\n\nEdit : I also tried to completely uninstall decky and playing with the plugin I had uninstalled before the bug with a switch to Steam beta and stable and the other way around but it doesn't change anything. My main guess at this point is that after a Steam update it has messed up decky which has completely overrided the steam and ... Buttons on the space button and deactivated Y. So if anyone can help I'd be more than thankfull.\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1of8xw0/video/i4xc5lyjg4xf1/player\n\n  \n",

The kit came with all of the screws bunched together, which made it difficult to figure out which went where. This took up at least half an hour of my time and I feel like it would be so easy to add that to there guild. Along with this, I actually broke a couple of posts while installing the hardware. While this isn't a huge deal and, from I hear its common, I feel like this happens because the whole kit can fit so tightly together that at times you need to use force to get some of the pieces in place \n\nOver all though im satisfied with the end result but I dont think i can recommend this, especially for a beginner",

I can send more details if interested.\n\nIf you want to install it on the deck go to linux desktop, download the game on moddb  https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/downloads/stalker-anomaly-153\n\n and follow this guide:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/s/Q07ZwMx0S3\nAfter that you can launch the game through steam and choose your compatibility layer and controls.\n\nI can share my control layout as well.\n\n It doesn't have native controller support but The steam controller input allows to double or triple bind controls/keys and the trackpad works great as mouse! \n\nPlayed the game about 20 hours now and it crashed 3 times, but that's it. \n\nHave fun!\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI got a stylthgrip case and for the life of me I couldn’t get the ryze sticks on correctly. In trying to get them on, I kind of “twisted” the actual steam left joystick and it became incredibly stiff. I was convinced I had to return to valve. I then gently rotated it the other way and it worked again. If I touch the joystick, it just seems to wobble in a way the right doesn’t. It doesn’t seem to affect gameplay in any noticeable way, but it doesn’t make a slightly different sound when I touch the stick as opposed to the right. Has this happened to anyone else?\n",

I set up controls in the controller settings so that holding r5 is alt+tab and double tapping the menu button is windows specifically for helldivers. However it doesn't work, I get the haptic feedback but nothing else happens. I'm also having an issue where the trackpad doesn't work in the overlay mode while on a game. Both of these issues are fixed if I attach a mouse and keyboard via the dock, but I'm wanting to play this handheld. I have already tried a few things, like trying different bindings, running steam as administrator and messing around with the controller settings.\n\nDoes anyone know a solution to these issues? ",

Lossless Scaling wasn't a perfect experience and I know it's not magic, but it did feel a lot better in RDR2 compared to 30fps. \n\nThat being said, i'm looking for another game to sink time into. Death Stranding and Cyberpunk 2077 are what i'm looking at the most. I know that both games don't run perfect, but a lot of people praise them on the Deck. \n\nWhat game is a better experience? In terms of stability, battery, fan noise, graphical fidelity, and compatibility with Lossless Scaling? \n\nI can adjust to minor lag spikes, as long as they're in isolated scenes or areas and don't occur regularly in the game world.",

Works normally even on sleep mode and gameplay. But of course, slow charging.\n\n- resetted the EC Controller I believe. The thing where yung press and hold the volume up and the power button when turned off and then after the light blinks, connect charger. Result: Still not working correctly\n\n\n- completely shutting down > connects charger to work > boots up  while charging > reconnect charger. Result: It doesnt charge anymore when I reconnect the charger.\n\n\nI don't know if there is an issue with power delivery controller or what. Or an issue with the charging port now.\n\nAppreciate any tips or advice. Thank u",

Ideally, I’d like to avoid having several different hubs.\n\nI noticed that the new Echo Dot Max has a built-in smart hub supporting Zigbee, Matter, and Thread Border Router.\nIf I understand correctly, does this mean I wouldn’t need any additional hubs, and I could connect different Zigbee or Matter devices directly to Alexa?\n\nIs the Echo Dot Max good choice as smart home hub? Is Alexa a good choice for simple automation setups?\n\nWhich protocol would you recommend — Matter, Zigbee?\n\nAny recommendations for socket relays and motion/presence sensors that work well with Alexa?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips or personal experiences!",

And I do still want to be safety minded for any risks there might be for things like that. But I'm also going through a lot of big life changes right now that having a little help from an at home assistant type device would be super helpful where I can just tell it a thing and it will remind me or add it to other devices and stuff like that. I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup?

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "UK based and house with no neutrals. \n\nSo currently I have a 1 gang light switch which is permentantly on so that I can control the Tapo smart bulb via voice or HA. However, I was wondering (I don't mind purchasing equipment) if it's possible to replace the dumb 1 gang and replace with a smart 2 gang. The 1st light switch would activate the ceiling light (which I would change to a dumb bulb) unless of course there's a smart switch and bulb that work together but my understanding is there isn't?\n\nThe 2nd switch would activate the under counter LED strip (Yet to install). \n\nIs something like this possible at all?",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

RAK19003 base is 30x35mm, you just have to fit the LIR2032 3.7V coin battery and make sure all components are rated for at least 70C.",

Ordering from abroad would take months and be quite expensive.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about using four regular digital pressure gauges instead. My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

Cars pull into the wrong driveway, random animals wander near the fence line, and sometimes packages get left at weird spots around the yard. Nothing major I know, but enough to make me want to help them keep an eye on things without turning their place into Fort Knox.\n\nLets bring back, here’s the thing: I am now thinking of installing a camera system in their garden to make sure their efforts under surveilliance, they are happy to accept that, however, my parents are not tech people, they don’t want anything complicated, especially no local servers, no wired systems, no monthly fees. Ideally, I’d like to find a battery-powered smart camera that’s easy to set up (literally just mount and go), doesn’t need wiring, and can tell the difference between people, cars, and animals.\n\nBasically, something simple enough for them to use, and smart enough that I can check in remotely to make sure everything’s fine when they’re not home.\n\nSo that’s what I’m looking for: a lightweight, intelligent surveillance solution for a house or small farm.\n\nAnyone here using something similar?

    "selftext": "Hi all — hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI’ve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won’t be an issue — my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t•\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30×1.5?\n\t•\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss→M30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you’ve used?\n\nWhat I’ve tried / extra info:\n\t•\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay…).\n\t•\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don’t seat correctly on several valves.\n\t•\tI’m fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t•\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t•\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t•\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t•\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t•\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t•\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t•\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey — I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. 🙏\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can’t figure out the chart :(",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! 😊)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It’s not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn’t want to give up gardening—especially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations — this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier’s water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125–250 m³/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot – all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 – 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I’m Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it’s possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I’d love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I’m really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I’m planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant’s growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. „This is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?“\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can’t physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It’s not overkill—it’s my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. „This must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?“\r\n-\tYou’re right, it does. This isn’t about saving money; it’s about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. „Is it still ‚growing‘ if everything is automated?“\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn’t just manual labor—it’s responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. „What happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?“\r\n-\tGreat question. That’s why I’m already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. „Why go public with something like this?“\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it’s possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. „Why not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?“\r\n-\tFor many, that’s a great option—but not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can’t reach into the tent. It’s not about convenience; it’s a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. „Do you have any pictures of the build process itself?“\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things—the automation, the code, and making it accessible—that we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚build‘ for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I’ll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. „How do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn’t the power draw a major issue?“\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot—a task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7–4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn’t just inconvenient—it could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like „overkill“ to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn’t replace my involvement—it’s what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I’m happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I’m severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn’t about being lazy; it’s about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

Props to them for doing the right thing. They not only created a solid product but they also made sure that the end user would be able to use the product without having to buy another battery from zooz. \n\nI know it’s stupid but this has made a loyal customer out of me and I deeply respect this company. \n",

So I know it’s not an issue with my hub. \n\nWhat’s causing these issues? These smart plug brands have hundreds of reviews on Amazon. I can’t be the only one running into a bug like this?

Ideally, I’d like to avoid having several different hubs.\n\nI noticed that the new Echo Dot Max has a built-in smart hub supporting Zigbee, Matter, and Thread Border Router.\nIf I understand correctly, does this mean I wouldn’t need any additional hubs, and I could connect different Zigbee or Matter devices directly to Alexa?\n\nIs the Echo Dot Max good choice as smart home hub? Is Alexa a good choice for simple automation setups?\n\nWhich protocol would you recommend — Matter, Zigbee?\n\nAny recommendations for socket relays and motion/presence sensors that work well with Alexa?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips or personal experiences!",

I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m setting up automation in my new apartment (about 65 sqm) and would love some advice on where to start.\n\nMy plan is quite simple — I’d like to have:\n- A couple of smart socket relays\n- A few motion/presence sensors\n- Automated curtains (I’ll use Somfy for that)\n\nI don’t want anything too complex like Home Assistant, since I won’t have too many scenes or devices. Ideally, I’d like to avoid having several different hubs.\n\nI noticed that the new Echo Dot Max has a built-in smart hub supporting Zigbee, Matter, and Thread Border Router.\nIf I understand correctly, does this mean I wouldn’t need any additional hubs, and I could connect different Zigbee or Matter devices directly to Alexa?\n\nIs the Echo Dot Max good choice as smart home hub? Is Alexa a good choice for simple automation setups?\n\nWhich protocol would you recommend — Matter, Zigbee?\n\nAny recommendations for socket relays and motion/presence sensors that work well with Alexa?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips or personal experiences!",

They run on Matter, so all my automations and app controls continued locally without any interruption.\n\nIt was honestly the first time I noticed how much difference Matter makes. Even when cloud services go down, my smart blinds still work as if nothing happened.\n\nAnyone else here with Matter devices that stayed online during the outage? Curious to hear how your setups handled it!",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

(Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system. (Where I can do the normal stuff already when moving into the house)\n\nThanks for your advice!\n",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I know it’s not the most secure option, but honestly, having a remote lying around in the driveway isn’t great either.\n\nI’m looking for a simple, weather-resistant (lots of rain) fingerprint reader that can be managed directly on the device, via a web interface, or through an app. Ideally, it should also integrate with Home Assistant.\n\nThere are a lot of Chinese models on the market, but it’s hard to tell which ones are reliable. I’ve looked into Anviz. The P7 is still available locally but seems to be EOL, and the C2 Slim appears to be out of stock everywhere.\n\nDoes anyone have other suggestions or recommendations for specific models?\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

But when I tried to use the DIY function where I physically put the remote up to the IR blaster so it can read the signal outputted by the remote so that it can read that signal and out put it itself, it doesn't work but when I tried the remote on the ac itself it does work. AC doesnt support a wifi function so it won't work with the TCL home app. The Smart IR blaster is an OEM tuya remote. \n\nI first tried to consult this to an AI model but it said that remotes often transmit a long code containing temperature, modes and whatnot and that the IR receiver of the blaster might not be picking that long code and only picking up a quick bit of it. Then it just said to bring this up to a community so here I am. I think my problem might not be with TCL but that I'm trying to use an AC",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nAfter years of saying I’d never get into the whole smarthome thing (“I can just get off the couch and turn on the lights myself”), I’ve finally caved.  \nUp until now, my only smart device was my robot vacuum — *Consuela* — but it’s time for something new.\n\nI want to build a **wake-up light** setup in my bedroom that can also double as extra lighting during the darker winter months.\n\n**The plan:**  \nI’m thinking of installing a **4–5 meter LED strip** between the edge of my dropped ceiling and my curtains, using an L-profile so the light shines down and bounces softly off the curtains. Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

It wouldnt come on. It was the middle of the night, so i took it to a place to fix it. It was a good place, enough people recommend it and it wasnt expensive. They fixed it so the screen would turn on, but it wouldnt turn on unless it was plugged in. They didnt tell me this, i just found out when i got home and tried to use it. I didn't have time to go back (it was finals week in college) and when i finally had time, i just forgot and didnt have enough money if they tried to charge me again.\n\nFast forward, I haven't used it much because of always needing to be plugged in, and its needed a few updates for a while. Still works fine for most stuff, just some games are starting to get slow.\n\nNow, i cant update the laptop because the \"battery is too low\" and I \"need to plug in my computer\", is what it tells me, but the computer is alway plugged because it won't turn on otherwise, except the computer doesn't register as being plugged in because the battery is basically always at 0% and just using exactly the charge it needs to run and none to save.\n\nI have a Microsoft Surface Laptop 4. Its only 4yrs old, so i definitely dont want another yet.\n\nDo you think it's fixable and maybe how much? Is there anything else I can do to update it without having to fix it? I haven't called the repair place yet, but i might when i have time / money to spair. I can only take it to one place to repair because it requires special tools to open and no one else around here has them.",

And it's not that our wi-fi is getting overloaded or anything because whenever our roommate is home alone it still goes out on her. It goes out without fail literally every single time she uses her laptop. I think it's only when she uses her laptop, not her phone.

She's had two different laptop since we moved in and it happens with both of them.\n\nI know it sounds crazy but what could possibly be the explanation here?\n\n  \nETA: we don't honestly have too many devices plugged into wi-fi at once.

It was/is with no issues at all. But as soon as I connect my phone to wifi, FUBO content stops working. While connected to wifi, the app will load and I can see all current live content available to stream but when I try to stream it, it doesn't load. I also noticed that while I am on wifi, I can't access AT&T's SmartHomeManager iPhone app but as soon as I disconnect from wifi, I can. \n\nI checked other content on my AppleTV. YouTube and HBO work with no problems. Disney, Prime, ESPN, and a lot of other apps will not load any content. This tells me that there is something wrong with accessing only certain content through my wifi. \n\nI have restarted my modem, router, and all content devices. I also made sure all my devices have the most recent software updates completed. Problem persists. \n\nThen I tried the content on my MacBook. Same issue. The same content will not load on any browser that I try and gives the message \"This site can’t be reached. Check if there is a typo. DNS\\_PROBE\\_FINISHED\\_NXDOMAIN).\n\nI have had the same ISP, router, and devices for 6 months with zero problems at all. I've tried everything that I can think of to resolve the issue but nothing is working. I tried contacting AT&T support but that was a complete waste of time. \n\nAny thoughts on what might be happening here and how I can resolve the issue?\n\n",

My discord and instagram hack was from, who I assume, was the same guy as it was spamming everyone with messages for some Kai Cenat cryptop scam, even posting on my instagram story and posts. My steam renamed my profile and changed my pfp to some russian name and editted Jenna Ortega picture. I think my email was compromised too as it had extra devices attached to it but they were from my country and state so I could either be getting paranoid and got it wrong or someone's either local or using some vpn/spoofing tool.

    "selftext": "Hello folks,\n\nMy MSI GF63 Thin 10UC-607IN has been with me for nearly 4 years now and I've had this issue for a year where the Wi-Fi card randomly disables itself (often under heavy load) and shows up with an error in Device Manager which I have attributed to power issues. To compensate for this, I've been using an Ethernet connection as it worked fine with no issues - that is up until yesterday. \n\nYesterday, I plugged in the Ethernet cable as usual and suddenly it's no longer recognized by the system. Nothing lights up on the router, connections doesn't even show an ethernet cable plugged in. I have ruled out router and cable issues after it worked fine with another laptop but mine won't even recognize the cable plugged in. Device Manager shows the Ethernet controller and reports everything as normal but it can't recognize any connections at all. I've tried a CMOS reset, driver update, device reboot, hard reboot, BIOS update and nothing worked. I've no idea what triggered this, I'm completely lost on a solution to this issue. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'll answer any queries to the best of my abilities to identify the issue/cause.\n\nThanks!",

Never mishandled it. Minor scratching on the display backside (side facing outward) due to an accident.\n\nProblem desc:- Yesterday on 24 Oct I started using it like usual in the morning. Later I put it to sleep by closing the lid to go eat. After putting it to sleep I opened it after 30 minutes or so, and it wouldn't turn back on\n\nHe keyboard lights were \"breathing\" like usual in sleep mode but when I gave inputs it never came back on.\n\nSo I did a force shutdown and restarted it, it took noticeably longer to do so. I tried to start it again and it booted but it froze midway while I was looking at event viewer logs.\n\nThis continued 2 times and again once in safemode. After this I tried resetting my bios and the usual stuff. For somereason after this, when I booted back into safe mode it froze and gave a bluescreen this time.\n\nStop code: 0x9C. I will attach picture of verbose info later as soon I can find the image.\n\nNow the computer doesn't even boot to UEFI or show the Asus splash screen. It just starts and keyboard cycles through colors and it doesn't spin fans or anything.\n\nTried opening it up, cleaning, checking DIMM slots and even repasted the cpu (for somereason i thought I may help)\n\nWhat to do?\n",

    "selftext": "I’m losing my mind over this. I’ve spent days trying to figure out why my RTX 3060 Laptop GPU won’t initialize properly on my Acer Nitro 5 AN515-57 (Windows 11 build 26100). Everything looks fine on the surface - the GPU is physically present, drivers are installed, Device Manager shows it as “Started,” DevManView confirms PCI activity, and yet… Windows refuses to load the graphics stack.\n\nHere’s what I’ve found:\n\n- `dxgkrnl.sys` shows up as BOOTLOG_NOT_LOADED in `ntbtlog.txt`, twice.\n- `dxgmms2.sys` and `nvlddmkm.sys` don’t appear in the log at all — meaning Windows isn’t even trying to load the NVIDIA kernel driver or DirectX memory manager.\n- I’ve tried multiple NVIDIA drivers (latest, older, clean uninstall with DDU, manual INF install). No change.\n- BIOS is locked down. Acer used to offer BIOS 1.25 and 1.27, but now only 1.20 is available (at least here in France). \nNo GPU mode toggle, no Advanced tab, no way to force dGPU.\n- WinDbg won’t attach to the kernel — throws `0x80004001` (function not implemented). \nTurns out Windows 11 blocks local kernel debugging unless Secure Boot, VBS, and HVCI are disabled. I’m not nuking my security stack just to get a trace.\n- Boot logging confirms that everything else loads — USB, storage, AppLocker filters — but not the graphics stack.\n- INF file is `oem0.inf` from Acer. I tried replacing it with clean `nv_dispig.inf` from NVIDIA - still no DXGI activation.\n- Event Viewer doesn’t show any driver load errors. No BSODs. No device failures.\n\nThe GPU is there. The driver is there. But Windows refuses to treat it as a usable graphics device. My guess is that EC or ACPI isn’t passing the GPU to DXGI properly. Maybe it’s stuck in hybrid mode. Maybe the firmware is blocking it. I don’t know anymore.\n\nI considered modding the BIOS to unlock the Advanced tab and force dGPU mode. Or using RU.efi or setup_var to flip hidden NVRAM flags. But I’m exhausted. I’ve done everything short of flashing a modded BIOS or patching ACPI tables manually. I beg you, someone help me, i don't even wanna play CS2 anymore, i want this to be over. ",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI sincerely appreciate any insight or help you guys can provide. My PC is screwed and I'm not sure if I need to buy a new GPU, a new processor, or what.\n\nInitial problem: my computer does not wake from sleep. The screen stays black. I changed my settings to never sleep so it fixed this issue but I still get problems. For example, if I restart my PC, I get a black screen. If I update my graphics driver (causes your display to flash and turn black briefly), it will cause the screen to go and stay black. Once this happens, the screen stays black no matter how many times I restart or cycle. Everything is running in the background properly (I’m able to enter my passcode and log in and I hear the windows startup chime, the screen just stays black. Also hear games running). windows + shift + ctrl + b does not help. Attempting to drain residual power doesn’t seem to help. The ONLY thing that works is turning off my PC and leaving it to sit at least 12-15 minutes before powering back on. From this point, the screen \\*usually\\* posts successfully. This issue is stopping me from being able to do other things like update graphics drivers, check disc command, safe mode, etc. which is related to problem 2. \n\nproblem 2: My computer has begun to crash recently. In reliability checker it’s saying there’s a failed shutdown along with Microsoft game input being reconfigured successfully. Uninstalling gameinput doesn't seem to fix the issue. However, now the PC black screens and restarts when opening any game much worse than before and now also while simple usage (crashed with both wow and hearthstone… haven’t tried steam yet).  Each time this happens, I need to wait like 15 minutes before I’m able to get back in due to the black screen issue. The CPU mobo light flashes during these crashes. \n\n**What I tried (in order):**\n\n\\-SFC scan. Returned no errors.\n\n\\-DSIM restore.\n\n\\-Check disc find and fix commands. Did this once and afterwards my PC was extremely slow trying to do anything, even opening a folder. I think I may have interrupted the process since my screen was black and didn't know it was taking place. PC seems to be no longer laggy now.\n\n\\-Flashing bios. Was not successful. Fan was running on high with the CPU mobo light on the entire time.\n\n\\-System restore. Can now access PC for basic internet usage it seems like, but opening games still causes instant crashes.\n\n**System specs:**\n\n\\*\\*-\\*\\*AMD RX 5700 XT (asrock taichi version)\n\n\\-Ryzen 7 3700x 8 core\n\n\\-16 gb corsair RAM\n\n\\-MSI X570A pro mobo\n\nThis seems like a GPU issue to me, but the debug error code is suggesting otherwise...\n\nPS: about a year ago I suffered from consistent blue screen crashes and the like due to faulty ram. I dealt with it for a while until I finally got new ram and a clean windows install. Maybe this has permanently damaged my card. However, things have been totally fine until recently. Only had black screen issues, no game crashing.",

I know HWinfo and GPU-Z sensor logs don't show EVERYTHING and it very well could be my temps but for them to rise that fast and go unseen is a bit more concerning.\n\nI've uninstalled and reinstalled my drivers using DDU and I've cleaned what little dust was around the GPU.

Basically i've been using DOSbox to record voicelines from Dr. SBAITSO from this website [https://classicreload.com/play/dr-sbaitso.html#](https://classicreload.com/play/dr-sbaitso.html#) but it sounds really odd when I use the default microsoft David voice for longer, in game sentences using the built-in TTS feature on Soundpad. Is there any way that something like a Dr. SBAITSO voice TTS can be achieved and put through my microphone so that people in the game can hear it? Any answer would be nice, even if it's a straight \"no\" or \"it would be too complicated to consider.\" I've thought of using AI voice TTS but a lot of them are slow, low quality and generally just bad, and the nicheness of Dr. SBAITSO's voice doesn't help me at all.",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI’ve been struggling with this problem for over a year now. Basically, after about 5 minutes of turning the computer on, both of my monitors go black and display “DisplayPort – No signal.”\n\nDuring this year, I’ve sent the PC three times to the store/service center that originally built it for me. They checked it for free each time since I bought the full setup from them. According to their reports, the problem never occurred on their end — they ran stress tests (including FurMark), replaced the thermal paste on the CPU, and then sent it back. However, the issue always comes back after about a week of normal use once I get it home, which is really strange.\n\nWhen it happens, I am trying to do a blind sequence like Win + D → Alt + F4 → down arrow → Enter to reboot the PC. Sometimes it works, but often I just have to press the reset button on the case. Usually the signal comes back after one restart(not for long), but occasionally I need to restart multiple times.\n\nWhen this happens, the main game I’m playing usually crashes (my friends on Discord tell me that I got kicked), but Discord and Spotify keep working fine — I can still talk and listen to music.\n\nThere are a few different scenarios that can happen 5mins after I turn on my PC:\n\n\\- Monitors turn off(display port no signal), the PC fans get really loud, and after pressing the reset button, the noise immediately stops and the signal returns.\n\n\\- Monitors turn off, the PC stays quiet, but after restarting, it becomes loud (and when it’s loud, there’s always no signal).\n\n\\- Monitors turn off, PC stays quiet, I restart it, and sometimes the signal comes back — sometimes it doesn’t, and I have to restart again.\n\nAfter 2–6 restarts, the problem usually goes away for a few hours (1–4h). It rarely happens when I’m just browsing or doing light stuff — it mostly occurs when I launch a game.\n\nI’m pretty sure it’s not the GPU, since it was sent to an official MSI service center and they found no issues with it.",

When I got to the Disk Selection screen my SSD wasn't there. The funny thing is that if I use \"Load Drivers\" I can see the drive labeled X with the partial windows install (with public user folder, windows folder and such).\n\nI checked the BIOS and my laptop can't detect any SSD to boot.\n\nOnline I saw other people having similar problems but they could solve it by installing the Intel RST drivers which I can't do cause I'm on AMD. Every AMD driver I can find is a .exe I can't use. I even tried looking into the .exe files with 7zip but there aren't any .inf files. HP doesn't provide NVMe/SATA/RAID drivers on my laptop drivers page so I have no idea what to do.\n\nI reset my BIOS settings to default and even tried physically reseating the SSD for good measure, but I made no progress at all.\n\nIf anyone has any theories on what the problem is or what I could do to fix it I'd be very glad to hear your input. thanks for reading all that",

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm trying to use my HP Envy 360 from about 5 years ago on Windows 11to play lethal company with some friends, but every time I open the game, some Windows Driver Foundation thing starts taking up about 25% of my maximum CPU and slowing the laptop down drastically. I've tried disconnecting a second monitor as well as a microphone and USB mouse without much change. I also tried running sfc scannow and the dsim health cleaning commands which offered some help and fixed a couple things supposedly, but they haven't gotten rid of that driver issue. Chatgpt suggest I try to replace all of my graphics and audio drivers with some newer ones and also get a new BIOS update which all seems a bit drastic, especially considering that the HP website suggests that I don't need any driver updates right now after it scans my device. Does the AI really know what it's talking about or is there something just bad about how the game is designed or something. I go from about 20% CPU when looking at just task manager, to 90%+ when I open the game. It's not like it's GTA or something with a huge world, but maybe it's just not very optimized or something. Any suggestions?",

    "selftext": "So I have a hp laptop 15 fc0028AU (AMD Ryzen 5 7520U). So for context, my laptop only has 8 gb ram, and i really get chocked on ram when I try to run multiple apps, and last week, I heard someone mention linux as a great alternative (up until that point, I only knew linux existed, and didn't know much about it). So, i installed linux mint, along with windows. But due to some reason, the audio wasn't working on both OS, so, after researching on the internet, i did a lot of \"kernel\" level changes, but in the end, i somehow corrupted my windows. And after i deleted the linux, it got even more corrupted, and I got to a situation where I needed to reinstall windows via a clean install. \n\nThe problem is, as soon as I start the installation process via a usb drive, it shows the \"show hardware\" screen, which I cannot get past, even after a week. I searched everywhere. The official hp weboste lists every single driver except the storage driver for my model, and I even tried the AMD drivers for my processor, still no use. While researching, many people on reddit said that switching to another older version of win (5+5) and directly upgrading will solve this issue. So i tried that also, but no use. Nothing worked, the assistant failed, the media creation tool failed. Now, i am stuck on win (5+5).\n\nI have heard that the drivers for the same processer might work, even if they are from a different manufacturer, but I cannot find any that match mine (although I think this is due to my lack of knowledge on this topic, and not due to it being non-existent).\n\nSo, can somone please help me by telling me how to the driver",

It wouldnt come on. It was the middle of the night, so i took it to a place to fix it. It was a good place, enough people recommend it and it wasnt expensive. They fixed it so the screen would turn on, but it wouldnt turn on unless it was plugged in. They didnt tell me this, i just found out when i got home and tried to use it. I didn't have time to go back (it was finals week in college) and when i finally had time, i just forgot and didnt have enough money if they tried to charge me again.\n\nFast forward, I haven't used it much because of always needing to be plugged in, and its needed a few updates for a while. Still works fine for most stuff, just some games are starting to get slow.\n\nNow, i cant update the laptop because the \"battery is too low\" and I \"need to plug in my computer\", is what it tells me, but the computer is alway plugged because it won't turn on otherwise, except the computer doesn't register as being plugged in because the battery is basically always at 0% and just using exactly the charge it needs to run and none to save.\n\nI have a Microsoft Surface Laptop 4. Its only 4yrs old, so i definitely dont want another yet.\n\nDo you think it's fixable and maybe how much? Is there anything else I can do to update it without having to fix it? I haven't called the repair place yet, but i might when i have time / money to spair. I can only take it to one place to repair because it requires special tools to open and no one else around here has them.",

    "selftext": "Last night I started having problems loading FUBO content on my AppleTV connected to AT&T fiber wifi with the router provided by AT&T. \n\nThe first thing I did to troubleshoot the issue was check to see if it was working on my iPhone while not connected to wifi. It was/is with no issues at all. But as soon as I connect my phone to wifi, FUBO content stops working. While connected to wifi, the app will load and I can see all current live content available to stream but when I try to stream it, it doesn't load. I also noticed that while I am on wifi, I can't access AT&T's SmartHomeManager iPhone app but as soon as I disconnect from wifi, I can. \n\nI checked other content on my AppleTV. YouTube and HBO work with no problems. Disney, Prime, ESPN, and a lot of other apps will not load any content. This tells me that there is something wrong with accessing only certain content through my wifi. \n\nI have restarted my modem, router, and all content devices. I also made sure all my devices have the most recent software updates completed. Problem persists. \n\nThen I tried the content on my MacBook. Same issue. The same content will not load on any browser that I try and gives the message \"This site can’t be reached. Check if there is a typo. DNS\\_PROBE\\_FINISHED\\_NXDOMAIN).\n\nI have had the same ISP, router, and devices for 6 months with zero problems at all. I've tried everything that I can think of to resolve the issue but nothing is working. I tried contacting AT&T support but that was a complete waste of time. \n\nAny thoughts on what might be happening here and how I can resolve the issue?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Back in 2020, we purchased about 100 iPads for one reason or another. I think something to do with Telehealth. Most of them were used and rolled out to the world, with no problems. \n\nNow it's late 2025, and we have about 20 iPads that we haven't taken out of the box yet. Of these, I believe so far we've found 6 iPads that refuse to turn on and stay on. \n\nWhen plugged into the stock charger (these are older gen 2 pro iPads, so they came with Apple Chargers), they will show the Apple logo for about 3-5 seconds, before it goes away, seemingly turning off, pausing for another 3-5 seconds, and showing the Apple logo again. Not my video, but it looks like this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U\\_wjIpfyXE8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U_wjIpfyXE8) but with a white logo on black background and a different model iPad\n\nSince I have so many brokenish iPads, my coworkers and I have been able to try a few things.   \nFirst, I tried overnight charging with the stock charger.   \nI tried overnight with a faster charger, which was a laptop charger.   \nI tried overnight with a slower charger, which is the USB port on my computer. \n\nThen I tried booting into recovery mode (I believe called DFU mode). I do this a lot, I'm familiar with how the process works.   \nWhen trying to use my desktop to do this, it isn't even getting enough power to show the little computer and plug symbols.   \nWhen trying to boot into recovery while plugged into the wall with the stock charger, it will show the symbol and it will stay on (more on that next), but obviously I can't restore the iPad if I'm plugged up to the wall.   \nNext I tried recovery mode from a laptop that has a thunderbolt port, which seems to have more power in the USB port than my desktop. This would briefly flip to showing the computer and plug symbol, before turning itself off and back on to the Apple symbol. \n\nThe laptop also had one of those ports with a battery+ symbol, but it seemed to power the iPad less than the Thunderbolt port.   \nI also had a powered dock, with the same battery+ symbol that behaved the same. \n\nSince the iPad will seemingly stay on for a few minutes when in recovery mode, I also tried leaving it there for a few minutes. Normal iPad behavior turns that off after a few minutes, and this does the same, putting it back in the bootloop. \n\n  \nWe believe the problem is that the iPad is so dead that it can't start the firmware needed to properly initiate charging. A potential solution to this would be a jumpstart, but not only would we not know how to do this, but it could be dangerous. The other solution would be to take the battery out, charge it externally, and put it back together. We have a lot of iPads that are broken, however, and no experience doing this. Assuming it's even possible. ",

    "selftext": "i have an iphone se 3 and the past few days my phone has been charging really slowly or not at all, like over 2 hours it went up 8% and the battery goes down if i use it while it’s charging.\n\ni can see in a utility that its receiving 8 or so watts of power from my 12w brick (apple one from the second ipad pro). i’ve tried with different bricks and cables and different outlets in my room and tried restarting the phone cleaning the port but it still happens. however my old iphone se 2 that i use for watching shows at night while i charge my se3 overnight since i tend to fall asleep during said viewings does charge just fine with the same cables and outlets i’ve tested before. the se 3 also charges fine on my outlet downstairs. \n\ni thought it was a bug with the optimized battery charging since it only does the slow charging above 80% but my phone was almost dead at this point. but when i plug it in downstairs it charges up 8% in 3 minutes.\n\ni’ve also noticed my battery health keeps jumping around, it’ll go from 89 to 88 then 87 then back to 88 or 89, last week it was at 87 and it’s at 89 right now.\n\nanyone know what this issue could be? it’s weird",

    "title": "After about 5 minutes of turning the computer on, both of my monitors go black and display “DisplayPort – No signal.”",
    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI’ve been struggling with this problem for over a year now. Basically, after about 5 minutes of turning the computer on, both of my monitors go black and display “DisplayPort – No signal.”\n\nDuring this year, I’ve sent the PC three times to the store/service center that originally built it for me. They checked it for free each time since I bought the full setup from them. According to their reports, the problem never occurred on their end — they ran stress tests (including FurMark), replaced the thermal paste on the CPU, and then sent it back. However, the issue always comes back after about a week of normal use once I get it home, which is really strange.\n\nWhen it happens, I am trying to do a blind sequence like Win + D → Alt + F4 → down arrow → Enter to reboot the PC. Sometimes it works, but often I just have to press the reset button on the case. Usually the signal comes back after one restart(not for long), but occasionally I need to restart multiple times.\n\nWhen this happens, the main game I’m playing usually crashes (my friends on Discord tell me that I got kicked), but Discord and Spotify keep working fine — I can still talk and listen to music.\n\nThere are a few different scenarios that can happen 5mins after I turn on my PC:\n\n\\- Monitors turn off(display port no signal), the PC fans get really loud, and after pressing the reset button, the noise immediately stops and the signal returns.\n\n\\- Monitors turn off, the PC stays quiet, but after restarting, it becomes loud (and when it’s loud, there’s always no signal).\n\n\\- Monitors turn off, PC stays quiet, I restart it, and sometimes the signal comes back — sometimes it doesn’t, and I have to restart again.\n\nAfter 2–6 restarts, the problem usually goes away for a few hours (1–4h). It rarely happens when I’m just browsing or doing light stuff — it mostly occurs when I launch a game.\n\nI’m pretty sure it’s not the GPU, since it was sent to an official MSI service center and they found no issues with it.",

I can only hear the call voice. While I think ots a good feature, it kinda hinders as I'm unable to play games and be in call with friends at the same time.\n\nI tried to resolve this issue, when on Call the Headphones were switching audio to Hands Free Audio for communications and Stereo sound for everything else. So during calls the stereo output gets disabled. I asked chatgpt for some fixes, it told me to switch the input/output modes in Discord, when i switched the voice output from Hands Free to Stereo i could neither hear voice audio nor pc audio. It also told that its a bluetooth limitation, that it cant handle both hands free and stereo at same time ig.\n\nI did later found out if i use the AUX cable i can make it perform like regular wired headphones (i lose the noise cancellation feature), but is there a way to achieve this within bluetooth connection?",

To compensate for this, I've been using an Ethernet connection as it worked fine with no issues - that is up until yesterday. \n\nYesterday, I plugged in the Ethernet cable as usual and suddenly it's no longer recognized by the system. Nothing lights up on the router, connections doesn't even show an ethernet cable plugged in. I have ruled out router and cable issues after it worked fine with another laptop but mine won't even recognize the cable plugged in. Device Manager shows the Ethernet controller and reports everything as normal but it can't recognize any connections at all. I've tried a CMOS reset, driver update, device reboot, hard reboot, BIOS update and nothing worked. I've no idea what triggered this, I'm completely lost on a solution to this issue. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'll answer any queries to the best of my abilities to identify the issue/cause.\n\nThanks!",

She's had two different laptop since we moved in and it happens with both of them.\n\nI know it sounds crazy but what could possibly be the explanation here?\n\n  \nETA: we don't honestly have too many devices plugged into wi-fi at once.

It wouldnt come on. It was the middle of the night, so i took it to a place to fix it. It was a good place, enough people recommend it and it wasnt expensive. They fixed it so the screen would turn on, but it wouldnt turn on unless it was plugged in. They didnt tell me this, i just found out when i got home and tried to use it. I didn't have time to go back (it was finals week in college) and when i finally had time, i just forgot and didnt have enough money if they tried to charge me again.\n\nFast forward, I haven't used it much because of always needing to be plugged in, and its needed a few updates for a while. Still works fine for most stuff, just some games are starting to get slow.\n\nNow, i cant update the laptop because the \"battery is too low\" and I \"need to plug in my computer\", is what it tells me, but the computer is alway plugged because it won't turn on otherwise, except the computer doesn't register as being plugged in because the battery is basically always at 0% and just using exactly the charge it needs to run and none to save.\n\nI have a Microsoft Surface Laptop 4. Its only 4yrs old, so i definitely dont want another yet.\n\nDo you think it's fixable and maybe how much? Is there anything else I can do to update it without having to fix it? I haven't called the repair place yet, but i might when i have time / money to spair. I can only take it to one place to repair because it requires special tools to open and no one else around here has them.",

I’m also investing in a spill proof sippy cup.",

    "selftext": "Hi, I bought a 1-year license key for CCleaner from G2A. The app's options are set to automatically renew the subscription after one year, but I didn't provide any credit card information. Should I be concerned? I can't even access my subscriptions because I don't have a Cleverbridge code or email from them. Will I simply lose my PRO license after a year and switch to the free one? How does it work if I purchase a license code from G2A?",

    "selftext": "Hi, I have `Apacer AS2280P4U 1TB` SSD, and apart from a few instances where it was unreachable and required a restart, it worked well. Until last week. I noticed that QuickSFV was taking an unusually long time to check my files. Today I had a problem with Steam updating a game (disk usage being around 1MB/s), so I decided to check it out.\n\nChkdsk shows no bad sectors. But the Winsat showed the potential problem:  \n`Disk  Random 16.0 Read                       7.64 MB/s          5.2`  \n`Disk  Sequential 64.0 Read                   526.36 MB/s          8.1`  \n`Disk  Sequential 64.0 Write                  267.24 MB/s          7.6`  \n`Average Read Time with Sequential Writes     32.159 ms          1.9`  \n`Latency: 95th Percentile                     157.665 ms          1.9`  \n`Latency: Maximum                             1728.836 ms          1.9`  \n`Average Read Time with Random Writes         42.032 ms          1.9`  \nThese values are a far cry from the 3000MB/s it's supposed to have. So I tried Crystal disk info but it doesn't show any problems: [https://imgur.com/a/BaLl6Dk](https://imgur.com/a/BaLl6Dk)\n\nWhat to do? I also checked, and it's seen as an SSD, in the right port.
