    "selftext": "Tim Cook said in the earnings call this week that Apple is moving ahead with the long-promised Siri improvements and a more sophisticated Apple Intelligence.  Sure enough, I’m getting non-stop requests for feedback on my use of Siri and Apple Intelligence across my devices.  It’s ranged from whether Siri responded correctly to setting and canceling an alarm to whether email and notification summaries are accurate.  I’ve given detailed responses when something wasn’t right in hopes that I’ll support anything that will help Apple deliver what it has promised.  Anyone else noticed increased feedback requests? Is Apple finally going to make Siri more usable and make progress on integrating artificial intelligence into the user experience?\n\nEdited to add missing word.",

    "selftext": "I just feel like sometimes when I get something from Apple and it works like garbage right out of the box, there’s no way it’s a brand new device. \n\nI got an iPhone 13 Pro Max when it came out. Right out of the box, inside the store, it wouldn’t connect to WiFi, it wouldn’t connect to 5G or LTE and it had to be connected via Ethernet. That phone had problems right out of the box and when we asked if we could get another phone that didn’t need to be connected via Ethernet for set up (while my mom had her iPhone 13 Pro out of the box set up beautifully with no extra support needed, they refused). \n\nJust now I got an Apple Pencil. Brand new. Off the Apple Store App. Engraved. And it only HALF works. It can click stuff. That’s it. It will not draw. \n\nOn procreate, the eraser works, smudge and paint don’t. On ArtStudio pro, nothing works. And on the iOS notes app, it draws. It was als\n\nMy really cheap $30 off brand “Apple” pencil works beautiful for everything though. \n\nI’ve reset the iPad, the pencil (forget this device), I’ve swapped out the Apple Pencil tips (official ones, even the bootleg one has an official tip on it) and it doesn’t work. \n\nIt wasn’t closed all the way (the tip) and won’t close all the way. I’m going to take this pencil into the Apple Store and ask for one that’s actually new or a refund if they give me another busted pencil. \n\nI might as well have bought three bootleg pencils and I’d have saved money and wouldn’t have products that actually work. \n",

    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

All fine and dandy.\n\nBut I still don't know how/if it's possible to get 5 Apps into a single row. And while this might be an oddly specific and \"irrelevant\" thing to most  - it's essential for me, as I have my setup exactly how I want it to be.\n\nAnd searching the web so far has brought me just coping mechanisms, questionable 3rd party apps and straight up fake information.😤\n\nso I'm really hoping y'all can help me with this....😅",

I’ve been wanting to fix the phone and I’m planning to take it to the store soon, since I was able to add it to my AC1 plan and it says that it is elegible for coverage, will Apple reps find out the phone was broken before purchasing insurance? It is such a big hit for me to pay full price for a repair since it’s almost the price of a new phone and I still love this phone so much. ",

Screen Time is actively tracking something that technically cannot exist on iOS.\n\nHas anyone seen this before? Is this:\n- A Screen Time bug showing phantom apps from backups?\n- Some beta app masquerading with this bundle ID?\n- Cross-device sync glitch bleeding Mac processes into iPhone (though it's disabled)?\n- A security concern?\n\nAny insights would be appreciated.

    "selftext": "I just bought a new iPhone 16 Pro Max, and I noticed something strange inside the left camera lens. I’ve added pictures below so you can see what I mean. There’s a tiny point that looks like it’s inside the lens not on the surface. It’s always in the same place and doesn’t move. When I look at it under the flash light or in sunlight, it kind of glows or reflects, which makes me think it’s not dust, but maybe a small scratch or something under the glass. There’s also a second, even smaller point next to it. Both are really tiny, but once you see them, you can’t unsee them. They don’t seem to affect my photos, but I can’t stop thinking about them, especially since this is a new phone. Has anyone experienced something similar with an iPhone camera? Do you think Apple would replace the phone for this kind of issue, or would they say it’s normal?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxeb104lkoyf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1280f9845c43abd5e326ee013c4393f81bd9a62f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfhs705lkoyf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3f49f303b65b2a56c2b15344d4dcb45c35850f6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbdk424lkoyf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0bef31a5668e2a10d35aaff0bc16c62f77ca72d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggstx34lkoyf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61100d4b679907f2ee31322419b3099e31b573ab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gn39n34lkoyf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73d3323a87c6c1718fe5dad22df9e879db610a49\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1hkib4lkoyf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6435ffbd94fc177fafd045f569486e2d80e0545\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jfzl64lkoyf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6463ee53f99eef72124beffc4752d2dff6769e74",

Because sometimes his phone blocks thinking his screen time has reached its limit, but he claims he hasn’t used it that much. I don’t think he can (or is using) any detours like deleting/reinstalling apps, but something seems to causing problems. Can’t really find a solution Google, so was hoping someone here knows anything? Picture is from yesterdays phone use. ",

Can anyone let me know if this is normal but my friend assured me that the OS was like that since the beginning and kept saying it's not laggy and is normal. ",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

I'd set a wake-up alarm for 9:00AM, tell Siri \"cancel my wake-up alarm\", then she'll respond \"I couldn't find the alarm you're asking for\". \n\nI was planning on upgrading to a newer iphone, but I am seeing no signs of improvement for either Siri or the speech to text. Is there any insider info at all about any notable progress for Siri or the speech-to-text keyboard? I have been a lifelong iPhone user but am on the verge of  switching if it continues to be like this without radical improvements to either software.

    "selftext": "So last week I decided to purchase AC1 for my AirPods Max because they were acting weird, and I added to the list my iPhone 14 Pro and MacBook. So a few months ago I dropped my phone, mind you it was caseless (my fault), and the back of it is broken. I’ve been wanting to fix the phone and I’m planning to take it to the store soon, since I was able to add it to my AC1 plan and it says that it is elegible for coverage, will Apple reps find out the phone was broken before purchasing insurance? It is such a big hit for me to pay full price for a repair since it’s almost the price of a new phone and I still love this phone so much. ",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Alert: Feature creates Severe Vulnerability",
    "selftext": "Recently, I received a text from Android that during an update a new feature was automatically enabled. This feature is called Smart Wi-Fi and on the surface it seems like a great idea that will ensure you are always connected to Wi-Fi instead of using your Mobile Data. However, this feature is also enabled automatically (and this is important), which is one of the roots of the problem.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that I've been in IT for over 23 years, 12 of which were specializing in Cybersecurity and I currently hold both the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker through EC Council) as well as my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional through Offensive Security which is also an Ethical Hacker certification). With that out of the way, please allow me to explain what the vulnerability is and how it affects everyone that uses it.\n\nThe Smart Wi-Fi feature attempts to work much like Mesh Networking which is to say, you stay connected to a Wi-Fi network internet enabled device without interruption so the switch is seamless and instant, and it stays connected to the most powerful network detected, ensuring the strongest connection. This feature operates much like how Cisco and Ubiquity Unifi's Mesh networking works.\n\nThe big difference however is with Cisco and Unifi Mesh networking (and other similar mesh networking) you rely on multiple devices connected to the SAME network, thus you don't change networks but rather you stay connected to the closes device on the network you're attached to ensuring the best connection signal even when roaming around.\n\nWith me so far? Great! Now let's discuss the vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Mesh Networking as mentioned above, Smart Wi-Fi attempts to remain connected to Wi-Fi devices. It does state Known networks but in testing, I was able to connect to my rogue Wi-Fi network automatically despite not being in my known network list and the why is simple.\n\nThere's a technique known as Man-In-The-Middle or MITM for short, which is used by both Red Team (Penetration Testers/Ethical Hackers) as well as Threat Actors. In this process what I would do is set up my rogue Wi-Fi network provider and mimic the SSID of the network I want to compromise. I then leave the password option off and then broadcast the Wi-Fi signal at a stronger strength than what the devices inside the network I want to compromise is. Because of this Smart Wi-Fi feature, those with this SSID saved have a good chance of automatically connecting to my rogue Wi-Fi device and since I provide internet through it, they aren't the wiser. This happens as soon as the device they're connected to becomes weaker than mine. Once this happens, I may push a prompt that asks the user to reenter their Wi-Fi credentials, and if successful I just compromised the target networks security, bypassing it completely.\n\nHome owners will likely not have much to worry about as Threat Actors don't typically attempt to attack home networks - it's really a waste of time and effort with little to gain. However, government and businesses are prime targets.\n\nThe solution is to disable the option that is automatically enabled which allows your Android phone to connect to the strongest Known network. The risk isn't in connecting to known networks, but rather the automatic switching of networks which enables the use of SSID Spoofing and MITM attacks.\n\nI hope this does some of you good and hopefully Android's team will also see this and have this feature disabled by default instead of enabled. That way if people want to take the risk they can instead of being unaware of the risk in the first place.",

There seems to be some wierd issue with the playback which turns what should be black into a greyish shade. When I first swipe to a video for a split second I can see what the video should look like before it goes weird. It's almost like it's applying some type of filter over the video that's messing with the contrast. I've tried different versions of tiktok and same issue. It also had \"slowdowns\" during playback and then is fine after a while. \n\nAny help would be great as it's really making using this phone not enjoyable.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I've had issues with three Pixel devices when trying to debug applications. I have a Pixel 7 Pro XL, Pixel 8a and a Pixel 10 Pro and all have the same issue. Deploying applications for testing is painful. Jetbrains Rider takes forever to deploy and often gets stuck attempting to. Then, when I restart Rider the devices disappear and can't be deployed to.\n\nI've battled this for years and thought it was only an issue with my old Pixel 7, but now I have the 10 and access to an 8a with the same issue, I'm asking for some guidance. I have an S20 Ultra, which I can deploy to reliably but I would like to carry around one device and I think that I shouldn't have this issue with any Pixel phone.\n\nI've run adb commands to kill and restart the server, which only occasionally jumpstarts the connection for debugging again. But then I get stuck trying to deploy which causes me to restart Rider and then the device disappears again. Running adb devices when my Pixel devices are connected show `55291FDCH000KV offline` but the S20 Ultra shows `R5CN20J7RSD device` and I'm not sure what that means or how to solve it to be honest. I'm lost for what to do.\n\nI've tried all the different connection modes when selecting \"Use USB For\". Tried different cables, from offical to high quality third party ones. Tried wireless debugging which is just as spotty and slow. Has anyone else ran into similar problems when debugging on Pixel devices? How can I fix this? It's becoming a nuisance to my app development.",

    "selftext": "I'm posting this because I spent weeks going absolutely mad trying to fix persistent Wi-Fi connectivity issues with my new Google Pixel 9 (this probably applies to the other series too). The connection was constantly dropping, or just refusing to connect to my home network. \n\nSome of my friends networks, or at the gym connected just fine. \n\n​I went through all the standard troubleshooting with Google Support: safe mode, network resets, factory resets... nothing worked. Eventually I had to send my phone for repair to the Google store , they determined there was a connectivity issue. But couldn't fix the phone because there were \"no spare parts\" for my model (weird, I know) and sent me a new Pixel 9.\n\n​Guess what? The exact same problems persisted.\n\n​That's when I realised the problem wasn't the phone; it was my older router. Modern phones like the Pixel sometimes have conflicts with certain older Wi-Fi defaults. After digging deep into the router settings by screenshotting them and pasting them into gemini asking what settings would be best for my pixel 9.\n\nI found a few key adjustments that completely fixed the issue and gave a solid Wi-Fi connection. \n\n\n​Setting Recommended for 2.4ghz\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Change from \"20/40\" or \"Auto\" to 20 MHz.\nMode: Change from \"11n Only\" to Mixed Mode (11b+11g+11n).\nChannel: Change from \"Auto\" or a high number (e.g., 13) to 1, 6, or 11.\nAPSD: Capable (Power Saving) Change from \"Enable\" to Disable.\n\nSetting Recommended for 5ghz\n\nMode: Ensure 802.11ac is enabled (e.g., \"Mixed 11a+11n+11ac\").\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Keep the highest option like 80 MHz or \"Auto 40/80 MHz\".\n\nBand Steering: If present, Disable it.\n\n",

Last night while I'm outside the Comedy Cellar 3 men assaulted this woman. I called 911 but after it called my boss at 1 am in the morning and recorded the conversation.

In the second scenario it must be making contact before the phone is turned on, and once I release it the loss of contact is causing it to shut off.\n\n[Here is a video displaying the issue](https://imgur.com/a/FSuDJt9), does anyone know what could be causing this?

Security patches and major updates bring fixes not only for battery-draining bugs, but also protection against viruses and malware that may be stealing your charge, or worse. Individual app updates may also provide performance improvements to your battery.\n\n###Check for power-hungry apps.\nDespite battery-saving features like [Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html), some apps may still be able to drain away your charge undetected. Try the following steps to identify any power-hungry apps.\n\n* Make sure that the \"Apps consuming battery\" notification is enabled, and wait a few minutes to see if it appears. (Find the toggle in Settings > Apps & notifications > See all ___ apps > More options (the triple dot) > Show system > Android system > Notifications > Other)\n* Check the battery usage of your apps in Settings > Battery > More options (the triple dot) > Battery usage. Remember that battery life may be reduced with usage of certain features (location, Bluetooth, etc.) and apps (gaming, video, etc.).\n* Turn on battery optimizations for all apps, (Under Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special app access > Battery optimization, and tap each app to change it to *Optimize*), and also enable Adaptive Battery, which limits rarely used apps (Under Settings > Battery > Adaptive Battery).\n* Force stop or uninstall any new apps and monitor battery life. (You can do this by going into Settings > search for *appName* & select *appName*)\n* Temporarily disable all installed apps with Safe Mode, to see if an existing/updated app is the problem. (Enter Safe Mode by pressing & holding the power button, and then pressing and holding *Restart*, and finally tapping OK. To exit Safe Mode, restart your phone as normal. You may have to sign into some apps again.) If your battery life improves, use the aforementioned methods on older apps.\n\n###Investigate battery intensive features.\nSome functions on you phone may use more power than you expect, especially in different scenarios. Take a look at this list for **a few** possibilities:\n\n* **Bluetooth** is notorious for its high-energy usage, especially when actively transferring data. Turn it off if it's not needed, and if you do, consider looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, which need much less power.\n* **Location** also uses quite a bit in order to pinpoint your position. Turn off Wifi/Cellular data/Bluetooth location accuracy (Settings > Security and Location > Location > Advanced > Battery saving > Google Location Accuracy) or turn Location off completely.\n* **Cellular** can also drain your battery when the signal is weak. At these times, more electricity is needed to stay connected, no matter if you're in the forest or underground. If you don't require a cellular connection (for example, if you have Wifi Calling), put your phone into Airplane mode and re-enable Wifi/Bluetooth if needed.\n\n###Contact Google Support.\nGoogle's dedicated Pixel support team may be able to help diagnose and fix your issue. Find them in Settings > Tips & Support, or just ask your Google Assistant \"troubleshoot my battery\".\n\n###IF ALL ELSE FAILS, factory reset your phone.\nSometimes wiping your phone is all that's needed to bring your battery back to life. Google Drive and Google Photos do a decent job with keeping your apps and data (check in Settings > Google > Backup > Back up now **and check** Google Photos > sidebar (the three lines) > Settings > Backup and sync), but ***please personally make sure that everything is backed up to something off your phone.*** To wipe your phone, [follow the steps here.](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4596836)\n\n*This megathread will be replaced on the 1^st of each month at 10:00 UTC.

    "selftext": "I want to share an extremely disappointing experience with Google Pixel support in India and seek guidance from the community on how to escalate this to the correct Grievance Officer as required under the Consumer Protection rules.\n\nThis started with a simple request to replace an original Pixel case that began peeling. What followed has been a draining and unnecessary struggle that no customer should have to go through:\n\n* Endless back and forth asking for the same information again and again even after submitting valid proof\n* Support insisted on Google Maps based address verification which is one sided and unrealistic in India and I had to go through the process of getting my address added to Maps just to move forward\n* Replacement was withheld because of a rigid policy that they will ship the new item only after they physically receive the old one which puts the entire waiting time and inconvenience on the customer\n* Shipment got stuck in transit for days with zero ownership taken by support and everything kept getting delayed\n* No coordination or accountability across support agents social media responses and email teams and no one took end to end responsibility\n* After all this stress the replacement that finally arrived was in the wrong color despite written confirmation from Google Support that it would match the original\n\nThis entire journey has been mentally exhausting and reflects a serious lack of customer centricity especially from a global brand that promotes quality and trust.\n\nTo escalate responsibly before going public, I also wrote to [**support-in@google.com**]() as the designated India support address but received no response at all. What is even more concerning is that I requested the official Grievance Officer contact details multiple times which customers in India are legally entitled to under the Consumer Protection Act and the request was continuously ignored.\n\nAt this point I am posting this for two reasons:\n\n1. So others are aware of what kind of support to expect if their Pixel accessory goes bad in India\n2. To request guidance from anyone who has successfully escalated a case to Google India’s Grievance Officer for consumer issues\n\nIf anyone has the correct and official contact details of the Grievance Officer for Google India or a working escalation path that actually responds please share it. It will help ensure that this situation is handled properly and hopefully prevent other consumers from going through the same ordeal.\n\nNo customer should be pushed through such a painful process for a basic replacement. I hope this helps drive some awareness and pushes for better accountability.",

I'm still baffled that google maps doesn't prompt my next calendar event when Waze does without a hitch?\n\nApple has copped alot of flack for their AI achievements but I personally never had any issues with doing any of the above tasks with Siri along with messaging tasks on various apps or weather questions. \n\nUnless I'm doing a google search question or finding out what the weather will be like., it's near useless as a \"assistant\". \n\nAm I alone here? Am I speaking to it incorrectly or is Gemini literally that detached, slow and clunky in comparison to Siri? ",

    "selftext": "A couple weeks ago and out of nowhere,  my phone decided it didn't want to recognize the sim card. Rebooted it, which did work, but would soon lose connection to sim again (usually within minutes). \n\nContacted Google support who confirmed a hardware issue and gave 3 options. (Perform a factory reset, send for repair or get replacement). Tried the factory reset that day, but didn't fix the problem. Called Google support the following day and asked for a replacement. That's when the support team rep said they encountered an error since my phone was purchased through third party (it was through Telus - large Canadian telecom company). Was asked to send over service agreement, which I did right away. Telus is an authorized dealer, so no issues there\n\nIt's been now a week and Google is still unable to send me the link to order my replacement phone. \n\nAlso, the phone is getting worse by the day. \n\n-Front screen becomes unresponsive sometimes, open to the dual screen and that works. Had to boot in safe mode to get front screen working again\n\n-huge lag when unfolding to dual screen and back to front screen,  where screen remains black. Have to push power button for it to respond\n\n-phone intermittently powers off. Won't turn back on with power button. Had to plug into charger and wait 15 minutes and then powered on (battery was well above 50%)\n\n-random screen flickers and audio issues. Then powers off on its own\n\nI've owned pixel phones since OG pixel. I own a business with 10 phone lines (many of them pixel phones). I even got my kids and wife on the pixel train\n\nBut, after enduring minor issues with every single pixel phone, this current issue is really making me question my loyalty to Google devices.  \n\nIt's not even the issues that's the main problem for me. The fact it's been 1.5 weeks and they can't even figure out how to send the link to order my replacement is ridiculous. \n\nThat's my rant. I hope this post helps others going through similar issue with their device.",

    "title": "Pixels: Why are they still \"almost\" good?",
    "selftext": "Lifelong android and PC power user here; I've built desktops, worked in tech support, rooted and messed around with countless phones. In the last 3 years I've started using more of the Apple ecosystem (sounds of shock!) for work... Mac, phone, AirPods; you get the gist.\n\nAs an average user (and most of us are), I'm amazed how Pixels (and PCs, Samsung etc) still aren't able to make the user experience as good as Apple. Some peeves I couldn't shake off:\n\n**Pixel phone 9 pro:**\n\n* Camera: It's 2024 (when it was released). Why is the OIS still jittery? Why is the transition between zoom options still not smooth? Guys, you're claiming to be a flagship phone that I can use to take photos of my kids. Fucking get it right already. It's \"almost good\" but not quite.\n* Reception: My cell reception drops once every few weeks; I have to restart to get it back. A flagship phone \\*must\\* have better quality control. You're trashing your own brand image!\n* Lag: Basic app-switching tends to crash at least twice a month. Am I on Windows 2000? (Nevermind, that was worse)\n* UI: Callout - The universal back button is god-like. Please have your UX team think about how to reduce number of swipes and taps to get to commonly used items. Both iOS and Android do a piss poor job in their own area, but if Android wants to differentiate itself then this needs to get better still. It's \"almost good\" but still not.\n\n**Pixel buds pro 2:**\n\n* Sound: Comparing to AirPods Pro 2 (which released earlier)- the sound is simply not as good. Sorry guys, why the hell did I pay the same amount for this trash?\n* ANC: For my old ears the difference has been minimal; I can let it slide\n* Transparency: Absolute rubbish. It feels like I'm listening through layers of clothing; I usually give up and just take my buds off.\n* Controls: I've had the buds for over a year and I still can't tap it the right way. Always I think \"FFS just work!\". You could say I'm dumb, and I'll argue that a bud at this price point is meant to be easy, it's meant for a dumb user.\n* Ergonomics: Every time I tap the buds it feels like I'm going to go deaf with the heavy thump on my ear (I tried being gentle). I don't know if it's inevitable because there's no stem or if this is poor sounds insulation. Either ways, not a good look for \"premium\" earphones.\n\nDo I still use my Pixel phone? Yes, but for music and camera I increasingly migrate to my iPhone.\n\nDo I still use my pixel buds? Hell no, that crap makes me yearn for the AirPods.\n\nDo I want to switch to Apple full-time? No I don't, but I'm sorely tempted as I get older and care less about UI customization.\n\nGoogle, please figure out if you truly want to deliver flagship hardware. Otherwise stop pretending and ruining your brand.",

Everything feels so much smoother when scrolling. \n\nThe screen is great, it gets bright as hell and everything looks great on it, the keyboard is infinitely better than iOS, notifications are handled way better. \n\nThe camera to me is way better. I can easily point and shoot and get a quality picture with this phone. Video recording looks better on the iPhone but not a ton better to my old color blind eyes. \n\nI got the mint mobile deal, $847 with tax for the 256gb pixel 10 pro xl and a year of unlimited service.

Is it a downgrade, or does it have useful features?\nWhat's the camera experience really like compared to Pixel's point-and-shoot magic?\nAm I going to severely miss the Pixel-exclusive features (like Call Screen, Now Playing, etc.)?\nWhat about software updates and long-term support?\nAny thoughts, pros, or cons you could share would be hugely appreciated.

You can do this quickly and discreetly without ever taking your phone out of your pocket.\n\nTo activate lockdown mode on a Pixel 9 Pro, you must press and hold the power button and volume button simultaneously (try doing this with one hand) and then look at the screen and tap the \"Lockdown\" button (altogether impossible to do without removing the phone from my pocket).\n\nIMO, this is absurd for a security feature and feels increasingly risky given the state of affairs today. Having to pull out your phone, navigate menus, and use both hands completely defeats the purpose. In a situation where you actually need this feature, drawing that kind of attention could make things worse.\n\nAm I the only one frustrated by this? Is there some workaround I'm missing?",

    "selftext": "As read in another post, other user had the horrible experience of using Pixel in Japan with esim and ended up with shutter sound automatically turned on, then can't shut it off even after back to original country.\n\nIs anybody else here had the same experience?\n\nI'm from China where there's no official Pixel release, and I've long known that any phone brought in Japan by law would have the shutter sound turned on, while iPhone have solved this issue several years ago by auto geography recognition that once you are outside of Japan, it could be turned off, but Google has never dealt with the issue so far. That's why I would never buy a pixel in Japan.\n\nAnd I will be in Japan in December for a big vacation, now looks like just to avoid the possible nightmare scenario, I would have to either use expensive data or rent a portable wifi, jeez, I was enjoying the esim experience so much last week in Barcelona and was really looking forward to use it in Japan😭",

I’ve had iPhone for a long time (don’t judge!) because I really wasn’t a fan of the Galaxy phones and I grew up in Silicon Valley in an area that was using Apple products since I was in elementary school. I know, I know, they’re not the only androids out there, as my friend has told me. Anyway, I started my family and got iPads and am pretty Apple integrated. A lot of accessories are readily available for iPhone like cases and screen protectors. But I’ve been thinking about maybe switching to the Pixel because I love Google. I’ve been using Chrome since forever. I always hated Safari and only used Firefox briefly - once Chrome came out, I never went back. So how many pixel users are out there? I see almost everyone and their mother use iPhones. I love iMessage but now there’s RCS. I have an Apple Watch 11 but the battery life is still meh after all these years. Anyway, thanks for any feedback in advance! ",

    "selftext": "I'm posting this because I spent weeks going absolutely mad trying to fix persistent Wi-Fi connectivity issues with my new Google Pixel 9 (this probably applies to the other series too). The connection was constantly dropping, or just refusing to connect to my home network. \n\nSome of my friends networks, or at the gym connected just fine. \n\n​I went through all the standard troubleshooting with Google Support: safe mode, network resets, factory resets... nothing worked. Eventually I had to send my phone for repair to the Google store , they determined there was a connectivity issue. But couldn't fix the phone because there were \"no spare parts\" for my model (weird, I know) and sent me a new Pixel 9.\n\n​Guess what? The exact same problems persisted.\n\n​That's when I realised the problem wasn't the phone; it was my older router. Modern phones like the Pixel sometimes have conflicts with certain older Wi-Fi defaults. After digging deep into the router settings by screenshotting them and pasting them into gemini asking what settings would be best for my pixel 9.\n\nI found a few key adjustments that completely fixed the issue and gave a solid Wi-Fi connection. \n\n\n​Setting Recommended for 2.4ghz\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Change from \"20/40\" or \"Auto\" to 20 MHz.\nMode: Change from \"11n Only\" to Mixed Mode (11b+11g+11n).\nChannel: Change from \"Auto\" or a high number (e.g., 13) to 1, 6, or 11.\nAPSD: Capable (Power Saving) Change from \"Enable\" to Disable.\n\nSetting Recommended for 5ghz\n\nMode: Ensure 802.11ac is enabled (e.g., \"Mixed 11a+11n+11ac\").\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Keep the highest option like 80 MHz or \"Auto 40/80 MHz\".\n\nBand Steering: If present, Disable it.\n\n",

    "title": "Battery Megathread (November 2025)",
    "selftext": "Welcome to the Battery Megathread, where you can find information and get assistance with any battery-related issues your Pixel might be facing. *All battery-related posts made outside this megathread will be removed.*\n\nBefore you make a comment, try these troubleshooting tips:\n\n###Stay up to date with the latest version of Android and your apps.\nAlthough some people may argue that a system update ruined their battery life (and occasionally this is the cause), it's always a good idea to make sure you device is running the latest version of Android (check anytime in Settings > System > Advanced > System update > Check for update). Security patches and major updates bring fixes not only for battery-draining bugs, but also protection against viruses and malware that may be stealing your charge, or worse. Individual app updates may also provide performance improvements to your battery.\n\n###Check for power-hungry apps.\nDespite battery-saving features like [Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html), some apps may still be able to drain away your charge undetected. Try the following steps to identify any power-hungry apps.\n\n* Make sure that the \"Apps consuming battery\" notification is enabled, and wait a few minutes to see if it appears. (Find the toggle in Settings > Apps & notifications > See all ___ apps > More options (the triple dot) > Show system > Android system > Notifications > Other)\n* Check the battery usage of your apps in Settings > Battery > More options (the triple dot) > Battery usage. Remember that battery life may be reduced with usage of certain features (location, Bluetooth, etc.) and apps (gaming, video, etc.).\n* Turn on battery optimizations for all apps, (Under Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special app access > Battery optimization, and tap each app to change it to *Optimize*), and also enable Adaptive Battery, which limits rarely used apps (Under Settings > Battery > Adaptive Battery).\n* Force stop or uninstall any new apps and monitor battery life. (You can do this by going into Settings > search for *appName* & select *appName*)\n* Temporarily disable all installed apps with Safe Mode, to see if an existing/updated app is the problem. (Enter Safe Mode by pressing & holding the power button, and then pressing and holding *Restart*, and finally tapping OK. To exit Safe Mode, restart your phone as normal. You may have to sign into some apps again.) If your battery life improves, use the aforementioned methods on older apps.\n\n###Investigate battery intensive features.\nSome functions on you phone may use more power than you expect, especially in different scenarios. Take a look at this list for **a few** possibilities:\n\n* **Bluetooth** is notorious for its high-energy usage, especially when actively transferring data. Turn it off if it's not needed, and if you do, consider looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, which need much less power.\n* **Location** also uses quite a bit in order to pinpoint your position. Turn off Wifi/Cellular data/Bluetooth location accuracy (Settings > Security and Location > Location > Advanced > Battery saving > Google Location Accuracy) or turn Location off completely.\n* **Cellular** can also drain your battery when the signal is weak. At these times, more electricity is needed to stay connected, no matter if you're in the forest or underground. If you don't require a cellular connection (for example, if you have Wifi Calling), put your phone into Airplane mode and re-enable Wifi/Bluetooth if needed.\n\n###Contact Google Support.\nGoogle's dedicated Pixel support team may be able to help diagnose and fix your issue. Find them in Settings > Tips & Support, or just ask your Google Assistant \"troubleshoot my battery\".\n\n###IF ALL ELSE FAILS, factory reset your phone.\nSometimes wiping your phone is all that's needed to bring your battery back to life. Google Drive and Google Photos do a decent job with keeping your apps and data (check in Settings > Google > Backup > Back up now **and check** Google Photos > sidebar (the three lines) > Settings > Backup and sync), but ***please personally make sure that everything is backed up to something off your phone.*** To wipe your phone, [follow the steps here.](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4596836)\n\n*This megathread will be replaced on the 1^st of each month at 10:00 UTC.

It either happens when I go to click on comments or even when my phone pops up with a notification and vibrates, even when I swipe for a different video it did this. This has never happened before and only when I just got the new update and it's been happing multiple times within just a few minutes.

Rebooted it, which did work, but would soon lose connection to sim again (usually within minutes). \n\nContacted Google support who confirmed a hardware issue and gave 3 options. (Perform a factory reset, send for repair or get replacement). Tried the factory reset that day, but didn't fix the problem. Called Google support the following day and asked for a replacement. That's when the support team rep said they encountered an error since my phone was purchased through third party (it was through Telus - large Canadian telecom company). Was asked to send over service agreement, which I did right away. Telus is an authorized dealer, so no issues there\n\nIt's been now a week and Google is still unable to send me the link to order my replacement phone. \n\nAlso, the phone is getting worse by the day. \n\n-Front screen becomes unresponsive sometimes, open to the dual screen and that works. Had to boot in safe mode to get front screen working again\n\n-huge lag when unfolding to dual screen and back to front screen,  where screen remains black. Have to push power button for it to respond\n\n-phone intermittently powers off. Won't turn back on with power button. Had to plug into charger and wait 15 minutes and then powered on (battery was well above 50%)\n\n-random screen flickers and audio issues. Then powers off on its own\n\nI've owned pixel phones since OG pixel. I own a business with 10 phone lines (many of them pixel phones). I even got my kids and wife on the pixel train\n\nBut, after enduring minor issues with every single pixel phone, this current issue is really making me question my loyalty to Google devices.  \n\nIt's not even the issues that's the main problem for me. The fact it's been 1.5 weeks and they can't even figure out how to send the link to order my replacement is ridiculous. \n\nThat's my rant.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I've had issues with three Pixel devices when trying to debug applications. I have a Pixel 7 Pro XL, Pixel 8a and a Pixel 10 Pro and all have the same issue. Deploying applications for testing is painful. Jetbrains Rider takes forever to deploy and often gets stuck attempting to. Then, when I restart Rider the devices disappear and can't be deployed to.\n\nI've battled this for years and thought it was only an issue with my old Pixel 7, but now I have the 10 and access to an 8a with the same issue, I'm asking for some guidance. I have an S20 Ultra, which I can deploy to reliably but I would like to carry around one device and I think that I shouldn't have this issue with any Pixel phone.\n\nI've run adb commands to kill and restart the server, which only occasionally jumpstarts the connection for debugging again. But then I get stuck trying to deploy which causes me to restart Rider and then the device disappears again. Running adb devices when my Pixel devices are connected show `55291FDCH000KV offline` but the S20 Ultra shows `R5CN20J7RSD device` and I'm not sure what that means or how to solve it to be honest. I'm lost for what to do.\n\nI've tried all the different connection modes when selecting \"Use USB For\". Tried different cables, from offical to high quality third party ones. Tried wireless debugging which is just as spotty and slow. Has anyone else ran into similar problems when debugging on Pixel devices? How can I fix this? It's becoming a nuisance to my app development.",

I put my SIM into another phone and confirmed the issue is to do with my device.\n\nI contacted Google Support who ran me through a myriad of troubleshooting steps in my settings to no success. Instead of being able to open a ticket all they advised to do was \"Submit Feedback\" through the phone app and describe my issue. Disappointing. I've done this 5 times now and nothing's happened.\n\nVery frustrating as I basically haven't had caller ID for 2 months now, have no idea who's calling me and if I miss a call and the person doesn't leave a voicemail I have no idea who to call back. Spam protection also seems to have stopped working as I'm getting tons more spam and robo calls since the issue started.\n\nI've been a Pixel user since the 3 and have generally been happy with the devices. It seems like I'm out of options now other than getting a new phone.\n\nHas anyone had this issue and any ideas how to resolve?",

A better looking 3.5x zoom photo:\n\nIf you miss the 3.5x zoom perspective for human portrait shots, zoom over the 5X slider until the tele lens kicks-in and drag the slider slowly back to 3.5X and then click the shutter. This will process an image which has the details from the 5X lens fusioned with the Main lens's digital crop. The resulting picture is highly usable if the subject in the frame is one or two people. You can also use Google photos to apply the blur which creates a decent potrait image.\n\n2. A better zoom lens transition in video:\n\nIf you want a better zoom transition/switch between the lenses, just before hitting the video record button try to zoom in and zoom out of the 5x lens manually for a few times. By doing so you will observe that the transition to the 5X lens becomes a bit faster than the usual. Once you feel it, you can hit on the recorder button and then zoom in.\n\nIdeally Google should make these stuff available by default but i am glad that they are present at least. ",

The connection was constantly dropping, or just refusing to connect to my home network. \n\nSome of my friends networks, or at the gym connected just fine. \n\n​I went through all the standard troubleshooting with Google Support: safe mode, network resets, factory resets... nothing worked. Eventually I had to send my phone for repair to the Google store , they determined there was a connectivity issue. But couldn't fix the phone because there were \"no spare parts\" for my model (weird, I know) and sent me a new Pixel 9.\n\n​Guess what? The exact same problems persisted.\n\n​That's when I realised the problem wasn't the phone; it was my older router. Modern phones like the Pixel sometimes have conflicts with certain older Wi-Fi defaults. After digging deep into the router settings by screenshotting them and pasting them into gemini asking what settings would be best for my pixel 9.\n\nI found a few key adjustments that completely fixed the issue and gave a solid Wi-Fi connection. \n\n\n​Setting Recommended for 2.4ghz\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Change from \"20/40\" or \"Auto\" to 20 MHz.\nMode: Change from \"11n Only\" to Mixed Mode (11b+11g+11n).\nChannel: Change from \"Auto\" or a high number (e.g., 13) to 1, 6, or 11.\nAPSD: Capable (Power Saving) Change from \"Enable\" to Disable.\n\nSetting Recommended for 5ghz\n\nMode: Ensure 802.11ac is enabled (e.g., \"Mixed 11a+11n+11ac\").\n\nChannel Bandwidth: Keep the highest option like 80 MHz or \"Auto 40/80 MHz\".\n\nBand Steering: If present, Disable it.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Welcome to the Battery Megathread, where you can find information and get assistance with any battery-related issues your Pixel might be facing. *All battery-related posts made outside this megathread will be removed.*\n\nBefore you make a comment, try these troubleshooting tips:\n\n###Stay up to date with the latest version of Android and your apps.\nAlthough some people may argue that a system update ruined their battery life (and occasionally this is the cause), it's always a good idea to make sure you device is running the latest version of Android (check anytime in Settings > System > Advanced > System update > Check for update). Security patches and major updates bring fixes not only for battery-draining bugs, but also protection against viruses and malware that may be stealing your charge, or worse. Individual app updates may also provide performance improvements to your battery.\n\n###Check for power-hungry apps.\nDespite battery-saving features like [Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html), some apps may still be able to drain away your charge undetected. Try the following steps to identify any power-hungry apps.\n\n* Make sure that the \"Apps consuming battery\" notification is enabled, and wait a few minutes to see if it appears. (Find the toggle in Settings > Apps & notifications > See all ___ apps > More options (the triple dot) > Show system > Android system > Notifications > Other)\n* Check the battery usage of your apps in Settings > Battery > More options (the triple dot) > Battery usage. Remember that battery life may be reduced with usage of certain features (location, Bluetooth, etc.) and apps (gaming, video, etc.).\n* Turn on battery optimizations for all apps, (Under Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special app access > Battery optimization, and tap each app to change it to *Optimize*), and also enable Adaptive Battery, which limits rarely used apps (Under Settings > Battery > Adaptive Battery).\n* Force stop or uninstall any new apps and monitor battery life. (You can do this by going into Settings > search for *appName* & select *appName*)\n* Temporarily disable all installed apps with Safe Mode, to see if an existing/updated app is the problem. (Enter Safe Mode by pressing & holding the power button, and then pressing and holding *Restart*, and finally tapping OK. To exit Safe Mode, restart your phone as normal. You may have to sign into some apps again.) If your battery life improves, use the aforementioned methods on older apps.\n\n###Investigate battery intensive features.\nSome functions on you phone may use more power than you expect, especially in different scenarios. Take a look at this list for **a few** possibilities:\n\n* **Bluetooth** is notorious for its high-energy usage, especially when actively transferring data. Turn it off if it's not needed, and if you do, consider looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, which need much less power.\n* **Location** also uses quite a bit in order to pinpoint your position. Turn off Wifi/Cellular data/Bluetooth location accuracy (Settings > Security and Location > Location > Advanced > Battery saving > Google Location Accuracy) or turn Location off completely.\n* **Cellular** can also drain your battery when the signal is weak. At these times, more electricity is needed to stay connected, no matter if you're in the forest or underground. If you don't require a cellular connection (for example, if you have Wifi Calling), put your phone into Airplane mode and re-enable Wifi/Bluetooth if needed.\n\n###Contact Google Support.\nGoogle's dedicated Pixel support team may be able to help diagnose and fix your issue. Find them in Settings > Tips & Support, or just ask your Google Assistant \"troubleshoot my battery\".\n\n###IF ALL ELSE FAILS, factory reset your phone.\nSometimes wiping your phone is all that's needed to bring your battery back to life. Google Drive and Google Photos do a decent job with keeping your apps and data (check in Settings > Google > Backup > Back up now **and check** Google Photos > sidebar (the three lines) > Settings > Backup and sync), but ***please personally make sure that everything is backed up to something off your phone.*** To wipe your phone, [follow the steps here.](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4596836)\n\n*This megathread will be replaced on the 1^st of each month at 10:00 UTC.

The speakers are now making a loud popping sound while scrolling through YouTube reel's and Instagram videos. I think I has to do with overlapping sounds or the switch to a different video. It either happens when I go to click on comments or even when my phone pops up with a notification and vibrates, even when I swipe for a different video it did this. This has never happened before and only when I just got the new update and it's been happing multiple times within just a few minutes. I feel if this keeps happening it'll cause real damage to my speaker since it's a loud pop sound and that can easily wear it out and bust it.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "title": "My long-term experience with the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra (and why I still love it)",
    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

I really wish I could've found a good reason to keep it because I loved the flip factor, I can run with it and go hiking without feeling a big bulk bouncing around in my pocket. My main complaints were the short battery life and longer time to charge, camera quality, and phone temperature during regular use/charging (it gets really warm on the outter screen). Maybe sometime in the future Samsung will bring the Z series closer to the ultra given their higher pricing. ",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

I absolutely love it, i put it on the wall and its nicely up there.\n\nMy only concern is, the 2 top screws only screwed in a few turns before becoming tight. No cross thread as I pulled it out and did it again on both 2 or 3 times to be certain.\n\nHas anyone else found that the thread depth isn't very deep on the top 2 screws for mounting?\n\nConsidering taking it down and quadruple checking but wanting to leave it.\n\nIts been 24 hours now, no movement so want to leave it on the wall but the anxiety in the back of my mind tells me otherwise. I fear ill keep going in circles and eventually ruin it myself.\n\nMake me feel better please haha.\n\n❤️",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two?

Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I know my watch is a little older at this point. But I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to get it working again?\n\n  \nI only had it for a few months and then thought I had lost it, so I haven't wanted to buy another one. Found out a family member had mistakenly boxed it up, and found it and told me. Problem is, it's been in that box for like 3 years lol.\n\nSo it's practically brand new, not a scratch on it. But after leaving it on a known good charger (tested with my sisters watch to make sure it still worked), for a whole day, I can't get it to turn on.\n\nMy assumption was the battery was shot after not being charged for so long, and since I have worked in tech repair for years, I was confident to do the repair myself. So I bought the parts, and swapped the battery, stuck it back on the charger for a few hours and... nothing still..\n\nIs there anything else anyone can think to try? Maybe the second battery I got was also bad? Or do I just have an expensive fidget toy at this point?\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

It doesn't even measure it at times and does not even detect if I'm wearing it.\n\nECG is straight up garbage now, the sensors on the buttons are cooked and it starts recording before I even place my finger and there's way too much noise to extract any conceivable data from the already lackluster single lead measurement.                                                                                           \n\n  \nSo what made me realise this ? For a change I started wearing my father's 4+ year old Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and I was surprised how fast the sensors started to react, heart rate and resting HR is on point compared to medical instruments and ECG has way less noise.\n\nBoth (GW7 and Ultra) watches used to super accurate, I have no idea whats going on with it now, GW7 is on the last OneUI 6.0 update while GWU is on the latest 8. Anyone else experiencing the same ? Could it be that the sensors are degrading on its own ? (if thats even possible).",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, first time Samsung owner here. I just purchased the fold 7 and galaxy watch ultra. I'm wondering how to connect the watch to Pokémon go to count my steps so I can hatch eggs, accumulate steps and earn rewards in Pokémon go. When I was using my iPhone and apple watch it just connected automatically and I didn't have to do anything other than toggle the the location service to always on in the Pokémon go app. I have that toggled on now but for some reason it's not linking to my watch and counting my steps. Has anyone had this same issue or knows how to fix this? Appreciate the help in advance 😁 ",

Every time, it's a new photo photo selected and framed automatically. Is there a similar app or feature for Galaxy Watch?

It doesn't update and frame those automatically like her apple watch seems to do. Having to select photos manually everytime defeats the novelty of finding something unexpected each time you look at your watch, besides making it much more time-consuming...",

On the watch8 the home button and back button have swapped, which has been caused in a bit of issues, which I'm unable to fix because I can't figure out a way to swap them back to how it was on the old watch. I've been waking up two alarms and trying to turn them off through muscle memory while I'm asleep, which in turn leads to me accidentally dialing emergency services at 6:00 a.m. when I'm just trying to wake up. This is happening maybe at least once a week if not more. Is there a way to either swap the buttons so I don't accidentally dial 911 every morning as a wake-up call, or is there to swap the function of the back button and the home button press?",

BTW you cannot set up kids mode without a Samsung phone... And even then the process sucks. \nThe connectivity has been spotty AF, even outside and we live in Northern Chicago area with excellent coverage. \nThe last straw was when the 8yo accidentally left their watch at school but wasn't sure exactly when/where it might be. And the Find Hub placed it repeatedly at a coffee shop over a mile away. Leading us to believe it has been taken away from school by another child (not necessarily theft per semester). \n\nIt turned out to have stayed at school. \n\nLocation tracking that repeatedly updates to a place over a mile away is not acceptable for something explicitly intended to help parents have a modicum of ability to know where their kids might be in the event of an urgent situation or simply to check  in on their travels on public transit. \n\n[Edit] and it wouldn't be acceptable for an adult away from their phone either.

    "selftext": "I have noticed that for some watchfaces when in AOD, the anlalog hands work fine but the digital reading is not updating unless it comes out of AOD mode. IT then won't update again until the next time it comes out of AOD mode (a message is recieved or a button is pressed).Yet this happens for some hybrid faces but not all. Also, if I set one of my complications as the digital clock it won't update while in AOD Mode. I have the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic on One UI 6.0. Any body else notice this or have found a fix for this?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nAciss\n\n",

Much better display + speed being the main factors.\n\n\\- In terms of functionality ... for my use, and probably anyone's use, pretty much the same.\n\nBattery; main reason why I didn't upgrade so far,,, 5pro is believed to be the best battery so far... in fact, Ultra seems to be a bit behind (but it's still \"learning\", couple of days only...)\n\nFeel free to ask questions.",

    "selftext": "Hello guys!   \nI know there's a lot of those topics, but it seems that my case is a bit different.   \n  \nSo this January I bought brand new GW5pro  (manufactured at the end of 2023)  from a local chain - updated it to the latest firmware  at the time and used it happily, getting at least 60h of battery life (72 in better days)  with no restrictions, using it like a smart watch - bunch of notifications, constant pulse tracking, GPS activities like running or bicycle, gym exercise tracking, sleep tracking. I used mostly stock apps and watch faces, aside from Spotify maybe. \n\nThen, at the end of September at some point it died on me unexpectedly - clocking in less than 24h from full charge, and battery never got as good as before ever since. \n\nI did all the obvious stuff - cleared cache, done a reset, updated and reinstalled everything, set it up from scratch without restoring backup.  Since it's still under warranty - I reached to the Samsung service, 3 times in total. First they diagnosed it and done a full reset - issue remained. Then I returned it to the store, they sent it to the same Service Center, for them to do another reset, with no result. \n\nThen I reached out to local Samsung support, and they advised to take it back to the service once more - then, when service diagnosed it yet again ('no issues found') - I pressed with my story, and as a part of keeping me loyal, they changes the watch battery and a back plate, returning it to me with stock firmware (one ui 4.5) - I updated it again, and guess what? The watch barely hangs for 30hours from charge to charge. \n\nNothing has changes in my use patterns, no 3rd party apps (aside from Spotify occasionally) were draining battery. My phone (s24U) is doing perfectly fine while the watch does this BS. \n\n*TLDR: Bought a new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with great battery life (60-72 hours). In September, it suddenly dropped to under 24 hours. Despite multiple resets and a warranty repair where Samsung replaced the battery, the problem persists, now lasting only about 30 hours. No changes in usage patterns.*\n\nThank you for everyone who got this through.  Any ideas on how to fix this? Maybe someone had similar issues? ",

For example, if I open the heart rate app on the watch and scroll to the bottom and click the “show on phone” button, it gives an error saying “couldn’t open Samsung health on phone” with a question mark next to the Bluetooth icon in the middle of watch icon and phone icon- however the Bluetooth is definitely connected. \n\nTried all the different suggestions online, clear  cache / data for the app, reset the watch and reconnect, update all the softwares and firmwares, sync to Samsung account, etc. None of them worked. \n\nAny thoughts what could be wrong and how to fix it? Quite frustrating for not being able to make such a basic function to work. Thanks. ",

I'd had it for like 2ish years so I def got my money's worth and I def put a ton of miles on that little bezel, so I'm not surprised. I ordered a Watch 6 Classic (love that bezel, baby!) refurbished from Amazon, just like I did with my Watch 4. \n\nMy concern: I tried to spin the bezel on the Watch 6 Classic and it is significantly tighter. Like, I cannot spin with one finger like I did my old watch. I HAVE to use 2 or 3 fingers and press down a little (insert joke here). My question is, is that normal? Do I need to just wear it loose or is it a defect with the watch and I need to get a replacement? Is the too-tight a feature or a bug? \n\nTL;DR: Watch 6 Classic bezel is tighter than my wife, do I need a new one? ",

But I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to get it working again?\n\n  \nI only had it for a few months and then thought I had lost it, so I haven't wanted to buy another one. Found out a family member had mistakenly boxed it up, and found it and told me. Problem is, it's been in that box for like 3 years lol.\n\nSo it's practically brand new, not a scratch on it. But after leaving it on a known good charger (tested with my sisters watch to make sure it still worked), for a whole day, I can't get it to turn on.\n\nMy assumption was the battery was shot after not being charged for so long, and since I have worked in tech repair for years, I was confident to do the repair myself. So I bought the parts, and swapped the battery, stuck it back on the charger for a few hours and... nothing still..\n\nIs there anything else anyone can think to try? Maybe the second battery I got was also bad? Or do I just have an expensive fidget toy at this point?\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

It doesn't even measure it at times and does not even detect if I'm wearing it.\n\nECG is straight up garbage now, the sensors on the buttons are cooked and it starts recording before I even place my finger and there's way too much noise to extract any conceivable data from the already lackluster single lead measurement.                                                                                           \n\n  \nSo what made me realise this ? For a change I started wearing my father's 4+ year old Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and I was surprised how fast the sensors started to react, heart rate and resting HR is on point compared to medical instruments and ECG has way less noise.\n\nBoth (GW7 and Ultra) watches used to super accurate, I have no idea whats going on with it now, GW7 is on the last OneUI 6.0 update while GWU is on the latest 8. Anyone else experiencing the same ? Could it be that the sensors are degrading on its own ? (if thats even possible).",

    "selftext": "Hello! My wife has an Apple Watch and it has a feature where it shuffles through different photos of the same person in your gallery every day. Every time, it's a new photo photo selected and framed automatically. Is there a similar app or feature for Galaxy Watch? (Mine is a watch 6 classic)\n\nPS: The \"Photos\" watch face that comes with the watch accepts only 20 photos and you have to pre-select them. It doesn't update and frame those automatically like her apple watch seems to do. Having to select photos manually everytime defeats the novelty of finding something unexpected each time you look at your watch, besides making it much more time-consuming...",

Take breaks from your workout and take off your watch periodically to wipe off sweat or other irritants.\"\n\nThis is useless and annoying at the best of times, as it invariably comes as I'm driving home, where the loud *BONG* startles me and then leads to distracted driving as I start wondering if that was an important message. But lately, presumably since the update, I'm getting multiple copies of the same notification. I just cleared my third one.\n\nIt doesn't seem to obey the notification settings for Samsung Health, where I have notifications on but sound off. Not sure what other settings to look at.\n\nI would love to turn this notification off completely. I'd be satisfied if it just arrived without sound. At the absolute minimum I need to get it back down to just a single annoying notification. Ideas?",

Found out a family member had mistakenly boxed it up, and found it and told me. Problem is, it's been in that box for like 3 years lol.\n\nSo it's practically brand new, not a scratch on it. But after leaving it on a known good charger (tested with my sisters watch to make sure it still worked), for a whole day, I can't get it to turn on.\n\nMy assumption was the battery was shot after not being charged for so long, and since I have worked in tech repair for years, I was confident to do the repair myself. So I bought the parts, and swapped the battery, stuck it back on the charger for a few hours and... nothing still..\n\nIs there anything else anyone can think to try? Maybe the second battery I got was also bad? Or do I just have an expensive fidget toy at this point?\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

Seriously,You either have to make a playlist on your phone or listen to whatever random playlists YouTube throws at you.\n\nThen there is this super weird bug where, after 2 or 3 songs, the audio just stops. Shows that it's playing in the app, but there's no sound.\n\nDevice interconnectivity is a fking joke.Spotify switches seamlessly between devices,YouTube Music just everything manual, breaks the flow every single time..",

    "selftext": "I bought the GW7 40mm and Ultra at launch (more than a year ago now I guess). And I noticed both watches' Heart Rate, ECG, Stress and sleep measurements to be completely inaccurate. It doesn't even measure it at times and does not even detect if I'm wearing it.\n\nECG is straight up garbage now, the sensors on the buttons are cooked and it starts recording before I even place my finger and there's way too much noise to extract any conceivable data from the already lackluster single lead measurement.                                                                                           \n\n  \nSo what made me realise this ? For a change I started wearing my father's 4+ year old Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and I was surprised how fast the sensors started to react, heart rate and resting HR is on point compared to medical instruments and ECG has way less noise.\n\nBoth (GW7 and Ultra) watches used to super accurate, I have no idea whats going on with it now, GW7 is on the last OneUI 6.0 update while GWU is on the latest 8. Anyone else experiencing the same ? Could it be that the sensors are degrading on its own ? (if thats even possible).",

Audio does play from headphones, but only the from the right channel.\n\nI’m incredibly new to doing any sort of terminal work, so aside from checking various sites for help, I admittedly relied on chatgpt for a decent amount of the diagnostic work/attempted fixes.\nIt appears that ALSA and pipewire are detecting codec normally, and I’m assuming there is some issue (routing issue?) with the Realtek ALC269VC.\n\nSome system info:\nMachine: Panasonic Let’s Note CF-SX3\nCodec: Realtek ALC269VC\nKernel: Tested on 6.8 and 6.9 (Ubuntu generic)\nAudio stack: PipeWire 1.2.x / ALSA 1.2.9\n\n\nI’ve tried the following:\n\n1. ALSA model overrides in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf:\n2. Reloading drivers/restarting audio\n3. Mixer verification (amixer -c 1)\n\n+ some other random stuff that I don’t fully understand. \n\n\nAdditional info:\n\n“Speaker” sink appears active in pipewire, but no audio\nspeaker-test produces output in terminal but no sound\naplay and pactl show correct devices and sinks\nBoth speaker (0x14) and headphone (0x15) have DefAssociation = 0x1.\nIt appears internal speaker (0x14) and headphone (0x15) share same association\n\nI'd really love to get audio working on this thing again, however, I feel like I have reached a massive impasse.

It's too heavy to carry in a bag, and I also need to lug around the charging adapter, which also adds weight.\n\nFor me, a laptop should meet the following criteria: battery life (more than 8 hours without charging), lightweight (approximately 1.5 kg), quiet operation (passive cooling is possible; I don't want to hear fan noise), and a small size that fits in a bag (13-14 inches). A small and lightweight charging adapter is also a plus. A metal case is also a possibility.\n\nI'm currently considering a MacBook Air 13 (M1, 2020), perhaps even a used one.

So I’m a bit confused about which exact models actually include it (if anyone knows how to confirm before buying, I’d appreciate it!).\n\nPrice-wise, I’ve seen the Vivobook 15 range from around $700 to $1,000 USD, depending on the configuration. What would you say is a fair price for a good mid-range setup (something like an i5/i7 and 16-24GB RAM)?\n\nAlso, if anyone has owned one for a while, how’s the battery life, thermals, and build quality? I’ve heard mixed things about the battery in particular.\n\nAny advice or personal experiences would really help before I drop the money on it. Thanks!\n",

Now, the replacement laptop has gotten pretty slow. I’m wondering if I am able to switch the display on the replacement with the other one, because it was still fairly new before the incident. Is it possible? If so, am I able to do it easily at home or would I have to take it to a shop? How much would you estimate the cost to come out to if I took it to a shop?

However I am new to the Linux system as I have it on my pc, but going through everything and understanding the terminal gives me a headache, so I prefer using mint, but I don't mind trying Ubuntu. What also throws me off is the fact that they look like old computers, I want sum sleek and kinda modern with a good amount of ports, and can do casual gaming. I don't like mac and windows, idm dell or hp but they give me a corporate job feel. Also if you know any website or apps to get resouble technology other than eBay pleace list them.\n\nThank you",

He uses his laptop for work. He audits companies, which usually involves just filling out Excel or a program that his company uses to fill out data.   \nI want to buy him something less than 800 CAD (less than 550 USD). I want it to be something that is very lightweight and has good battery life. I don't think he need a lot of processing from his laptop. \n\nI really find all of these specs confusing. Do you have any recommendations based on what I said about him?",

    "selftext": "I'm planning to go on a backpacking trip quite soon and I was looking on eBay for cheap laptops to take along. \n\nThe issue is that I'm also a freelance designer and I want to work on my portfolio on the go. For Adobe, Rhino (no ARM), Affinity I figure I need atleast 16RAM, 32 is hard to find for cheap, and I don't want to take a 1.500€+ device around the globe right now. Also has to be thin and lightweight. I already bought a Surface Go 3 - lovely device but too small, too weak. \n\nI found two good offers in my city and need to make a quick decision.\n\nNr 1: \nSurface Pro 7, 12,3\", 16RAM, i5-1035G4, 256gb, Intel Iris Plus Graphics -- for approx 400€ (maybe I can bargain)\n\nNr 2.\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga (3rd Gen), 14\", 16RAM, i5-8th Gen., 256gb , Intel UHD Graphics -- 180€ (maybe can bargain)\n\nBoth are kinda refurbished with good battery life. Both convertible (need that for illustrations). \n\nI'm super unsure if 12,3\" will be too small for work, but also of the Lenovo is too bulky, even tho it's only 1,3kg or so. I love the design of the surface go, so thinking of going with the pro, but pro maybe more a target for theft and maybe not as durable... Also more pricy. On the pro side I think it's better to resell. Also nicer as a overall decide to make notes etc.\n\nWhat do you all think. I wish I could get a really good one for my work but I am still too scared of breaking it or it being stolen. :/ currently I have a surface book 2, 15\" that is way too heavy and both batteries are death and touchscreen doesn't work. So I anyway need a proper replace in the future, but maybe that will be a company device then. \n\nThanks! \n",

I thought about replacing my MacBook because it’s about $180 on eBay but I don’t know. I wanted to see if I could get some suggestions. I love the keyboard I have at home, it’s a gaming keyboard with the perfect click, so I’d want a laptop with that but it’s not a deal breaker. I just mainly want something I can use to write and work on slides, but doesn’t look or feel like a Chromebook. Thank you!",

I'm tired of having computers that doesn't last me more than some years and i'm looking for a new one.\n\n  \nA lot of people suggest me to buy a macbook but i'm not sure if I want to spend around 1000 in a laptop (only to watch youtube videos and being on reddit), but some people told me that windows computer tense to slow down very quickly (and not macbook). So here's my question is it possible to find an around 500 laptop that will last me for years ? or is it not enought money ? Thank you everyone !  ",

I’m in the UK and I am in need of help as mine is not cooling down and I need to study for an AAT exam I have next week. I went to turn the laptop on and I noticed it wouldn’t,  then realised even though it hasn’t been used all day as I’ve been at work, that it’s warm on the base and in two areas rather hot. No one uses this one either, just me. \n\nLast night I did some late night studying, now usually I remember to shut down the laptop but last night I didn’t, I’ve gone to use it today and first thing I noticed is the underneath is warm, with two areas of it hot. \n\nFirst thing I did was turn off the switch at the plug, then disconnected the charger from laptop, then unplugged charger from mains and separated it from the charging battery. It was slightly warm but not like the laptop. I’ve flipped my laptop upside down to air out the bottom of it in hopes it cools. I’ve circled the area in green that’s warm and circled the areas that are the hottest. \n\nIt’s been disconnected for about 10 minutes and there’s not been a change in temperature the surrounding areas out side of what’s circled are cool and so is the charger. There’s no smoke, no iffy smell it’s just not cooling down at all and it’s completely off. I’ve checked for dust and used compressed air and there’s been nothing noticeable on that. \n\nDoes any one have any ideas on what I can do?  Thanks in advance! ",

Audio does play from headphones, but only the from the right channel.\n\nI’m incredibly new to doing any sort of terminal work, so aside from checking various sites for help, I admittedly relied on chatgpt for a decent amount of the diagnostic work/attempted fixes.\nIt appears that ALSA and pipewire are detecting codec normally, and I’m assuming there is some issue (routing issue?) with the Realtek ALC269VC.\n\nSome system info:\nMachine: Panasonic Let’s Note CF-SX3\nCodec: Realtek ALC269VC\nKernel: Tested on 6.8 and 6.9 (Ubuntu generic)\nAudio stack: PipeWire 1.2.x / ALSA 1.2.9\n\n\nI’ve tried the following:\n\n1. ALSA model overrides in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf:\n2. Reloading drivers/restarting audio\n3. Mixer verification (amixer -c 1)\n\n+ some other random stuff that I don’t fully understand. \n\n\nAdditional info:\n\n“Speaker” sink appears active in pipewire, but no audio\nspeaker-test produces output in terminal but no sound\naplay and pactl show correct devices and sinks\nBoth speaker (0x14) and headphone (0x15) have DefAssociation = 0x1.\nIt appears internal speaker (0x14) and headphone (0x15) share same association\n\nI'd really love to get audio working on this thing again, however, I feel like I have reached a massive impasse.

It's too heavy to carry in a bag, and I also need to lug around the charging adapter, which also adds weight.\n\nFor me, a laptop should meet the following criteria: battery life (more than 8 hours without charging), lightweight (approximately 1.5 kg), quiet operation (passive cooling is possible; I don't want to hear fan noise), and a small size that fits in a bag (13-14 inches). A small and lightweight charging adapter is also a plus. A metal case is also a possibility.\n\nI'm currently considering a MacBook Air 13 (M1, 2020), perhaps even a used one. I'd like to know if there are similar Windows laptops under $800 that have similar battery life, are thin, light, and quiet.",

So I’m a bit confused about which exact models actually include it (if anyone knows how to confirm before buying, I’d appreciate it!).\n\nPrice-wise, I’ve seen the Vivobook 15 range from around $700 to $1,000 USD, depending on the configuration. What would you say is a fair price for a good mid-range setup (something like an i5/i7 and 16-24GB RAM)?\n\nAlso, if anyone has owned one for a while, how’s the battery life, thermals, and build quality? I’ve heard mixed things about the battery in particular.\n\nAny advice or personal experiences would really help before I drop the money on it. Thanks!\n",

The laptop was unfortunately stepped on by a family member and the display is broken. At the time I had decided not to get it repaired because the estimated cost of repair was far more expensive than just purchasing a new one (silly, I know). Now, the replacement laptop has gotten pretty slow. I’m wondering if I am able to switch the display on the replacement with the other one, because it was still fairly new before the incident. Is it possible? If so, am I able to do it easily at home or would I have to take it to a shop? How much would you estimate the cost to come out to if I took it to a shop?

However I am new to the Linux system as I have it on my pc, but going through everything and understanding the terminal gives me a headache, so I prefer using mint, but I don't mind trying Ubuntu. What also throws me off is the fact that they look like old computers, I want sum sleek and kinda modern with a good amount of ports, and can do casual gaming. I don't like mac and windows, idm dell or hp but they give me a corporate job feel. Also if you know any website or apps to get resouble technology other than eBay pleace list them.\n\nThank you",

He audits companies, which usually involves just filling out Excel or a program that his company uses to fill out data.   \nI want to buy him something less than 800 CAD (less than 550 USD). I want it to be something that is very lightweight and has good battery life. I don't think he need a lot of processing from his laptop. \n\nI really find all of these specs confusing. Do you have any recommendations based on what I said about him?",

    "selftext": "I'm planning to go on a backpacking trip quite soon and I was looking on eBay for cheap laptops to take along. \n\nThe issue is that I'm also a freelance designer and I want to work on my portfolio on the go. For Adobe, Rhino (no ARM), Affinity I figure I need atleast 16RAM, 32 is hard to find for cheap, and I don't want to take a 1.500€+ device around the globe right now. Also has to be thin and lightweight. I already bought a Surface Go 3 - lovely device but too small, too weak. \n\nI found two good offers in my city and need to make a quick decision.\n\nNr 1: \nSurface Pro 7, 12,3\", 16RAM, i5-1035G4, 256gb, Intel Iris Plus Graphics -- for approx 400€ (maybe I can bargain)\n\nNr 2.\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga (3rd Gen), 14\", 16RAM, i5-8th Gen., 256gb , Intel UHD Graphics -- 180€ (maybe can bargain)\n\nBoth are kinda refurbished with good battery life. Both convertible (need that for illustrations). \n\nI'm super unsure if 12,3\" will be too small for work, but also of the Lenovo is too bulky, even tho it's only 1,3kg or so. I love the design of the surface go, so thinking of going with the pro, but pro maybe more a target for theft and maybe not as durable... Also more pricy. On the pro side I think it's better to resell. Also nicer as a overall decide to make notes etc.\n\nWhat do you all think. I wish I could get a really good one for my work but I am still too scared of breaking it or it being stolen. :/ currently I have a surface book 2, 15\" that is way too heavy and both batteries are death and touchscreen doesn't work. So I anyway need a proper replace in the future, but maybe that will be a company device then. \n\nThanks! \n",

My RTX 5080 came with an adapter that is 12 pin that goes into the card that takes 3 PCI E connectors. But my motherboard also has pci e power 1 connector on it at the bottom. That means I would need 4 PCI E connectors so I’m short one. I can’t seem to find anything official and all I see are people having success and not having success with not plugging anything into pci e power 1. I also see the PSU came with a 12 pin PCI E Gen 5 cable that has 600W printed on it. So am I supposed to order more cables to have four or am I supposed to plug in that single 600w pci e gen 5 12 pin cable directly into my 5080 completely bypassing having to use the  3 PCI E connector adapter?",

I'm also interested in running mods if at all possible.

My main concern is if these components are a good enough choice right now for a budget build, and if they work well together. pcpartpicker says they're compatible, but is it a *good* combination?\n\nI'm not a gamer so this is meant mostly for office work, watching movies, and then occasionally trying out some games if/when I feel like it. No Cyberpunk or anything. Maybe the Witcher 3 at most, i'm a fan of the books, maybe the game could help me recover from the mess of the netflix series. i'm thinking of dual booting windows and linux, so if that's something that affects my choices, let me know.\n\nI'm on a 800€ budget, so i'm going with AM4 and using a stock cooler. Haven't settled on a case yet, but i'll probably go with something on the smaller side. doesn't matter to me as much as getting the components right. \n\n**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6 GHz 6-Core Processor  \n**GPU:** Asus DUAL OC V2 GeForce RTX 3050 8GB 8 GB Video Card  \n**Motherboard:** MSI B550M PRO-VDH WIFI Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard   \n**Memory:** G.Skill Trident Z Neo 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3000 CL16 Memory  \n**Storage:** Crucial P3 Plus 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive  \n**PSU:** Corsair CX (2023) 550 W 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power Supply\n\nwhich adds up to a **total** of **€639.97**, and plus some €100 for a case and €30 or so for case fans, should keep me comfortably under €800 if I buy everything now.",

I'm sure it'll make some of you reading this chuckle seeing just how old these parts are.\n\n\\- CPU: Intel(R) Core i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz, 4001 Mhz, 4 Cores, 8 Logical Processors\n\n\\- Motherboard: ASRock Z97 Extreme 6\n\n\\- RAM: 32 GB\n\n\\- BIOS Version/Date: American Megatrends Inc.

Definitely won't get that with my budget anyhow. I'm thinking of a budget around $2-3K. Not sure what that'll get me with how crazy some of the pricing out there is. Additionally, I think I need a new dedicated monitor to boot. \n\nAlso, will waiting until Black Friday / Cyber Monday help me at all? Unsure if it's smart to wait until then or until after that weekend. Thanks folks.",

I only want WiFi capability on the MOBO and I don't think I'd ever utilise 64GB RAM. I just kept seeing it recommended over 32GB when choosing the CPU/GPU combo I chose. Is there any reason for this? The storage would also only be used for games, everything else is clouded, so 1TB will be enough.\n\nI really don't know much about cases, cooling or power supplies. Just threw in a fractal at the moment. Is there anything I should look out for, or would making it compatible be the only mandatory thought? I dislike flashy colours, so I'm looking for a very plain or enclosed case. Airflow and functionality matters more for me.\n\nMy budget is supposed to stay under 3k, but Australian prices are ludicrous at the moment. I also run 2x 1440p monitors. Thank you",

I am just stuck on how to approach this new PC. \n\nBefore I rant, here's my \"new PC criteria\" (just what I'm looking to get): \n\n* For CPU, either a Ryzen 5 9600x, Ryzen 7 9700x, Intel i5-14600k, or an Intel i7-14700k (*Will most likely end up with an AMD processor, just deciding between a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7)*\n* RTX 5070 GPU\n* 2TB M.2 SSD\n* Block air cooler (not AIO, cuz cheaper ig)\n* 32GB of ram to update to 64 in the future\n* 650w - 750w PSU (depending on system) \n* Going to use my current Corsair case to build in. \n\nI have budgeted $1500 for a new PC, but would def like to stay under, maybe closer to the $1300 mark. I wanna game at a higher quality that what my current system allows, and want to get into the 1440p realm too. Looking to play the new BF6 and other games like Helldivers 2, but also allow my wife to multi-task with her homework having multiple spreadsheets open. \n\nHad the thought of going to Microcenter and hand picking out the parts (planned ahead of time) just because I've never been there before and I'd thought it'd be pretty cool. With black Friday coming up I was thinking of taking advantage of deals that Microcenter might have. Plus, I saw microcenter do these good deals where they bundle a CPU and motherboard together at a discounted price (which seems worth it compared to buying the parts separate). However, I'm not sure the deals at Microcenter would be significant enough to go around black friday, especially if it's going to be crazy and hectic. I live an 1 hour and 15 minutes or so from my nearest microcenter. \n\nAnother option I had was to just go with old faithful and use [PCPartPicker.com](http://PCPartPicker.com) and be able to pick from a wide variety of stores (either around black friday or cyber monday) and possibly get better deals and cheaper prices. \n\nLastly, I thought of an option to combine the two. Go to microcenter and buy key components (GPU/CPU/Motherboard etc.), then shop online for the other components (storage, cooling, PSU, RAM). \n\nAnyone with experience with Microcenter or just general advice that could offer another perspective? I'm stuck between these three options and more...haha\n\nThank you so much!!",

I have been building PC’s for many years and have been doing mild overclocking on intel cpu’s for many years but up until these new chips since 12thgen i have been having trouble getting a near 100% static overclock with ought major fluctuations in frequency. My frequencies underload during gaming are fluctuating between 5.6 and 5.1ghz with really decent temps around 55 and 65°C and for the life of me i cannot figure out why with all of my manual settings already set and great temps. \n\nMy Goal: a tight + - 50mhz give or take fluctuation would be the dream to achieve a near perfect static clock.\n\nMy Manual settings: \n\n1. Ai overclock tuner = Manual\n2. Xmp profile = Manual setting DDR5 ram running at 6000mhz stable with original xmp II profile values i set manually.\n3. P cores = Sync all core ratio limit set to 5.6ghz\n    E cores = Sync all core ratio limit set to 4.3ghz\n4. Vcore override = 1.35\n5. LLC = Level 4, ( recommend for oc ) by asus\n6. PL1 and PL2 at 253watts, 307a current limit\n7. Thermal velocity boost disabled\n8. All C states disabled\n9. All intel speed-step, speed-shift, turbo boost technology disabled. \n“Turbo mode” is the only turbo setting that has to stay enabled because cpu will down-clock to base frequencies with it off \n\nIm probably missing a couple of settings here and there. I will update it as soon as I get home posted this while I was at work. \n\nBench test - Cinebench R23 10 minutes multicore test STABLE with a score of 32999, highest Temperature  was 80 to 82°C under full 100% load all cores. ( 5.6ghz down to 5.1ghz still persists underload )\n\nGaming test - 50°C and 68°C, 20% - 55% utilization ( 5.6ghz down to 5.1ghz still persists underload) \n\nGames - warzone, battlefield 6, marvel Rivals, any game really.\n\nThese are wonderful results!, but my only issue here is my Pcore frequencies drop down to 5.1 GHz from 5.6ghz and Ecore down to 4.1ghz from 4.3ghz for the duration of the test consistently under full load or gaming load. \n\nI cannot for the life of me figure out why this is happening. I would like to get to atleast nice fixed static frequency of at least 5.5 GHz or 5.6ghz all pcore with minimal frequency, fluctuations for example only +- 50mhz, withought the drop of frequency during load. \n\nIf there is anyone out there with a solution please help me i am lost at this point. I can upload pics of hwinfo and everything soon as Im home. \n\nThank you in advanced for the help\n\n\n",

I don't care about aesthetics, I just want pure and raw power. I was looking for a build that could be easily upgraded in the future with newer pieces so I tried also to make a build with an AM5 chipset but it came out too expensive. I was wandering if someone could help me to improve this build before I buy the pieces or should I try to make a build with an AM5 chipset instead so it's easier to upgrade in the future? If so what pieces should I use? \n\nI could spend a little bit more(max850-900€) only if it means to still make a good build at a reasonable price and that can be easily upgraded in the future with newer parts without replacing too many pieces or something like the motherboard. I thought that with an AM5 build could be possible but I couldn't make one with my budget so I wanted to try to ask advice online. If it's possible to do an AM5 build with my budget then I would be happy to take any suggestions but if not then what could be more optimized in my current build?\n\nTo anyone who wanted to help me keep in mind that I live in Italy so I don't have the same prices and availability as in America",

    "selftext": "Playing unmodded Skyrim, I've been experiencing some annoying FPS spikes, particularly when I'm outside. I'm able to maintain 60FPS for most of the game, but when I'm outside suddenly it spikes and it can be really disruptive. I was under the impression that my PC was pretty good, I've done benchmark tests and I often get pretty good results.\n\nI just did a performance log, and whenever I have these FPS spikes, I notice a significant drop in GPU utilization, frequency, VRAM frequency, etc. My CPU logs on the other hand seem to be fairly stable.\n\nFor instance, on average my GPU utilization will be around 30% to 40%, but suddenly will drop to 5% which I assume causes the FPS spikes. During this, my CPU utilization on average is 12%, during the FPS spikes it drops to 8% at most. I'm not very good with computers, so I don't understand what this means or what I can do to fix this.\n\nIf it's useful, my GPU and CPU temperatures are both fine, being around 40**°** to 50**°**. So I don't think it's an issue with cooling.\n\nIt's frustrating as like I said, I thought I had a decent PC, but I'm not even being able to play unmodded Skyrim completely smoothly. I know I can't expect 100% smooth gameplay considering my PC has to load things but I dunno, it's really annoying and disruptive. So if anybody can explain what the issue is, or what I could do to improve this, I'd highly appreciate it.\n\nSpecs:\n\nRadeon RX 7800 XT Gaming OC 16GB\n\nAMD Ryzensets 7 5800X Processor (8 core, 16 threads)\n\nCorsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 32GB (2 sticks of 16GB) 3200MHz\n\n",

    "title": "POST fail: CPU+DRAM Debug LEDs (7500F + ASRock B650 PG Lightning build)",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm building a gaming PC by myself for the first time and I would need help from the community. Here's the parts list: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/3dPKfd](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/3dPKfd) (no compatibility issues to be declared as far as PCPartPicker goes)\n\nI've assembled the PC yesterday and when the moment came to turn everything on, I encountered failure on POST with **BOTH** **CPU and DRAM** **debug LEDs staying on**. More details:\n\n* Everything properly plugged in\n   * EPS in P8 — PSU-side — and ATX12V1 on MB side\n   * ATX in the 24-pin\n   * PCIe in the GPU\n   * CPU cooler plugged into CPU\\_FAN1\n   * DisplayPort connected to screen from GPU's port\n   * RAMs properly seated, latches clicked fine (2x16GB, A2-B2 as advised in mobo's manual)\n   * SSD in the M2.1 slot\n   * Front panel connections\n* At startup (turning the PSU on and then pressing case Power button)\n   * Case fans and lights turn on, fans spin at full speed (note they're receiving their separate power straight from the PSU through a SATA cable, not from the mobo)\n   * PSU fan spins full speed for a second and goes low-regime (I can feel the air underneath the case but there's very little sound)\n   * Case Power button LED turns and stays on (I'm pretty sure it's receiving power from the motherboard)\n   * CPU cooler fan DOES NOT spin (at all, and NEVER spun when plugged on CPU\\_FAN1)\n   * CPU AND DRAM debug LEDs are lit red.\n\nNow because I've heard about the DDR5 \"memory training\" first boot times being longer, I waited. I waited for 15+ minutes to rule that out, but nothing changed.\n\nThen I:\n\n1. Removed the A2 RAM to leave only B2 (as advised in my mobo's manual, for single-stick configs) -> same.\n2. Removed all RAM to see if that would change the debug LED code: nope, still CPU+DRAM LEDs shining a solid red.\n\nRemoved the GPU as well because it was in the way and I'd rather put it back in when everything else seems in order.\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/post-fail-cpu-dram-debug-leds-7500f-asrock-b650-pg-v0-6j9fvvjn9pyf1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc6e7e94d131ee26ed7c5e59fe13fc7be919cbd3)\n\nFollowing the PC troubleshooting flowchart at [https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1hfm6w2/is\\_your\\_new\\_pc\\_not\\_working\\_heres\\_a\\_flowchart\\_on/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1hfm6w2/is_your_new_pc_not_working_heres_a_flowchart_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I end up on the \"BIOS flashback\" step. My mobo is equipped with BIOS flashback and I don't mind flashing but I also know from the BIOS motherboard physical sticker that **it came with BIOS version 3.10** which is very recent and WAY ahead of the minimal BIOS versions that I need for compatibility (1.24 for CPU, 1.28 for RAM, respectively), so I don't see how that could make anything different.\n\nI have two questions about quite unlikely culprits:\n\n1. Maximum supported RAM frequency by the 7500F is 5200 MHz. I know that a lot of people run higher frequencies with it though since it's a popular gaming CPU, and I'm sure it shouldn't be an issue at all... except maybe for the first boot ? before \"OC\" options related to CPU/RAM are turned on in BIOS ?\n2. My RAM stick: \"F5-6000J3238F16GX2-TZ5N\" is not on the mobo's QVL. However its RGB variant \"F5-6000J3238F16GX2-TZ5N**R**\" is indeed on the QVL. One could only assume the non-RGB part would work exactly the same regarding compatibility, but please correct me if I'm mistaken.\n\nFinally I've heard that CPU detection problems can arise when the CPU cooler is overtightened. I would doubt I f\\*\\*\\*ed that up: only turned the screw until the spring thing touched the CPU cooler mount, after which I turned an additional quarter of turn, if not less.\n\nCan you think of anything ? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n# Edit / news\n1. Flashed the latest version of the BIOS (despite the factory BIOS being recent enough that it should have already supported CPU and RAM). Didn't change anything.\n2. Cleared CMOS (jumped the header for 15 seconds). Same.\n\n# Notes\n\nTo give you a little context, that's actually my 3rd weekend in a row where I'm shooting a shot at this, and I always encounter the same problem. My last 2 attempts were with a Ryzen 5 5500 CPU and MSI B550-A PRO with DDR4, and no amount of flashing BIOS versions, CMOS clearance, RAM stick switching, or CPU reseating could help me. Note: different manufacturer (MSI vs ASRock) so the debug LED system might be different but I only had the CPU light turned on back then, not the DRAM.\n\nI decided to return the parts and switch for AM5/DDR5 for a more future-proof build, better support on parts that are more popular, and most importantly the AM5 switch to LGA, because I'd rather have the CPU less fragile.\n\nAfter the first two attempts I wondered if the EPS connector was faulty and, with a multimeter, I checked for continuity in the connector as well as proper voltage delivery (\\~11.8V, I assume that's within tolerance) so the EPS connector should be ruled out. With the case fans and LEDs being powered, as well as the PSU fan spinning just fine, **I would rule out issues related to the PSU** (it's also a quality 80+Gold PSU). Some will say it's a low wattage PSU, but my system being estimated at around a 350 wattage, I believe 550W should be enough. Again correct me if I'm wrong. In any case, without GPU plugged in, power output should not be an issue.\n\nI also tried plugging the CPU cooler into the case fans system, and it spun perfectly fine: **I would rule out faulty CPU cooler** (it not being detected would likely prevent the CPU from being powered on).",

I checked some comparisons, but I’m still not sure if that’s really true or if it’s worth switching, considering I mostly play FPS games.\n\nI just want to make sure I’m on the right track before buying everything — any tips, comments, or suggestions would be really appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance! 🙏\n\n⸻\n\nNote: English isn’t my first language, so I used AI to help me write this post more clearly",

I'm not ready to accept defeat and lose my money just yet, so I asked Chatgpt and it told me there are adapters for these cases. Problem is, I haven't been able to find any.\n\nDoes this kind of adapter even exist? And if it does, can someone please point me in the right direction? \n\nThe cooler is an Assassin X 120 Refined SE ARGB (LGA 1700) and the motherboard is an ASUS Prime B550M-A WiFi II.\n\nThanks in advance for your help, and sorry for being a noob!",

I got the case used, it's much larger than I expected but will work for now, maybe I'll work on a smaller build in the future.\n\nI'm hoping to use this for some music production, hobby coding, building an LLM, and some gaming. I have all the parts except the processor which is arriving this week.\n\nMy only concern is the memory I got says Intel, and it sounds like that could cause some issues with the AMD EXPO CPU. From what I understand I may have to manually set the timing and it could work just fine, or it could have issues/not perform at 100%. I don't think I'll be pushing 64GB anytime soon, and I got a decent deal on the memory on eBay, supposedly brand new.\n\nIf anyone has any tips on building a local LLM or good resources you would recommend, I'd love to hear them! My use case is: I'm most interested in learning, understanding how AI/ML works under the hood, but I'll certainly be able to make use of it for data analysis and other projects. I'm pretty psyched about this project, coming from a pretty old windows laptop and I've never been able to afford to do something like this before.\n\n  \n\\[PCPartPicker Part List\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NybRDj)  \n  \nType|Item|Price  \n:----|:----|:----  \n\\*\\*CPU\\*\\* | \\[AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 4.7 GHz 8-Core Processor\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fPyH99/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-47-ghz-8-core-processor-100-1000001084wof) | $467.99 @ Amazon   \n\\*\\*CPU Cooler\\*\\* | \\[ARCTIC Liquid Freezer III Pro A-RGB 360 77 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/hYXMnQ/arctic-liquid-freezer-iii-pro-a-rgb-360-77-cfm-liquid-cpu-cooler-acfre00188a) | $105.49 @ Amazon   \n\\*\\*Motherboard\\*\\* | \\[Asus ROG STRIX B850-A GAMING WIFI ATX AM5 Motherboard\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/d4CCmG/asus-rog-strix-b850-a-gaming-wifi-atx-am5-motherboard-rog-strix-b850-a-gaming-wifi) | $210.35 @ Amazon   \n\\*\\*Memory\\*\\* | \\[Corsair Vengeance RGB 64 GB (2 x 32 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Nn9wrH/corsair-vengeance-rgb-64-gb-2-x-32-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-cmh64gx5m2b6000c30w) | $434.99 @ Corsair   \n\\*\\*Storage\\*\\* | \\[Samsung 990 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/34ytt6/samsung-990-pro-2-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-mz-v9p2t0bw) | $174.99 @ Newegg   \n\\*\\*Video Card\\*\\* | \\[Asus PRIME GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card\\](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Cpbypg/asus-prime-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16-gb-video-card-prime-rtx5070ti-16g) | $749.99 @ Amazon   \n\\*\\*Case\\*\\* | \\[be quiet!

Just getting a bit tired of newer and competitive games all requiring me to play at 20-40 FPS on low settings with a 165 hz monitor. \n\nI was looking at GPUs but it's kind of confusing with different series and price points, like the massive price jump between the 5050 and 5090, or how a 4090 is way more expensive and performant than a 5050, even though 50 series is newer. \n\nThere's also XTs and Tis and Supers and RX and RTX and GTX and different virtual memory, I'm not really sure which is the best. I think only certain GPUs too have certain upscaling techniques and low-latency boosts which sounds nice. I have 32gb of ram and a Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core so I don't think those will be bottlenecks?\n\nRay tracing and 4k isn't that important to me, I just want to reach my 165 hz refresh rate on the settings that'll allow it; but I've also never seen a good visual picture in a modern game so it wouldn't hurt if it can fit in a good price point lol\n\n",

I can get either for about the same price.\n\nMy favourite games include Arma, Squad (main game), HLL, Total War games. I know squad and Arma are CPU heavy and like the x3d CPU’s however I am aware for overall 1440p the 9070xt build is the better. \n\nMy main thoughts are I am aware the 5070 12gb VRAM may not be the most future proof for 1440p however would the 5070 option be better as if I had to upgrade GPU in 4/5 years the 7800x3d is still likely to be a strong CPU especially for 1440p so I’m not running the risk of significant bottle necking and having to upgrade GPU and CPU at the same time. Where as if I went for the 9070xt build if I wanted to upgrade GPU in the future I would also likely need to upgrade the CPU at the same time to avoid a significant CPU bottleneck.\n\nWould be interested in some peoples opinions?",

I am just stuck on how to approach this new PC. \n\nBefore I rant, here's my \"new PC criteria\" (just what I'm looking to get): \n\n* For CPU, either a Ryzen 5 9600x, Ryzen 7 9700x, Intel i5-14600k, or an Intel i7-14700k (*Will most likely end up with an AMD processor, just deciding between a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7)*\n* RTX 5070 GPU\n* 2TB M.2 SSD\n* Block air cooler (not AIO, cuz cheaper ig)\n* 32GB of ram to update to 64 in the future\n* 650w - 750w PSU (depending on system) \n* Going to use my current Corsair case to build in. \n\nI have budgeted $1500 for a new PC, but would def like to stay under, maybe closer to the $1300 mark. I wanna game at a higher quality that what my current system allows, and want to get into the 1440p realm too. Looking to play the new BF6 and other games like Helldivers 2, but also allow my wife to multi-task with her homework having multiple spreadsheets open. \n\nHad the thought of going to Microcenter and hand picking out the parts (planned ahead of time) just because I've never been there before and I'd thought it'd be pretty cool. With black Friday coming up I was thinking of taking advantage of deals that Microcenter might have. Plus, I saw microcenter do these good deals where they bundle a CPU and motherboard together at a discounted price (which seems worth it compared to buying the parts separate). However, I'm not sure the deals at Microcenter would be significant enough to go around black friday, especially if it's going to be crazy and hectic. I live an 1 hour and 15 minutes or so from my nearest microcenter. \n\nAnother option I had was to just go with old faithful and use [PCPartPicker.com](http://PCPartPicker.com) and be able to pick from a wide variety of stores (either around black friday or cyber monday) and possibly get better deals and cheaper prices. \n\nLastly, I thought of an option to combine the two. Go to microcenter and buy key components (GPU/CPU/Motherboard etc.), then shop online for the other components (storage, cooling, PSU, RAM). \n\nAnyone with experience with Microcenter or just general advice that could offer another perspective? I'm stuck between these three options and more...haha\n\nThank you so much!!",

I'm able to maintain 60FPS for most of the game, but when I'm outside suddenly it spikes and it can be really disruptive. I was under the impression that my PC was pretty good, I've done benchmark tests and I often get pretty good results.\n\nI just did a performance log, and whenever I have these FPS spikes, I notice a significant drop in GPU utilization, frequency, VRAM frequency, etc. My CPU logs on the other hand seem to be fairly stable.\n\nFor instance, on average my GPU utilization will be around 30% to 40%, but suddenly will drop to 5% which I assume causes the FPS spikes. During this, my CPU utilization on average is 12%, during the FPS spikes it drops to 8% at most. I'm not very good with computers, so I don't understand what this means or what I can do to fix this.\n\nIf it's useful, my GPU and CPU temperatures are both fine, being around 40**°** to 50**°**. So I don't think it's an issue with cooling.\n\nIt's frustrating as like I said, I thought I had a decent PC, but I'm not even being able to play unmodded Skyrim completely smoothly. I know I can't expect 100% smooth gameplay considering my PC has to load things but I dunno, it's really annoying and disruptive.

    "title": "POST fail: CPU+DRAM Debug LEDs (7500F + ASRock B650 PG Lightning build)",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm building a gaming PC by myself for the first time and I would need help from the community. Here's the parts list: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/3dPKfd](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/3dPKfd) (no compatibility issues to be declared as far as PCPartPicker goes)\n\nI've assembled the PC yesterday and when the moment came to turn everything on, I encountered failure on POST with **BOTH** **CPU and DRAM** **debug LEDs staying on**. More details:\n\n* Everything properly plugged in\n   * EPS in P8 — PSU-side — and ATX12V1 on MB side\n   * ATX in the 24-pin\n   * PCIe in the GPU\n   * CPU cooler plugged into CPU\\_FAN1\n   * DisplayPort connected to screen from GPU's port\n   * RAMs properly seated, latches clicked fine (2x16GB, A2-B2 as advised in mobo's manual)\n   * SSD in the M2.1 slot\n   * Front panel connections\n* At startup (turning the PSU on and then pressing case Power button)\n   * Case fans and lights turn on, fans spin at full speed (note they're receiving their separate power straight from the PSU through a SATA cable, not from the mobo)\n   * PSU fan spins full speed for a second and goes low-regime (I can feel the air underneath the case but there's very little sound)\n   * Case Power button LED turns and stays on (I'm pretty sure it's receiving power from the motherboard)\n   * CPU cooler fan DOES NOT spin (at all, and NEVER spun when plugged on CPU\\_FAN1)\n   * CPU AND DRAM debug LEDs are lit red.\n\nNow because I've heard about the DDR5 \"memory training\" first boot times being longer, I waited. I waited for 15+ minutes to rule that out, but nothing changed.\n\nThen I:\n\n1. Removed the A2 RAM to leave only B2 (as advised in my mobo's manual, for single-stick configs) -> same.\n2. Removed all RAM to see if that would change the debug LED code: nope, still CPU+DRAM LEDs shining a solid red.\n\nRemoved the GPU as well because it was in the way and I'd rather put it back in when everything else seems in order.\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/post-fail-cpu-dram-debug-leds-7500f-asrock-b650-pg-v0-6j9fvvjn9pyf1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc6e7e94d131ee26ed7c5e59fe13fc7be919cbd3)\n\nFollowing the PC troubleshooting flowchart at [https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1hfm6w2/is\\_your\\_new\\_pc\\_not\\_working\\_heres\\_a\\_flowchart\\_on/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1hfm6w2/is_your_new_pc_not_working_heres_a_flowchart_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I end up on the \"BIOS flashback\" step. My mobo is equipped with BIOS flashback and I don't mind flashing but I also know from the BIOS motherboard physical sticker that **it came with BIOS version 3.10** which is very recent and WAY ahead of the minimal BIOS versions that I need for compatibility (1.24 for CPU, 1.28 for RAM, respectively), so I don't see how that could make anything different.\n\nI have two questions about quite unlikely culprits:\n\n1. Maximum supported RAM frequency by the 7500F is 5200 MHz. I know that a lot of people run higher frequencies with it though since it's a popular gaming CPU, and I'm sure it shouldn't be an issue at all... except maybe for the first boot ? before \"OC\" options related to CPU/RAM are turned on in BIOS ?\n2. My RAM stick: \"F5-6000J3238F16GX2-TZ5N\" is not on the mobo's QVL. However its RGB variant \"F5-6000J3238F16GX2-TZ5N**R**\" is indeed on the QVL. One could only assume the non-RGB part would work exactly the same regarding compatibility, but please correct me if I'm mistaken.\n\nFinally I've heard that CPU detection problems can arise when the CPU cooler is overtightened. I would doubt I f\\*\\*\\*ed that up: only turned the screw until the spring thing touched the CPU cooler mount, after which I turned an additional quarter of turn, if not less.\n\nCan you think of anything ? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n# Edit / news\n1. Flashed the latest version of the BIOS (despite the factory BIOS being recent enough that it should have already supported CPU and RAM). Didn't change anything.\n2. Cleared CMOS (jumped the header for 15 seconds). Same.\n\n# Notes\n\nTo give you a little context, that's actually my 3rd weekend in a row where I'm shooting a shot at this, and I always encounter the same problem. My last 2 attempts were with a Ryzen 5 5500 CPU and MSI B550-A PRO with DDR4, and no amount of flashing BIOS versions, CMOS clearance, RAM stick switching, or CPU reseating could help me. Note: different manufacturer (MSI vs ASRock) so the debug LED system might be different but I only had the CPU light turned on back then, not the DRAM.\n\nI decided to return the parts and switch for AM5/DDR5 for a more future-proof build, better support on parts that are more popular, and most importantly the AM5 switch to LGA, because I'd rather have the CPU less fragile.\n\nAfter the first two attempts I wondered if the EPS connector was faulty and, with a multimeter, I checked for continuity in the connector as well as proper voltage delivery (\\~11.8V, I assume that's within tolerance) so the EPS connector should be ruled out. With the case fans and LEDs being powered, as well as the PSU fan spinning just fine, **I would rule out issues related to the PSU** (it's also a quality 80+Gold PSU). Some will say it's a low wattage PSU, but my system being estimated at around a 350 wattage, I believe 550W should be enough. Again correct me if I'm wrong. In any case, without GPU plugged in, power output should not be an issue.\n\nI also tried plugging the CPU cooler into the case fans system, and it spun perfectly fine: **I would rule out faulty CPU cooler** (it not being detected would likely prevent the CPU from being powered on).",

I want to run a Minecraft server with no more than like 4 or 5 people at a time.\n\nCurrently I have parts for an AM4 build. I have the motherboard, ram, cooler, and PSU. I'll need storage, a case, and a cpu with preferably integrated graphics so I don't need to buy a GPU.\n\nI found some listings online for a R3 3200g, and I was wondering how well that would run a Minecraft server. I'm also interested in running mods if at all possible. If the 4c/4t don't hold up, I could also go with a 5600g, but that is around $60 more expensive.\n\nWith that, the build would look something like this:\n\nCPU: R3 3200g OR R5 5600g\n\nMobo: MSI A320M-A Pro\n\nRam: Adata XPG 2x8 gig kit at 3200mhz\n\nStorage: preferably a 512/480 gb SSD, since my board doesn't have m.2 slots\n\nPSU: random 550W PSU I pulled from my old prebuilt\n\n\nAnyone vaguely experienced with servers please help me, and thank you in advance!",

My main concern is if these components are a good enough choice right now for a budget build, and if they work well together. pcpartpicker says they're compatible, but is it a *good* combination?\n\nI'm not a gamer so this is meant mostly for office work, watching movies, and then occasionally trying out some games if/when I feel like it. No Cyberpunk or anything. Maybe the Witcher 3 at most, i'm a fan of the books, maybe the game could help me recover from the mess of the netflix series. i'm thinking of dual booting windows and linux, so if that's something that affects my choices, let me know.\n\nI'm on a 800€ budget, so i'm going with AM4 and using a stock cooler. Haven't settled on a case yet, but i'll probably go with something on the smaller side. doesn't matter to me as much as getting the components right. \n\n**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6 GHz 6-Core Processor  \n**GPU:** Asus DUAL OC V2 GeForce RTX 3050 8GB 8 GB Video Card  \n**Motherboard:** MSI B550M PRO-VDH WIFI Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard   \n**Memory:** G.Skill Trident Z Neo 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3000 CL16 Memory  \n**Storage:** Crucial P3 Plus 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive  \n**PSU:** Corsair CX (2023) 550 W 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power Supply\n\nwhich adds up to a **total** of **€639.97**, and plus some €100 for a case and €30 or so for case fans, should keep me comfortably under €800 if I buy everything now.",

P2.50, 10/6/2015\n\n\\- OS: Windows 10 x64 bit\n\n\\- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB\n\n  \nI'm looking for a new rig that can keep up with most new game releases. I don't need a super fancy build. Definitely won't get that with my budget anyhow. I'm thinking of a budget around $2-3K. Not sure what that'll get me with how crazy some of the pricing out there is. Additionally, I think I need a new dedicated monitor to boot. \n\nAlso, will waiting until Black Friday / Cyber Monday help me at all? Unsure if it's smart to wait until then or until after that weekend. Thanks folks.",

Just getting a bit tired of newer and competitive games all requiring me to play at 20-40 FPS on low settings with a 165 hz monitor. \n\nI was looking at GPUs but it's kind of confusing with different series and price points, like the massive price jump between the 5050 and 5090, or how a 4090 is way more expensive and performant than a 5050, even though 50 series is newer. \n\nThere's also XTs and Tis and Supers and RX and RTX and GTX and different virtual memory, I'm not really sure which is the best. I think only certain GPUs too have certain upscaling techniques and low-latency boosts which sounds nice. I have 32gb of ram and a Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core so I don't think those will be bottlenecks?\n\nRay tracing and 4k isn't that important to me, I just want to reach my 165 hz refresh rate on the settings that'll allow it; but I've also never seen a good visual picture in a modern game so it wouldn't hurt if it can fit in a good price point lol\n\n",

I know squad and Arma are CPU heavy and like the x3d CPU’s however I am aware for overall 1440p the 9070xt build is the better. \n\nMy main thoughts are I am aware the 5070 12gb VRAM may not be the most future proof for 1440p however would the 5070 option be better as if I had to upgrade GPU in 4/5 years the 7800x3d is still likely to be a strong CPU especially for 1440p so I’m not running the risk of significant bottle necking and having to upgrade GPU and CPU at the same time. Where as if I went for the 9070xt build if I wanted to upgrade GPU in the future I would also likely need to upgrade the CPU at the same time to avoid a significant CPU bottleneck.\n\nWould be interested in some peoples opinions?",

    "title": "Advice on how to approach buying parts for new PC build",
    "selftext": "So I am looking to upgrade my PC. Currently have a old setup, i5-9600k + rtx2060 and other outdated components. I am just stuck on how to approach this new PC. \n\nBefore I rant, here's my \"new PC criteria\" (just what I'm looking to get): \n\n* For CPU, either a Ryzen 5 9600x, Ryzen 7 9700x, Intel i5-14600k, or an Intel i7-14700k (*Will most likely end up with an AMD processor, just deciding between a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7)*\n* RTX 5070 GPU\n* 2TB M.2 SSD\n* Block air cooler (not AIO, cuz cheaper ig)\n* 32GB of ram to update to 64 in the future\n* 650w - 750w PSU (depending on system) \n* Going to use my current Corsair case to build in. \n\nI have budgeted $1500 for a new PC, but would def like to stay under, maybe closer to the $1300 mark. I wanna game at a higher quality that what my current system allows, and want to get into the 1440p realm too. Looking to play the new BF6 and other games like Helldivers 2, but also allow my wife to multi-task with her homework having multiple spreadsheets open. \n\nHad the thought of going to Microcenter and hand picking out the parts (planned ahead of time) just because I've never been there before and I'd thought it'd be pretty cool. With black Friday coming up I was thinking of taking advantage of deals that Microcenter might have. Plus, I saw microcenter do these good deals where they bundle a CPU and motherboard together at a discounted price (which seems worth it compared to buying the parts separate). However, I'm not sure the deals at Microcenter would be significant enough to go around black friday, especially if it's going to be crazy and hectic. I live an 1 hour and 15 minutes or so from my nearest microcenter. \n\nAnother option I had was to just go with old faithful and use [PCPartPicker.com](http://PCPartPicker.com) and be able to pick from a wide variety of stores (either around black friday or cyber monday) and possibly get better deals and cheaper prices. \n\nLastly, I thought of an option to combine the two. Go to microcenter and buy key components (GPU/CPU/Motherboard etc.), then shop online for the other components (storage, cooling, PSU, RAM). \n\nAnyone with experience with Microcenter or just general advice that could offer another perspective? I'm stuck between these three options and more...haha\n\nThank you so much!!",

    "selftext": "Playing unmodded Skyrim, I've been experiencing some annoying FPS spikes, particularly when I'm outside. I'm able to maintain 60FPS for most of the game, but when I'm outside suddenly it spikes and it can be really disruptive. I was under the impression that my PC was pretty good, I've done benchmark tests and I often get pretty good results.\n\nI just did a performance log, and whenever I have these FPS spikes, I notice a significant drop in GPU utilization, frequency, VRAM frequency, etc. My CPU logs on the other hand seem to be fairly stable.\n\nFor instance, on average my GPU utilization will be around 30% to 40%, but suddenly will drop to 5% which I assume causes the FPS spikes. During this, my CPU utilization on average is 12%, during the FPS spikes it drops to 8% at most. I'm not very good with computers, so I don't understand what this means or what I can do to fix this.\n\nIf it's useful, my GPU and CPU temperatures are both fine, being around 40**°** to 50**°**. So I don't think it's an issue with cooling.\n\nIt's frustrating as like I said, I thought I had a decent PC, but I'm not even being able to play unmodded Skyrim completely smoothly. I know I can't expect 100% smooth gameplay considering my PC has to load things but I dunno, it's really annoying and disruptive. So if anybody can explain what the issue is, or what I could do to improve this, I'd highly appreciate it.\n\nSpecs:\n\nRadeon RX 7800 XT Gaming OC 16GB\n\nAMD Ryzensets 7 5800X Processor (8 core, 16 threads)\n\nCorsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 32GB (2 sticks of 16GB) 3200MHz\n\n",

    "title": "POST fail: CPU+DRAM Debug LEDs (7500F + ASRock B650 PG Lightning build)",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm building a gaming PC by myself for the first time and I would need help from the community. Here's the parts list: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/3dPKfd](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/3dPKfd) (no compatibility issues to be declared as far as PCPartPicker goes)\n\nI've assembled the PC yesterday and when the moment came to turn everything on, I encountered failure on POST with **BOTH** **CPU and DRAM** **debug LEDs staying on**. More details:\n\n* Everything properly plugged in\n   * EPS in P8 — PSU-side — and ATX12V1 on MB side\n   * ATX in the 24-pin\n   * PCIe in the GPU\n   * CPU cooler plugged into CPU\\_FAN1\n   * DisplayPort connected to screen from GPU's port\n   * RAMs properly seated, latches clicked fine (2x16GB, A2-B2 as advised in mobo's manual)\n   * SSD in the M2.1 slot\n   * Front panel connections\n* At startup (turning the PSU on and then pressing case Power button)\n   * Case fans and lights turn on, fans spin at full speed (note they're receiving their separate power straight from the PSU through a SATA cable, not from the mobo)\n   * PSU fan spins full speed for a second and goes low-regime (I can feel the air underneath the case but there's very little sound)\n   * Case Power button LED turns and stays on (I'm pretty sure it's receiving power from the motherboard)\n   * CPU cooler fan DOES NOT spin (at all, and NEVER spun when plugged on CPU\\_FAN1)\n   * CPU AND DRAM debug LEDs are lit red.\n\nNow because I've heard about the DDR5 \"memory training\" first boot times being longer, I waited. I waited for 15+ minutes to rule that out, but nothing changed.\n\nThen I:\n\n1. Removed the A2 RAM to leave only B2 (as advised in my mobo's manual, for single-stick configs) -> same.\n2. Removed all RAM to see if that would change the debug LED code: nope, still CPU+DRAM LEDs shining a solid red.\n\nRemoved the GPU as well because it was in the way and I'd rather put it back in when everything else seems in order.\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/post-fail-cpu-dram-debug-leds-7500f-asrock-b650-pg-v0-6j9fvvjn9pyf1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc6e7e94d131ee26ed7c5e59fe13fc7be919cbd3)\n\nFollowing the PC troubleshooting flowchart at [https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1hfm6w2/is\\_your\\_new\\_pc\\_not\\_working\\_heres\\_a\\_flowchart\\_on/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1hfm6w2/is_your_new_pc_not_working_heres_a_flowchart_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I end up on the \"BIOS flashback\" step. My mobo is equipped with BIOS flashback and I don't mind flashing but I also know from the BIOS motherboard physical sticker that **it came with BIOS version 3.10** which is very recent and WAY ahead of the minimal BIOS versions that I need for compatibility (1.24 for CPU, 1.28 for RAM, respectively), so I don't see how that could make anything different.\n\nI have two questions about quite unlikely culprits:\n\n1. Maximum supported RAM frequency by the 7500F is 5200 MHz. I know that a lot of people run higher frequencies with it though since it's a popular gaming CPU, and I'm sure it shouldn't be an issue at all... except maybe for the first boot ? before \"OC\" options related to CPU/RAM are turned on in BIOS ?\n2. My RAM stick: \"F5-6000J3238F16GX2-TZ5N\" is not on the mobo's QVL. However its RGB variant \"F5-6000J3238F16GX2-TZ5N**R**\" is indeed on the QVL. One could only assume the non-RGB part would work exactly the same regarding compatibility, but please correct me if I'm mistaken.\n\nFinally I've heard that CPU detection problems can arise when the CPU cooler is overtightened. I would doubt I f\\*\\*\\*ed that up: only turned the screw until the spring thing touched the CPU cooler mount, after which I turned an additional quarter of turn, if not less.\n\nCan you think of anything ? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n# Edit / news\n1. Flashed the latest version of the BIOS (despite the factory BIOS being recent enough that it should have already supported CPU and RAM). Didn't change anything.\n2. Cleared CMOS (jumped the header for 15 seconds). Same.\n\n# Notes\n\nTo give you a little context, that's actually my 3rd weekend in a row where I'm shooting a shot at this, and I always encounter the same problem. My last 2 attempts were with a Ryzen 5 5500 CPU and MSI B550-A PRO with DDR4, and no amount of flashing BIOS versions, CMOS clearance, RAM stick switching, or CPU reseating could help me. Note: different manufacturer (MSI vs ASRock) so the debug LED system might be different but I only had the CPU light turned on back then, not the DRAM.\n\nI decided to return the parts and switch for AM5/DDR5 for a more future-proof build, better support on parts that are more popular, and most importantly the AM5 switch to LGA, because I'd rather have the CPU less fragile.\n\nAfter the first two attempts I wondered if the EPS connector was faulty and, with a multimeter, I checked for continuity in the connector as well as proper voltage delivery (\\~11.8V, I assume that's within tolerance) so the EPS connector should be ruled out. With the case fans and LEDs being powered, as well as the PSU fan spinning just fine, **I would rule out issues related to the PSU** (it's also a quality 80+Gold PSU). Some will say it's a low wattage PSU, but my system being estimated at around a 350 wattage, I believe 550W should be enough. Again correct me if I'm wrong. In any case, without GPU plugged in, power output should not be an issue.\n\nI also tried plugging the CPU cooler into the case fans system, and it spun perfectly fine: **I would rule out faulty CPU cooler** (it not being detected would likely prevent the CPU from being powered on).",

    "selftext": "Hi, I’m looking to upgrade my setup from just a steam deck LCD and am wondering whether I would be able to build a pc on this budget that is more powerful than the legion go or if I should purchase the legion instead?\n\nAs I said, I’ve only ever owned a basic laptop and a steam deck. The next step for me is either the Legion Go or a PC. \n\nNone of the games I play are particularly demanding, except planet zoo and the sims. I’m looking for something that would be able to run these at a solid 60fps with mods. Most of the games I play are indie titles or less demanding (Rimworld, Stardew, powerwash sim, unpacking, two point etc) so it doesn’t need to be top range. \n\nIf anyone has any advice, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks :)",

When I went to adjust it I think I bumped a fan header near the bottom of the board. Something clicked and all my fans instantly started spinning faster. I got an error code when booting, for my CPU fan. I tried the troubleshooting recommendations but this didn't fix the error so I set the CPU fan settings to ignore. That let me boot the computer but the fans all seem to be stuck at one speed and are not showing up in the bios. Configuring the fans doesn't seem to change anything. Am I cooked? Any chance me bumping something could've somehow made all the fan headers malfunction?  ",

I currently have a 9060 xt in my pc but i plan on upgrading so i will be giving it to him. I used pcpartpicker to make this build and I just wanted to ask the reddit group if it was a good build before I go all in on it. Mainly I need to know if it will be good for being built around the 9060xt and he will be running it on 1080p so it shouldn’t be demanding too much from the gpu. If anyone has any suggestions or comments on the parts selected or if I should switch them out, I would really appreciate it. I would like the budget (excluding the gpu because I already have it) to be under $650. I am also located in America and about an hour and a half away from a micro center.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I'm Hrvoje the CEO & Founder of Ironward - a small, independent studio from Croatia building strategy games.\n\nBack in high school, I was part of a team that started building an RTS-hybrid where players battle for world domination and ascend to godhood. The idea of me creating video games and impacting other people's lives the way games impacted mine bought me over instantly and I knew then and there that this would be my lifelong call. I wanted to make other people feel the joy and happiness that I felt playing my favorite games, and this game - early Atre - seemed like a perfect medium for that.\n\nBut, it was early 2000s, game development wasn't as huge as it is today, and we were young and new.\n\n\n\nTeam disbanded.\n\nLife moved on.\n\nI continued chasing my dream of developing games and founded Ironward. We released a few titles, all inspired by that original feeling that I felt when working on Atre in my highschool days. The games performed well, people supported us on our first Kickstarter campaign, and I was happy with how we were growing as a studio, but the game that ignited all of this was gathering dust somewhere, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that we have to find it and do something with it.\n\nDecades later, a dedicated fan who received the project from the initial developers reached out to me and, after confirming that I was indeed one of the guys working on the project back in the day, sent the original files of Atre. I couldn't believe it at first because I was absolutely convinced Atre was lost - after all, why would anyone spend time and effort maintaining an unfinished game for all these years? But it seems like he saw the same value and potential that I saw. \n\nI decided to bring it back to life - rebuilt the game from scratch on modern tech, with that same “massive magical battlefield” feel to it.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, 25 years later, and after years of reworking and adapting the project to meet today's standards, it’s finally alive and almost finished. We launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the last phase of the project. Our goal is to raise enough to be able to comfortably finish Atre and add all the polishing and content that we believe would enhance the game and establish it as a go-to title for anyone who loves high-fantasy strategy games.\n\nWe also have an active playtest running for which anyone can apply, and we are actively monitoring and listening to all player feedback because we want to build this game together with the community.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\- Hrvoje\n\n(Kickstarter link’s in the comments - trying to keep this post clean.)",

Its a psychological horror puzzle game where you monitor camera feeds across different levels to repair unstable realities, You report these \"Fractures\" distortions in time, space and logic each one risking the multiverse itself. Like I said in the title my game is heavily inspired by games like I'm on observation duty and the like.\n\nThis is my first published game, So the learning curve was insane, I learned a lot while making the game, Hopefully anyone that plays it has fun and enjoys it, I also plan on updating the game as much as possible like balancing, optimization, more fractures, more levels and much more.\n\nSteam Link: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3691780/Continuum\\_Keeper/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3691780/Continuum_Keeper/)",

    "selftext": "Recently I came across a video that compares game projects from different years in terms of immersion and the development of physical models. Very interesting comparison - I advise to watch the full video. And the point is that new titles are inferior to old games in almost everything except graphics, of course.\n\nIndeed, I remember how, back in the 2000s, my friends and I always looked first at the destructibility in FPS. The more objects on the map you could shoot, the more bullet marks you left on the walls, and the more parts you could dismember your enemies into - the better the game was. Photorealistic graphics faded into the background. And when Half-Life 2 released, where you could also drag and drop various objects around, our excitement knew no bounds.\n\nAnd the more I look at my Steam library, the more I see that photorealistic graphics don't help if the surrounding world, no matter how beautiful, doesn't react to the player.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way, and it's time for me to upgrade, or there's something really wrong with game development lately? What do you think?",

People can literally hack your PC and install malware if you just sit in the menu's on the older CODs. MW2019 uses a different engine and dedicated servers and there hasn't been any reports of RCE exploits on that COD or newer CODs. So it got me curious, if P2P CODs have RCE exploits, do older games that use P2P also have RCE exploits and are unsafe to play? ",

Think *Assemble With Care* meets *Trash Goblin* \\- but with resistors, LEDs, and a tiny hamster helping you fix things.\n\n[Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3587450/Crispy_Circuits/)\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-YcvKScI9Y)\n\nYou play as **Giddily**, an 11-year-old prodigy who helps neighbours repair gadgets while secretly working on her big project: restoring her hamster’s RC plane. Each puzzle is based on real electrical problems - like building a charger from scratch or regulating voltage... It's all powered by an actual [SPICE simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE), so circuits behave the way they would in real life.\n\nWe’re trying to make electronics *feel approachable and creative*, instead of intimidating. You can mess around, short-circuit things (safely!), and learn by doing.\n\nIt’s equal parts **STEM sandbox** and **cozy story game** \\- we are thinking of adding in lo-fi beats and already have pastel visuals, and a hamster named Crispy who occasionally powers your circuits with his wheel.\n\nWe’d love to hear what the PC gaming crowd thinks:\n\n* Do educational-but-cozy games like this appeal to you?\n* Would you rather see more structured challenges, or full sandbox freedom to experiment?\n\nAppreciate any feedback, especially from folks who would find themselves at the crossroads of:\n\n* Assemble With Care\n* Trash Goblin\n* Spirit City: Lofi Sessions\n* PC Building Simulator\n* Little Rocket Lab",

Rather than let it die, I'm making it open source in hopes that someone in the community will pick it up and continue development.\n\n**Looking for Maintainers:**\nI'm specifically looking for someone who wants to seriously take on the project and manage the public repository. If you're interested or want to discuss, join the Fuzion Discord - link to Discord in the repo readme.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/stomane/fuzion\n\nFeel free to fork it, fix it, improve it, or use it as a learning resource. The code is all yours now!\n\nThanks to everyone who used Fuzion over the years. Here's hoping it gets a second life in the hands of the community! 🙏",

    "title": "Why do so many people dislike the Epic Games Launcher’s UI? Am I missing something?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, hope you’re all doing good.\n\nSo I saw a post earlier where someone was asking whether to buy *Arc Raiders* on Epic or Steam. They ended up going with Steam, which is fair, but it reminded me how every time this topic comes up people go *“Steam’s better. Epic’s UI sucks.”*\n\nAnd I’m just curious, what *exactly* is it that people dislike so much about Epic’s UI?\n\nI use both pretty evenly, and honestly, they feel about the same to me. Most of what I do is:\n\n* Buy games\n* Read game pages / watch trailers\n* Launch games\n\nFor those things, both launchers get the job done. Epic even loads faster on my PC, Steam always does its little update check on startup, which takes a bit.\n\nWhen it comes to the library, I actually kinda prefer Epic’s layout. The quick launch tab and filters (like “installed only” or “recently added”) are super handy. Steam’s library always feels a bit cluttered unless I manually organize everything.\n\nThat said, Steam definitely wins once you click on a specific game, the playtime, achievements, screenshots, reviews, all that. Epic mostly just shows the title unless you go to the store page.\n\nStill, in day-to-day use, I just click *Play* or *Launch* and that’s it. Steam has Big Picture Mode and better controller input stuff, sure, but I don’t really use overlays or custom mappings anyway since my Xbox controller works fine in most games.\n\nSo yeah, for people who *really* dislike Epic’s launcher:  \n\\-What is it specifically that bothers you?  \n\\-Is it missing features like achievements/workshop/etc.?  \n\\-Or do you just find the design itself clunky or ugly?\n\nNot talking about the “I want all my games in one place” thing, that’s fair. I mean purely when people say Epic’s *UI/UX* is bad. What about it makes it bad to you?\n\n**TL;DR:** I use both Steam and Epic about the same and don’t see a big difference. What about Epic’s *UI* makes people dislike it so much?",

The new game is also completely broken and not playable \n\nIt feels like every new game that comes out is so broken and incomplete. I am hopeful that this will give some room and demand for a developer to make something really special that will have little to no competition \n\n",

You build a system to terraform it with an army of drones.   \n  \nIt's an automation game where the location of your factories matters in the world. The world is divided into different regions with their own microclimates, experiencing varying types of hazardous weather as the world gets terraformed. You will design an automated defense system to protect your factories from storms. The world is handcrafted and designed to be fully utilized. As you terraform and progress, you'll expand the safely accessible area.   \n  \nI'm also a weather nerd - always envisioned a game with dynamic weather that also becomes an important part of the game. You set up a weather monitoring system, forecast weather, and prepare for storms. Storms have a physical presence in the world; you can fly in and out of a storm!\n\nWishlist on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/)\n\nDiscord community: [https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m](https://discord.gg/aDHjwKts4m)\n\nThank you very much for the support!",

Yet all we hear is company XYZ cutting corners, firing staff, poor optimizations, $90 price tag etc. while somehow these companies are also still not making enough money?  \n  \nFor example, how was Infinity Ward/Activision able to make one of the greatest COD games MW2 in 16 months and run on a PS3 with 256mb ram near flawlessly, but I can’t even run Warzone smoothly on low settings on my fucking RTX5070 with 32gb RAM, and they’ve been actively developing/patching that garbage for like 5-7 years? Not to mention the fact they’ve milked revenue from that game the whole time through skins while MW2 was being patched for free.     \n  \n  \nIt sounds stupid, but did these companies forget about saving money by hiring talented people who can manage projects and create quality products within reasonable constraints, who understand limitations and can be creative to work around them? Why are studios hiring people who create garbage then spend a year(s) post production patching the game to make it playable? In the construction industry there’s a saying we use along the lines of, “If you have time to come back and fix it, you had time to do it right the first time.”. \n  \nBit of a rant but also a general curiosity on how this industry has completely evolved to something that doesn’t seem to understand what they’ve got their hands on. This seems like the best time to make unbelievable money and create amazing quality games and it just isn’t happening for some of these big names.\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I've played games all my life. Something I notice is that I only rage when I play comp pvp games (league, rivals, clash royale, etc). I never rage in single player games. I think gaming rage comes from a lack of control. \n\nYou can control how YOU play. Your micro, macro, game sense, hero selection, strategy, mindset, etc.\n\nYou can't control what kinds of teammates you get queued up with, how they play, or the reliability of your internet/system. Notice how a lot of competitive games are labeled as \"toxic\"? Its because people are always blaming others.\n\nI can't think of a single time where I hard raged in a single player game. Why? Because I know that my perfomance is directly related the only variable; me. \n\nSorry for the yap. Was pooping on the toliet and just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I'm Hrvoje the CEO & Founder of Ironward - a small, independent studio from Croatia building strategy games.\n\nBack in high school, I was part of a team that started building an RTS-hybrid where players battle for world domination and ascend to godhood. The idea of me creating video games and impacting other people's lives the way games impacted mine bought me over instantly and I knew then and there that this would be my lifelong call. I wanted to make other people feel the joy and happiness that I felt playing my favorite games, and this game - early Atre - seemed like a perfect medium for that.\n\nBut, it was early 2000s, game development wasn't as huge as it is today, and we were young and new.\n\n\n\nTeam disbanded.\n\nLife moved on.\n\nI continued chasing my dream of developing games and founded Ironward. We released a few titles, all inspired by that original feeling that I felt when working on Atre in my highschool days. The games performed well, people supported us on our first Kickstarter campaign, and I was happy with how we were growing as a studio, but the game that ignited all of this was gathering dust somewhere, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that we have to find it and do something with it.\n\nDecades later, a dedicated fan who received the project from the initial developers reached out to me and, after confirming that I was indeed one of the guys working on the project back in the day, sent the original files of Atre. I couldn't believe it at first because I was absolutely convinced Atre was lost - after all, why would anyone spend time and effort maintaining an unfinished game for all these years? But it seems like he saw the same value and potential that I saw. \n\nI decided to bring it back to life - rebuilt the game from scratch on modern tech, with that same “massive magical battlefield” feel to it.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, 25 years later, and after years of reworking and adapting the project to meet today's standards, it’s finally alive and almost finished. We launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the last phase of the project. Our goal is to raise enough to be able to comfortably finish Atre and add all the polishing and content that we believe would enhance the game and establish it as a go-to title for anyone who loves high-fantasy strategy games.\n\nWe also have an active playtest running for which anyone can apply, and we are actively monitoring and listening to all player feedback because we want to build this game together with the community.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\- Hrvoje\n\n(Kickstarter link’s in the comments - trying to keep this post clean.)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I'm Hrvoje the CEO & Founder of Ironward - a small, independent studio from Croatia building strategy games.\n\nBack in high school, I was part of a team that started building an RTS-hybrid where players battle for world domination and ascend to godhood. The idea of me creating video games and impacting other people's lives the way games impacted mine bought me over instantly and I knew then and there that this would be my lifelong call. I wanted to make other people feel the joy and happiness that I felt playing my favorite games, and this game - early Atre - seemed like a perfect medium for that.\n\nBut, it was early 2000s, game development wasn't as huge as it is today, and we were young and new.\n\n\n\nTeam disbanded.\n\nLife moved on.\n\nI continued chasing my dream of developing games and founded Ironward. We released a few titles, all inspired by that original feeling that I felt when working on Atre in my highschool days. The games performed well, people supported us on our first Kickstarter campaign, and I was happy with how we were growing as a studio, but the game that ignited all of this was gathering dust somewhere, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that we have to find it and do something with it.\n\nDecades later, a dedicated fan who received the project from the initial developers reached out to me and, after confirming that I was indeed one of the guys working on the project back in the day, sent the original files of Atre. I couldn't believe it at first because I was absolutely convinced Atre was lost - after all, why would anyone spend time and effort maintaining an unfinished game for all these years? But it seems like he saw the same value and potential that I saw. \n\nI decided to bring it back to life - rebuilt the game from scratch on modern tech, with that same “massive magical battlefield” feel to it.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, 25 years later, and after years of reworking and adapting the project to meet today's standards, it’s finally alive and almost finished. We launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the last phase of the project. Our goal is to raise enough to be able to comfortably finish Atre and add all the polishing and content that we believe would enhance the game and establish it as a go-to title for anyone who loves high-fantasy strategy games.\n\nWe also have an active playtest running for which anyone can apply, and we are actively monitoring and listening to all player feedback because we want to build this game together with the community.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\- Hrvoje\n\n(Kickstarter link’s in the comments - trying to keep this post clean.)",

Mostly will be used for academic work and internet browsing. \n\nAny recommendations that others have used and think highly of? Appreciate any help in advance. ",

The higher end models starting with the 850W version at 62.99 include ATX 3.1 and PCIe 5.1 support which makes them compatible with the newest NVIDIA cards.\n\nThe only drawbacks are the lack of an 80 PLUS efficiency rating and the fact that it is a brand new series with no user reviews yet, so its long term reliability is still uncertain. It could prove to be completely dependable or even one of the best budget PSU lines of the year, but for now it remains a bit of a gamble.

    "selftext": "I thought, “Hey, it’s been years, let’s relive the old Fortnite days.”\nSo I downloaded the Epic Games Launcher — huge mistake already.\n\nFirst, their downloader is unbelievably slow.\nLike, how is this a multi-billion-dollar company, yet their launcher downloads slower than a toaster running Windows XP?\n\nAfter 11 hours, I was finally at around 70 GB of 80-something.\nThen it freezes.\nI pause. Unpause. Nothing.\nI restart my PC and relaunch Epic… and it tells me to redownload 77 GB from scratch.\n\nWhy even have a “resume download” feature if your launcher just forgets everything?\nWhat’s the point of this fancy read/write system when one hiccup wipes your entire install?\nSteam, Battle.net, even Origin can recover partial downloads — but not Epic.\n\nI even tried all the “fixes” people mention:\n*Deleting manifest files\n*Renaming folders\n*Starting a new download and merging my old 70 GB data\n *Clicking verify\n\nGuess what? Still starts from 0%.\nEpic literally cannot detect 70 GB of already-downloaded files sitting right there.\n\nSo now I have to redownload 80 GB again — on a launcher that crawls slower than a snail with arthritis.\n\nAll I wanted was to play for nostalgia.\nInstead, I got 12 hours of wasted time, corrupted files, and a reminder why no one wants to deal with Epic’s garbage launcher anymore.\n\nA dead launcher for a dead game.\nWho’s gonna bother downloading a 90 GB “free” game when the launcher feels like it was coded in MS Paint?\n",

I work from home full time so find the ultrawide great for work and when games are compatible it can be great. But there's a few too many times now where games I want to play haven't been compatible with ultrawide, or where it does, the developer hasn't considered the user experience.  The HUD is often in your peripheral vision given how wide the monitor is. In games like WoW where you can move the HUD around it's not a problem, but for games where they've just stretched the screen and called it a day, not so much.\n\nThe work around you can do through Flawless Widescreen to add Ultrawide support to games is not a good experience. Every game patch breaks it, leaving you waiting for the mod to update if at all. Or such as in the case of Elden Ring, also had to play offline and modify the game files, I've not been able to get ultrawide working with it for months. And some games will detect it as cheating. And many games just aren't supported through the mod.\n\nSo I decided to have best of both. If a game supports Ultrawide I'll use the Alienware, if not I can use the MSI. I have a standing desk and it's Vesa mounted so easy enough to bring it eye level. I also treadmill at my desk sometimes so having the monitor stacked is great for watching videos.",

    "selftext": "Hey again after solving what killed my pc a couple months ago (cpu kicked and a ram stick as well, both got resolved) I'm looking to upgrade away from the 14th gen as a whole and to also give my pc a bit of a refresh as well. I picked up a asus ROG g16 with a ryzen 9hx3d and a 5070 ti for college as I live on campus(it died as well and is currently being shipped to asus for repairs) And besides the aforementioned issue it's been stellar at running games with the 5070 ti. But that makes me 2-0 when it comes to amd processors kicking the bucket on me so I'm dead set on sticking with team blue.\n\nFor context my current rigs specs are\n\n**CPU**: Intel 14700k (new processor from intel from the warranty claim)\n\n**GPU** Gigabyte Rtx 4070\n\n**Ram** G Skill ripjaws 4x16 (64 gb total)\n\n**case** fractal north atx tower\n\n**cpu cooler**: Lian Li Galahad 240 mm radiator (dual 120mm fans) and an extra 120 mm fan for exhaust. (used fractal fans for intake in front the rad is mounted on top)\n\n**PSU:** MSI mag 850 80 plus gold.\n\n**SSD:** Samsung 980 Pro 2tb nvme ssd\n\nIm looking to reuse as many parts as possible mainly the SSD, radiator, case fans and possibly the PSU\n\nWhat I'm looking to get is a new motherboard (wifi 6e or 7 capable and has multiple ssd slots) and at least a core ultra 7 or core ultra 9. (micro center has really good deals on combos) and a new gpu. I was thinking 5070 ti or if I can find a killer deal maybe swing for a 5080 (ik I probably would need a psu as well) and add one or 2 new ssd's to increase storage. Any help would be stellar with trying to spec this out as Im torn between the 2 cards.",

    "selftext": "2 months ago, I bought a prebuilt PC off of Amazon for a little under £800 (£780 or $1050). I thought they can't be that bad. And... they aren't. It's not a beast by any means, and I play on a 1440p 34\" Ultrawide, so its performance is naturally not going through the roof. I play a lot of sim racing titles with a lot of software running in the background, and it is very stable. After buying it, I checked to see if it was anywhere near the same price if I bought all the parts myself. Without an official Windows 11 Key, a case, and a wifi adapter that they gave me, I paid £17 ($22) less. The specs aren't the worst either, but they've pretty much done no future proofing or viable upgrade path.\n\n  \nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 8400F\n\nGPU: MSI RTX 5060 8GB Ventus 2X OC\n\nRAM: 2x Kingston Fury DDR5 8GB 5600MHz CL40\n\nPSU: CIT FX Pro 600W 80 Plus Bronze\n\nSSD: KLEVV C715 1TB M.2 NVMe Gen 3\n\nMotherboard: MSI Pro A620M-E mATX\n\n  \nMy gripes with the PC is the CPU & Motherboard only go up to PCIe Gen 4 with the CPU only running x8, PBO is non-existant, PSU is non-modular, and the case it came in had the worst airflow known to man (The front of the case blocked the fans from intaking air. Fast forward to now, the PC holds up well, and in most games, I can at least hit 90 FPS without the frame gen crap at medium to max settings depending on the title, which is half my 180Hz display refresh rate. Of course, I've given it some upgrades, with more coming soon hopefully before the end of the year.\n\n\n\nBought:\n\nCase: IONZ KZ-900 mATX case - £50 ($65)\n\nAIO: Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 240 - £70 ($92)\n\nFans: 3x Arctic P12 Pro PWM 120mm (2x Reverse) - £35 ($46)\n\n\n\nPlanned:\n\nGPU: MSI RTX 5070 12GB Shadow 2X OC - £480 ($630)\n\nSSD: Crucial P310 2TB M.2 NVMe Gen 4 - £105 ($138)\n\nRAM: 2x Crucial Pro DDR5 16GB 6000MHz CL36 - £140 ($184)\n\nPSU: MSI MAG A750GL 750W 80 Plus Gold - £85 ($112)\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte B850M Gaming X mATX - £175 ($230)\n\n\n\nIf you're wondering why I've chose to buy it and spend even more money to upgrade it is because parts weren't in stock when I ordered this PC. So at least this way, I have a PC I can use and just upgrade it as I go along. I have a decent income, so buying a couple of parts each month won't hurt me with all my other outgoings.\n\nIt was probably a dumb idea, but we move. Let me know how much of an idiot I am.",

I decided I want to turn it into a dedicated steam machine so I want to install bazzite. Given it's an LGA 1155, i7 3770, 16gb of ram. It runs better with an AMD GPU, so I want to replace my 1070ti. What will be a great replacement? I understand bottlenecking, and as my finances improve over time I hope to upgrade the MB, CPU, AND RAM. So I plan to sell or trade my card locally for an AMD. ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently bought a new GPU about a month or two ago, and I’m concerned about a burnt connector on my PC. I tested it today, and it still turns on and works, but when I try to load games like Battlefield Six, my screen goes black, and I have to reboot my PC for it to work again. The GPU still turns on and works, but the connector is burnt. I’m not sure what to do. Is the GPU still safe? Should I get a new cable, or is my GPU damaged?\n\nThe card turns on and works, but when I play games or surf the web, the screen randomly goes black while the PC is still on, and then I have to hard shut it down.\n\nThis GPU was never modified or overclocked. I always played with an undervolt set for the GPU, and it never exceeded the 600W limit of the wire. Only plaid games like Battlefield 6, Cyberpunk 2077, Outerworlds, Minecraft, etc.\n\n**Edit #1**: For the people asking me why I bought the 12V 9070 XT, it was because I got it as a gift from a friend. I was going to buy a 5070 Ti w/o the 12V connector, but I got the Nitro+ for free, so I used it. I contacted Sapphire for RMA, and they are currently asking for the purchase receipt and working it out. I will update it once I hear back with more info\n\n**Edit #2**: Found out that my case is the third reported case ever of the Nitro+ connector burning",

She powered every block in Minecraft and, in her final year, gracefully became my entertainment center. Still glowing. Still faithful.\n\nLast night, her lights came on, but no display.

    "selftext": "2 months ago, I bought a prebuilt PC off of Amazon for a little under £800 (£780 or $1050). I thought they can't be that bad. And... they aren't. It's not a beast by any means, and I play on a 1440p 34\" Ultrawide, so its performance is naturally not going through the roof. I play a lot of sim racing titles with a lot of software running in the background, and it is very stable. After buying it, I checked to see if it was anywhere near the same price if I bought all the parts myself. Without an official Windows 11 Key, a case, and a wifi adapter that they gave me, I paid £17 ($22) less. The specs aren't the worst either, but they've pretty much done no future proofing or viable upgrade path.\n\n  \nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 8400F\n\nGPU: MSI RTX 5060 8GB Ventus 2X OC\n\nRAM: 2x Kingston Fury DDR5 8GB 5600MHz CL40\n\nPSU: CIT FX Pro 600W 80 Plus Bronze\n\nSSD: KLEVV C715 1TB M.2 NVMe Gen 3\n\nMotherboard: MSI Pro A620M-E mATX\n\n  \nMy gripes with the PC is the CPU & Motherboard only go up to PCIe Gen 4 with the CPU only running x8, PBO is non-existant, PSU is non-modular, and the case it came in had the worst airflow known to man (The front of the case blocked the fans from intaking air. Fast forward to now, the PC holds up well, and in most games, I can at least hit 90 FPS without the frame gen crap at medium to max settings depending on the title, which is half my 180Hz display refresh rate. Of course, I've given it some upgrades, with more coming soon hopefully before the end of the year.\n\n\n\nBought:\n\nCase: IONZ KZ-900 mATX case - £50 ($65)\n\nAIO: Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 240 - £70 ($92)\n\nFans: 3x Arctic P12 Pro PWM 120mm (2x Reverse) - £35 ($46)\n\n\n\nPlanned:\n\nGPU: MSI RTX 5070 12GB Shadow 2X OC - £480 ($630)\n\nSSD: Crucial P310 2TB M.2 NVMe Gen 4 - £105 ($138)\n\nRAM: 2x Crucial Pro DDR5 16GB 6000MHz CL36 - £140 ($184)\n\nPSU: MSI MAG A750GL 750W 80 Plus Gold - £85 ($112)\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte B850M Gaming X mATX - £175 ($230)\n\n\n\nIf you're wondering why I've chose to buy it and spend even more money to upgrade it is because parts weren't in stock when I ordered this PC. So at least this way, I have a PC I can use and just upgrade it as I go along. I have a decent income, so buying a couple of parts each month won't hurt me with all my other outgoings.\n\nIt was probably a dumb idea, but we move. Let me know how much of an idiot I am.",

I work from home full time so find the ultrawide great for work and when games are compatible it can be great. But there's a few too many times now where games I want to play haven't been compatible with ultrawide, or where it does, the developer hasn't considered the user experience.  The HUD is often in your peripheral vision given how wide the monitor is. In games like WoW where you can move the HUD around it's not a problem, but for games where they've just stretched the screen and called it a day, not so much.\n\nThe work around you can do through Flawless Widescreen to add Ultrawide support to games is not a good experience. Every game patch breaks it, leaving you waiting for the mod to update if at all. Or such as in the case of Elden Ring, also had to play offline and modify the game files, I've not been able to get ultrawide working with it for months. And some games will detect it as cheating. And many games just aren't supported through the mod.\n\nSo I decided to have best of both. If a game supports Ultrawide I'll use the Alienware, if not I can use the MSI. I have a standing desk and it's Vesa mounted so easy enough to bring it eye level. I also treadmill at my desk sometimes so having the monitor stacked is great for watching videos.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently bought a new GPU about a month or two ago, and I’m concerned about a burnt connector on my PC. I tested it today, and it still turns on and works, but when I try to load games like Battlefield Six, my screen goes black, and I have to reboot my PC for it to work again. The GPU still turns on and works, but the connector is burnt. I’m not sure what to do. Is the GPU still safe? Should I get a new cable, or is my GPU damaged?\n\nThe card turns on and works, but when I play games or surf the web, the screen randomly goes black while the PC is still on, and then I have to hard shut it down.\n\nThis GPU was never modified or overclocked. I always played with an undervolt set for the GPU, and it never exceeded the 600W limit of the wire. Only plaid games like Battlefield 6, Cyberpunk 2077, Outerworlds, Minecraft, etc.\n\n**Edit #1**: For the people asking me why I bought the 12V 9070 XT, it was because I got it as a gift from a friend. I was going to buy a 5070 Ti w/o the 12V connector, but I got the Nitro+ for free, so I used it. I contacted Sapphire for RMA, and they are currently asking for the purchase receipt and working it out. I will update it once I hear back with more info\n\n**Edit #2**: Found out that my case is the third reported case ever of the Nitro+ connector burning",

My old NZXT H7 Flow has been solid for about 5 years, but I was just getting bored of it. Ended up grabbing the Hyte X50, and honestly, this might be the best case I’ve ever built in.\n\nIt looks sick (at least to me), cable management was stupid easy, and it somehow runs quieter than my old setup. Genuinely impressed.\n\nI’m still not loving how my AIO cables look though — if anyone has ideas on how to clean that up, please drop some advice. Not feeling it right now.\n\nAnyway, here’s the full setup:\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* GIGABYTE X870 AORUS ELITE\n* MSI Suprim RTX 5080 Liquid SOC\n* G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB (AMD EXPO) 32GB\n* 2× WD\\_BLACK 2TB SN850X\n* CORSAIR Nautilus 360RS AIO\n* Hyte X50 case\n* Lian Li Edge 1000W PSU\n* 7× Lian Li Infinity Fans\n* 3× Lian Li LCD Wireless Reverse Fans\n* 3× GPU fans (mounted opposite the GPU AIO)\n\nRoast away or hit me with tips , I can take it ",

    "selftext": "So after I posted my “dream PC” on pcmr, last week and some of you absolutely roasted it, I decided to tear it all down and move everything into a new case. My old NZXT H7 Flow has been solid for about 5 years, but I was just getting bored of it. Ended up grabbing the Hyte X50, and honestly, this might be the best case I’ve ever built in.\n\nIt looks sick (at least to me), cable management was stupid easy, and it somehow runs quieter than my old setup. Genuinely impressed.\n\nI’m still not loving how my AIO cables look though — if anyone has ideas on how to clean that up, please drop some advice. Not feeling it right now.\n\nAnyway, here’s the full setup:\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* GIGABYTE X870 AORUS ELITE\n* MSI Suprim RTX 5080 Liquid SOC\n* G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB (AMD EXPO) 32GB\n* 2× WD\\_BLACK 2TB SN850X\n* CORSAIR Nautilus 360RS AIO\n* Hyte X50 case\n* Lian Li Edge 1000W PSU\n* 7× Lian Li Infinity Fans\n* 3× Lian Li LCD Wireless Reverse Fans\n* 3× GPU fans (mounted opposite the GPU AIO)\n\nRoast away or hit me with tips , I can take it ",

I'm happy with the final result.\n\nHad to do some drilling and tinkering to get the speaker stands to fit where I wanted. Redrilled plates, longer bolts, drilled riser, had to redo all my cable management. Not sure why I like doing it but I do.

    "selftext": "So after I posted my “dream PC” on pcmr, last week and some of you absolutely roasted it, I decided to tear it all down and move everything into a new case. My old NZXT H7 Flow has been solid for about 5 years, but I was just getting bored of it. Ended up grabbing the Hyte X50, and honestly, this might be the best case I’ve ever built in.\n\nIt looks sick (at least to me), cable management was stupid easy, and it somehow runs quieter than my old setup. Genuinely impressed.\n\nI’m still not loving how my AIO cables look though — if anyone has ideas on how to clean that up, please drop some advice. Not feeling it right now.\n\nAnyway, here’s the full setup:\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n* GIGABYTE X870 AORUS ELITE\n* MSI Suprim RTX 5080 Liquid SOC\n* G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB (AMD EXPO) 32GB\n* 2× WD\\_BLACK 2TB SN850X\n* CORSAIR Nautilus 360RS AIO\n* Hyte X50 case\n* Lian Li Edge 1000W PSU\n* 7× Lian Li Infinity Fans\n* 3× Lian Li LCD Wireless Reverse Fans\n* 3× GPU fans (mounted opposite the GPU AIO)\n\nRoast away or hit me with tips , I can take it ",

Who knew there are so few that are actually nice on the eye and none that don't require their own desk to sit on. I finally settled on some from Amazon with a clean enough look that I thought I would be able to work with. I'm happy with the final result.\n\nHad to do some drilling and tinkering to get the speaker stands to fit where I wanted. Redrilled plates, longer bolts, drilled riser, had to redo all my cable management. Not sure why I like doing it but I do. Anything else around the house is a chore, but this is therapy. \n\nLet me know what you think, and what I could do next?...... I enjoy my therapy sessions.",

I’m really happy to be back, and to finally share what I’ve been working on.\n\nThis release introduces Lolito, a variant of Lola, inspired by the eerie spirals of Junji Ito’s Uzumaki. It’s a piece that’s been evolving in my head for a long time, and I’m excited to finally bring it to life.\n\nI’ve made a small batch of caps now available through a raffle sale, including other sculpts, which is currently live.\n\nIt feels good to return and reconnect with this community again. Thanks for taking a look.\n\nCheers,\nRachel \n\n(Disclosure: I am the maker and seller of these keycaps under Wildstory.)",

Hence the design for this one was born. \n\nThe shape is loosely a Microsoft Sculpt. The keys aside from my pinky are a stiffer spring, with browns for the pinkies. And even firmer ones for the mod keys, space bar etc. \n\nStarted out as a scrap 2x6, slowly took this shape. The switches are glued in, and the back is hand wired again. It turns out that scrap hdmi cables have great fine wire. \n\nThe keycap design was gonna be epoxy resin cast, then clay coated with something durable, then possibly coins. And finally landing on flattened, shaped and polished copper pipe. \n\nMy hope is the patina will start to show a typing pattern, as I use it. \n\n\nAnd if you’re doing math, covid was a while back. The design was completed in 2020, I just got back to it to finish this week. ",

    "title": "thoughts and reviews of some light tactile switches",
    "selftext": "hey yall!\n\nfirst time posting in literal years! i wanted to share thoughts about the slew of light tactile switches that have come onto the market this year. there have, of course, been light tactile switch offerings in the past, but i didn't buy those, so i won't be talking about them lol\n\nfor some context, i've always enjoyed mx browns and pretty much use that as the base for all light tactile switches to compare against. i also have been using pewter switches, gateron cap browns, mode signals, and ttc gold v2s (lol they're somehow bad but good to me idk) as some of the other light tactile switches i rotate through (for better or for worse). on top of that, i enjoy the 45g topre boards (hhkb2, fc660c, rf tkl, and cm novatouch (rip)). so even though these aren't all the light tactile switches i have experience in, for the sake of this post, they are my points of reference.  \n\n'light tactile' is also a hard to pin kind of description because it can mean certain things to different people. so for the purposes of this post, when i say light tactile, what i mean specifically is that a) the bottom out weight is typically in the 50-60g range AND b) the tactile bump is small, a 'p' or 'b' shaped bump depending on when and where the tactility starts. some people only refer to one or the other, so this is what i'm basing my thoughts on. \n\nthe switches i'll be writing about will have quick and dirty typing videos taken with an iphone 15 (and posted on imgur) so this is a big ass disclaimer that they haven't been recorded for any scientific consistencies or best audio/environment considerations or to even compare the switches to each other, specifically. they're just snapshots of how they sound inside the boards i've installed them in so ymmv. they may wildly differ in sound and feel to you on your boards. so just fyi, please and thanks.\n\nalso, i paid with all of these with my own money and am just a hobbyist returning to the community with thoughts on new switches that's making keebs fun again for me.\n\nhmx bleeds and bruises\n\n>these are basically twins with nary a difference between them save for .3mm of travel, at least according to milktooth's website. they are fun to type on. they're light and they sound bright and clacky. they're my first foray into using hmx switches (since up to this point they've only had linears) and i think that they are great intros to both hmx and/or to light tactile switches. they're lighter in weight than mx browns but they don't suffer for it. they are enjoyable to get into a long typing session (and fast too! the bruises i type in jumped to 160wpm for the 30sec typing test without even meaning to!). i pretty much immediately put them onto boards as soon as i got them and they have yet to disappoint. i co-sign a lot of the reviews these have gotten and i think deserve a bit of their hype. i enjoy how gentle the tactile bump is because i typically like to feel just enough friction when i'm typing but without how typo-prone i get with linears, even after i've gotten used to the board. overall, solid sets of switches and i recommend them for their feel, sound, and price point. at time of writing, on milktooth's site, they're both $0.42/each, so $4.20 for 10pcs. i find this price reasonable. the naming and color scheme are also quite clever so i would def give them points for that.\n\n>[hmx bleeds typing sounds on neo ergo](https://imgur.com/XGOIh6z) (aluminum case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\n>[hmx bruises typing sounds on mode 2022 sonnet](https://imgur.com/XyaAFlJ) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, top mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nhmx k01 \n\n>these and the akko bittersweets are the closest to mx browns by feel out of all the switches on this lineup and for that i quite enjoy them. they're a good pick for those who want a 'better' and 'more refined' version of an mx brown (no mods required, smooth, no scratchiness, etc -- even tho tbf, cherry has upped their game in their mx2a or hyperglides). i like the characteristics of mx browns but for those who might not want the effort involved in 'improving' on them, k01s are nice out of the box. the sound is clackier than mx browns to me, unsurprising of hmx's signature sound profile. at time of writing, on milktooth's website, they go for $0.35/each which is a pretty good value overall, definitely cheaper than bleeds and bruises or mx browns ($0.40/each on milktooth, but you may have better luck elsewhere. omnitype for example has them for $0.35/each but they come in packages of 35pcs instead of 10pcs). \n\n>[hmx k01 typing sounds on mode tempo](https://imgur.com/6rEOJY0) (aluminum case, copper plate, copper weight, gasket mount, no foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)\n\nakko bittersweets\n\n>i was most fascinated with these because of a few things. they are a departure in sound from hmx, promising a subtler and thockier sound profile. according to akko's website, not only are they the tactile counterpart to akko rosewoods (thocky linears), they also describe its name based on the sound and feel that someone might feel about them: \"[This bump is light that it might sometimes go unnoticed, producing a “bittersweet” mixed impression./The sound and feel might be “bitter” for some, yet “sweet” for others.](https://en.akkogear.com/product/bittersweet-switch-lubed/)\" which i thought was pretty neat as i'm sure there are people who would feel that way about them. they are comfortable and they are flatter in sound in the polygon-7 but in a pleasant way. overall, i'm getting good mileage out of them and would find them an easy rec for their value. i know there are akko cilantros that many people enjoy because of its stronger tactility and lighter weight, but i think bittersweets are more for me because of the smaller bump -- but disclaimer, i do not have akko cilantros and have never felt them. but based on reading comments, they feel like they're a gentler version of the cilantros. at time of writing, they're $15 for 45pcs or $0.33/each on amazon, which is what i paid. the akko website has 90pcs for $28 or $0.31/each. \n\n>[akko bittersweet typing sounds on daringrun polygon-7](https://imgur.com/2FVf4fh) (aluminum case, fr4 plate, gasket mount, plate foam, mda profile pbt keycaps)\n\ngateron mini i and gateron weightlessness\n\n>got these from the ikasaya closeout sale and i'd heard decent things about them so i thought i'd give them a try. the differences at least on the ikasaya website lists weightlessness as having a \"light to medium bump\" whereas mini i has a \"gentle tactile bump.\" i think if bleeds/bruises are twin sisters, then these are siblings close in age. the difference between them is that the weightlessness's tactile bump is a smidgen more pronounced and bounces back a bit more noticeably, for me, than the mini i. but that's when i'm taking the time to press down on them. for regular typing, the differences are negligible. overall, their typing experiences are quite pleasant and fall in line nicely with the rest of the switches i've mentioned here. at time of writing, from the ikasaya closeout sale, i got the gateron mini i for $37.50 for 90 switches, so about $0.42/each. in other places, they go for $0.60/each or $6 for 10pcs at milktooth and $10.80 for 18pcs at kineticlabs. as for the weightlessness, they were $40.10 for 90 switches, so about $0.45/each. on amazon, they go for $23.99 for 35pcs, so $0.69/each which is not as budget friendly as the other options here, though it does show a 10% coupon upon purchase. milktooth right now has a sale on them for $5.50 for 10pcs so $0.55/each. lumekeebs also offers the same $0.55/each. respectable price point at the discount, but i don't know if they're worth it above that.\n\n>[gateron mini i typing sounds on monsgeek mg75w](https://imgur.com/96YsEx6) (plastic case and plate, tray mount, all foam, cherry profile pbt keycaps)  \n[gateron weightlessness typing sounds on keychron v1 max](https://imgur.com/AqW3JB2) (plastic case, pc plate, gasket mount, all foam, osa profile pbt keycaps)\n\n[typing sounds playlist link](https://imgur.com/a/light-tactile-switches-typing-sounds-N1VjrJg) (imgur album)\n\nif i were to order them in light tactility in the context of mx browns as my center, then it goes as follows: hmx bleeds/bruises, akko bittersweets, mx browns, hmx k01, gateron mini i, gateron weightlessness. \n\nin sum, i'm quite satisfied with this cohort of light tactiles. these switches are great out of the box, need no modification, and are great switches for those who want to try them out as well as for those who already enjoy light tactiles. i feel good recommending them, but of course, your experiences and preferences are your own and up to your own curation and determination. i'm a happy typist with these switches and glad that the rest of my light tactile collection have good company. i look forward to rotating them with each other and on different boards than how they're configured at the moment but for now, i'm enjoying how each one feels on the boards i've chosen for them. \n\nfeel free to talk about your experiences or suggestions of other light tactiles you enjoy as well as ask questions or chat about these. thanks a bunch for reading! \n\n",

Was using the Glove80 up until I received the Imprint. While I found the Glove80 to be a great keyboard, there were just a few missing features that I wanted, like hot-swappable switches, MX switches, and the integrated trackballs.\n\nInstalled Durock Ice King switches and clear polycarbonate keycaps. Replaced the default black trackballs with Perixx PeriPro-303 purple and green trackballs. I was eyeing the sport balls trackballs from Perixx but they are very expensive.\n\nOrdered the Nylon + Aluminium material, with 5-rows and 5 full bottom row keys. Got the wider palm rest with Bamboo inserts. While the Imprint was made with XDA compatibility in mind, I found that they do fit the tallest Cherry profile keycaps. I am thinking of trying Full metal or ceramic keycaps in the future if they offer all 1u keys.\n\nSome other photos showing the build process. The last photo shows the weight mod I have done, adding an extra 200g of weight to each palm rest, bringing the weight of each palm rest to 270g. I have also did a tape mod and added Poron foam inside the case.",

    "selftext": "I bought a K6 non-pro about a week and a half ago to replace a Logitech membrane keyboards I was getting tired of. While I originally thought to keep it stock I thought I'd make it pop a little. I'm still using the stock keycaps ..and I tossed the gateron blues in it for browns pro v3, though I do have some milky yellow and green apples waiting for something.\n\nWhen I got the board my only intention was to just add the foam to the case, clip the stem feet on the stabs and do a tape mod. Oddly enough the feet on the stabs were already cut despite this being bought new so it saved me on that as it was decently lubed with no rattle or ticking on any stabilizer.\n\nI ended up painting the aluminum pieces. I used chalk paint ..and while it came out okay, it didn't adhere as well as I wanted to as corners had a harder time even after lightly sanding the bare pieces to grab the paint and finish but either way ..good enough cause I don't have a sprayer to have done it differently to get a more consistent finish. I stayed with the stock keycaps as I feel they contrast well with the muted green (pic doesn't do the color justice it's a little more muted like a matcha green color). Unfortunately, I'm skin allergic to pbt so I'm limited to ABS options ..I'm not particularly fond of the polycarbonate keycap sound.\n\nAt the time I was working on this I came across the weikav lucky65 v2 which in waiting to arrive soon. I ended up getting a barebones version along with a set of gmk double shot ABS nightshade clones. So this K6 might end up being shortlived on my desk and live more with my portable devices. I originally wanted to go with gazzew U4T with the lucky65, but unfortunately thanks to tariffs I'd rather wait it out and will instead be pairing it with either the milky yellow or the green apple switches.",

I even had the Apollo MT3 version back then, thinking I would build one for it soon. But eventually had to sell the keycaps for other reasons. \n\nFast forward to today, bought the ice blue Evoworks Evo75 and paired it with MiTo GMK Godspeed keycaps and deskmat. \n\nI haven't been keeping up with this hobby for a long time now but I can't believe pre-built keyboards are built this way nowadays. Simply amazing 👌\n\nThank you, Evoworks and for everyone who's keeping this hobby alive and going. From old timers to new timers, all love 💯\n\n",

However, that does come with some differences this year, primarily being *no alcohol or buying/selling goods.* Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the library's [code of conduct](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Customer_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) and [meeting room policy](https://www.columbuslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CP-Meeting_Rooms.pdf).\n\nI'm a big fan of the Dublin library and the area it's in - plenty of good food, drinks, and hotels for after the meetup.

Interchanged the switches and that made it better for maybe a couple days and then back to the faulty behavior. since i was out of warranty there is was nothing for me to do in that department.

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

Hence the design for this one was born. \n\nThe shape is loosely a Microsoft Sculpt. The keys aside from my pinky are a stiffer spring, with browns for the pinkies. And even firmer ones for the mod keys, space bar etc. \n\nStarted out as a scrap 2x6, slowly took this shape. The switches are glued in, and the back is hand wired again. It turns out that scrap hdmi cables have great fine wire. \n\nThe keycap design was gonna be epoxy resin cast, then clay coated with something durable, then possibly coins. And finally landing on flattened, shaped and polished copper pipe. \n\nMy hope is the patina will start to show a typing pattern, as I use it. \n\n\nAnd if you’re doing math, covid was a while back. The design was completed in 2020, I just got back to it to finish this week. ",

    "selftext": "Would you please help me choose an upgrade for my PC /Xbox/Work setup? I really need crystal clear text quality, as I work with spreadsheets and data entry a lot during the day. Then I game in the evenings (casual stuff like Balder's Gate 3 and Diablo 4). I really don't want a monitor with speakers, as I have decent enough speakers as is. I would be buying 2 or 3 to fill out my desk.\n\nBrief System Specs:\n\n* PC: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n* Monitors: (2) 2021 Asus VG278QR\n* Xbox Series X tied into 1 of the 3 monitors\n* Work: Dell Latitude 5450\n\nHere are the options I've been looking at:\n\n1. The Dell S2725QS at $240 stands out for its text clarity but seems like it's garbage for games. \n2. The Alienware AW2725DM $190 seems the reverse.\n3. The MSI G274QPF at $150 seems like a deal, but may be same boat as the Alienware: [MSI 27\" WQHD IPS Nvidia G-Sync Gaming Monitor | Costco](https://www.costco.com/p/-/msi-27-wqhd-ips-nvidia-g-sync-gaming-monitor-2560-x-1440/4000203457?storeId=10301&partNumber=4000203457&catalogId=10701&langId=-1&krypto=u2qFG%2F3%2BAzRPn3RyyId%2Byr1I3kSYiF6ddsFO5fZc8e1h6jA59FgxKYr%2FR1AieglXyy8Tx%2FBlDqBlelR%2FLY52bRdspGWI8DF0xXRoeurApAmmiQ0%2Bsyl3clyzLOp%2BgcEr)\n\nWhich would be the better option for long days of office work (Excel, PowerPoint, etc) and casual gaming on the side?",

I was looking into two options:\n\n1. An UltraWide monitor, 34\". I know PS doesn't support it, and it's going to be 16:9 with black pillars, and I don't care about that **as long as it supports 120Hz while in 16:9 on the Ultrawide.** Do you guys have any recommendations on this? Preferably ones that you are currently using or have used in the past.\n2. 2x 27\" Monitors, one premium that will be plugged into both the PS5 and Mac mini, and I will switch between Mac/Ps5 input when I need it, and another 27\" not-so-premium that will be connected just to the Mac Mini.\n\nThe problem here is that I don't want an Oled, since I will be working as well the burn-in will accelerate. The Recommendations I got on the internet, like Alienware AW2725Q or Asus PG32UCDM have some problems with PS5(as seen on reddit or other forums).\n\nI'd like to make the best out of the PS5 like: VRR, true HDMR, HDMi2.1, 4k 120hz, ALLM(this one ain't a hard requirement since Monitors have lower input lag than TVs).\n\nAnything that you could recommend here? My budget is about 800-900 euros for the 27\".\n\nAround 1000-1200 for 34\".\n\nThank you!",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, I recently bought an IPS monitor online, it turned out with no dead pixels and the least amount of backlight bleeding on an IPS panel, and as other people on reddit said I won the IPS panel lottery. But today I was trying to check its guarantee card, I checked its box and noticed that upside of the box was plump with duct tape but the underside of it wasn't and it was like somebody cut the duct tape plump and opened it and then put another duct tape on it after putting the monitor back in the box. Also the production date of the monitor is 2025/01 which is printed on its back.\nNow I know it turned out a very good monitor but the fact that somebody opened it before makes me think if it was bought by somebody else and returned it and then they sold it to me, it kinda bothers me and tells me to refund it, but on the other hand the panel is very good and as in another post when I asked about its backlight bleeding, others said I shouldn't refund it because its backlight bleeding is the least they ever saw and said if I refund it it would be something worse due to the fact that I bought a cheap 27 inch panel. So I came here to ask your opinion on it. \n\nThis is the post containing a picture of backlight bleeding of my monitor: https://www.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/1ohjssn/is_this_amount_of_backlight_bleed_enough_to/",

    "selftext": "After some years on an IPS monitor, I'm ready to make the move to OLED. But now I can't decide between 4K and 1440p. My doubt with 4K is that a 5070 ti/9600x combo won't be able to handle the highest graphics settings at 4K in all games, especially some years down the road.\n\nIs lowering the resolution to 1440p for better performance a viable option in that scenario? I've read that DLSS (which I'm not opposed to using) can help with the issue of 4K not being divisible by 1440p, upscaling something something. Is there a noticeable difference between this and running a game at 1440p on a 1440p monitor (my current setup)? ",

I've already tested the following models:\n\n* KTC M27P6 (1152-zone Mini LED, 4K, 27\"): The blooming is way too noticeable, especially when moving the mouse.\n* MO27Q2 (QD-OLED, 1440p, 27\"): Text clarity at 1440p on QD-OLED just isn't good enough for my taste.\n* MO32U2 (QD-OLED, 4K, 32\"): Text issues were pretty much gone here, but I was concerned that 4K might be overkill for me since I have a 9070XT and would often need to upscale. But is it really not good with FSR? I I mainly play League, Valorant and some AAA Games like Indiana Jones or Expedition 33\n* MO27Q28G (Tandem WOLED, 1440p, 27\"): In non-gaming scenarios, I found the gray banding quite severe, and text clarity still wasn't great.\n\nSo far, I haven't found the perfect fit. I think the MO32U2 was my favorite overall. OLED just looks amazing, but since I also use my monitor for office work, text clarity has been the main issue holding me back.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or recommendations? I'd really appreciate your help!",

    "selftext": "I'm trying to understand more about the intricate world of HDR, and since I didn't find any answers online I have a couple of questions.\nI've decided to switch to PC gaming, so I recently bought a good PC and a new tv. The tv is a Samsung QN90D, which according to RTINGS reaches 2100 nits in a 10% window, so I expected the HDR calibration tests to reach around that value, but in both the Windows 11 and PS5 tests the symbol disappears at around 1100 nits. it's a notable discrepancy.\nI should point out that HGiG (Samsung calls it Game HDR) is enabled and tone mapping is set to static. I did some comparisons to see how much the TV settings affected:\n● HGiG off, TM static = 1310 nits\n● HGiG on,  TM static = 1100 nits\n● HGiG off, TM active = 2200 nits\n● HGiG on,  TM active = 1100 nits\n\n1) I thought it might be due to the test window being 2/10% larger than the screen (so it might be correct to look at another value of RTINGS), but the Windows window seems to be around 10% of the screen.However, if the size does matter, then why is it that in the third step, when the screen is fully lit, the maximum visible nits are still 1100 with HGiG? Shouldn't they be less?\n\n2) Why can't I get around 2000 nits with HGiG enabled?",

    "title": "Long term usage of the AOC Q27G40XMN?",
    "selftext": "Howdy everyone,\n\nI just purchased 2 AOC Q27G40XMN monitors and I was wondering if anyone has used these extensively and can provide some insight as to their long term usage. The reviews on this monitor were kind of all over the place so I genuinely don't know what to expect. For my price range (under $500 for 2 27\" monitors) I feel like these are a great buy, even with some of their drawbacks.\n\nI was considering the AOC Q27G3XMN, which people seem to really like, but then came across a really good deal for this newer model which purportedly handles motion better and has a lot more dimming zones. Many of the people that didn't like the monitor mentioned \"black smearing\". I'm not really sure what \"black smearing\" is but I'm coming from a VA panel, so hopefully it's something I'm already used to and wont even notice. I know about the \"lottery\" in terms of firmware version and some people being plagued by the  \"desaturation bug\".\n\n>via Rtings:\n\n>There's also a bug when using the 'Strong' Local Dimming setting in the 'DisplayHDR' HDR Mode. Content looks overbrightened and desaturated, and it stays like this even when switching back to SDR or turning the monitor on and off again. The only way to stop the issue is by resetting the monitor. We don't recommend using the 'Strong' Local Dimming setting with the 'DisplayHDR' HDR Mode, and it's better to use 'Medium' instead because it doesn't have this bug. That said, this issue doesn't happen in any of the other HDR Modes.\n\nHopefully we are far enough out from the original manufacturing error that this is no longer an issue, but I will just use the \"medium\" settings if not.\n\nI am coming from a curved LC27F591FDNXZA which I bought all the way back in 2017, so I'm sure anything will feel like a massive upgrade for me. I just hope I'm happy with them as I don't like returning things and have a tendency to keep monitors for a LONG time. Needless to say, display tech has come a long way since I last looked into buying a monitor. I considered OLED, miniLED, VA/IPS, high refresh rate, and even ultrawide. I had a laundry list of other monitors I was considering but the finalists came down to:\n\nAOC Q27G40XMN\n\nAOC Q27G3XMN\n\nASUS XG27ACS\n\nPG27QFT1B\n\nI selected these based of a combination of reviews on RTINGS, this subreddit, and Monitors Unboxed. Additionally, price and availability were two major factors as well. I ended up going with the Q27G40XMN in part to find out if miniLED is as good as everyone says it is and also because I feel like for what I paid ($200 each) I couldn't pass it up. I understand it's a VA panel and everyone likes to shit on VA panels, but I'm coming from a VA panel, so I'm hoping it doesn't bother me.\n\nThe only real thing my Q27G40XMNs don't have that I really wanted is integrated speakers. Yes, I know they suck, but I just wanted them. It's a clutter thing not a sound quality thing. In fact one of the only reasons I was considering the PG27QFT1B was because it has integrated speakers and it was dirt cheap with seemingly good reviews.\n\nIf for some reason I'm unhappy with the these I will most likely return them and go the \"safe\" route and buy 2 ASUS XG27ACS for around the same price unless someone has a better suggestion.\n\nI'm hoping someone here has spent some real time with these monitors and can provide some insight, good OR bad. Additionally if anyone has any calibration, color correction, or settings they would like to share I would be super grateful.\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S: If I've made a huge mistake and should have bought something else please let me know ASAP! There's still time to cancel, lol!",

I do graphic designing and video editing work from time to time and I wanted to set my new monitors to display as accurate or flat of an image as possible, meaning neutral everything. I have a Samsung LS27A600U as my main HDR monitor and a Dell P2414H as my secondary. Now I know that these monitors aren't meant for productive work or color grading but I have to make do with what I have, and that's why I'm asking it here. I will post images of relevant settings that these monitors have here and it would be great if people here can help me set the best most neutral options for productive color grading work, obviously it would not result in the most accurate image representation but it would be better than running things as is.",

Just thought I'd mentioned that as monitor choice could apparently also be impacted by how the room is lit. I've heard displays like OLED with \"true blacks\" and \"infinite contrast\" are better suited for dark rooms.\n\nSomeone at my local electronics store recommended a Mini-LED display from TCL that uses \"HVA\" technology, which from my understanding is a technology developed by TCL themselves called High Vertical Alignment or High-Contrast Vertical Alignment, allegedly supposed to bridge the gap between IPS and VA by widening the viewing angles, but I can hardly find any info about it online other than what I just said.\n\nSo what type of display best suits my needs for gaming and productivity? Regular IPS? Mini-LED IPS? This weird Mini-LED HVA thing? Something else entirely? ",

    "selftext": "We’ve started a **partnership with Titan Army** and will be showcasing new models going forward (with honest community feedback) and probably some giveaways in the future. First up: two 27-inch 4K monitors both let you run **4K up to 160Hz** or switch to **1080p up to 320Hz** one is a straightforward fast IPS, the other adds full-array **Mini-LED** for real HDR and DyDs which is explained below.\n\n**P2712V (Fast IPS)**\n\n* **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** one-click dual mode\n* VRR (FreeSync/G-SYNC Compatible), **HDR400**\n* 2× HDMI 2.1 + DP; ergonomic stand *Use case:* 4K fidelity for single-player, 320Hz for shooters. [P2712V Link](https://bit.ly/4gmDFse)\n\n**P275MV Plus (Mini-LED with DyDs)**\n\n* Same **4K/160 ↔ 1080p/320** dual mode\n* **Mini-LED FALD (1152 zones), HDR1000**\n* **What is DyDs**: the backlight is driven in sync with the panel update to keep motion clean **with local dimming on** and to improve visibility in dark scenes (less smearing/black crush than typical FALD IPS). [P275MV Plus Link](https://bit.ly/4n4AVSL)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Being able to use 1080p for fast-paced games that benefit from high FPS, and switch to 4K for titles that thrive on visual fidelity, is a clear win for most players.\n* Titan Army is just entering EU/US more broadly, its always nice to have new competitors.\n\nWe’re currently testing the **C49SHC** 32:9 super ultrawide from Titan Army, so far we are really happy with the build quality and features overall. Its always good to have new competitors to bring prices down and have new QoL features implemented.",

I currently use a 10-bit ultrawide VA panel and would like to upgrade to improve video quality. Which of these two monitors would be the better choice? Or should I consider the Evnia 34\"? I know that OLED panels have reduced pixel degradation in recent years, but what about Philips's models? Would MiniLED be a safer option given its higher resolution? FYI, my GPU is an RX7900XT.",

I never had an issue with the power before but that seems to be the problem now, I unplugged the power cable to the monitor for about like a minute and plugged it back in. It starts to turn on then 5 seconds later shuts off and makes a noise that’s like a dvd player stopping. \n\nNow i’m assuming that I broke something and or misaligned it while i was screwing, but like with the sound it makes it makes, it sounds like it’s short circuiting or something.

    "selftext": "Hello\n\nI'm in the process of changing my current setup, which will include an adjustable desk with a shelf large enough to accommodate the PS5 and Mac Mini, as well as half-monitor screens on top.\n\nMy problem is finding the balance between Work/Gaming when it comes to monitors. I was looking into two options:\n\n1. An UltraWide monitor, 34\". I know PS doesn't support it, and it's going to be 16:9 with black pillars, and I don't care about that **as long as it supports 120Hz while in 16:9 on the Ultrawide.** Do you guys have any recommendations on this? Preferably ones that you are currently using or have used in the past.\n2. 2x 27\" Monitors, one premium that will be plugged into both the PS5 and Mac mini, and I will switch between Mac/Ps5 input when I need it, and another 27\" not-so-premium that will be connected just to the Mac Mini.\n\nThe problem here is that I don't want an Oled, since I will be working as well the burn-in will accelerate. The Recommendations I got on the internet, like Alienware AW2725Q or Asus PG32UCDM have some problems with PS5(as seen on reddit or other forums).\n\nI'd like to make the best out of the PS5 like: VRR, true HDMR, HDMi2.1, 4k 120hz, ALLM(this one ain't a hard requirement since Monitors have lower input lag than TVs).\n\nAnything that you could recommend here? My budget is about 800-900 euros for the 27\".\n\nAround 1000-1200 for 34\".\n\nThank you!",

I’ve been eyeing the PG32UCDM I know it’s a 4k monitor, but I was wondering if it’s possible to play it in 2k rather than 4k I heard it’s blurry but if that’s the case I can try 4k if my set up can handle it. I really like the size of this monitor and prefer the 32”, going to 27” would need some getting used to. I play warzone rarely and play bf6 sometimes but mostly play non competitive games online with friends or by myself. I also play 2k26 on the p5. But the monitor is mostly for pc gaming. Any help would be appreciated thanks! ",

    "title": "Wf-1000XM5 vs Bose QC Ultra earbuds compared after 1 year of use",
    "selftext": "I own both, and use both extensively. Typically, the Bose is used at home while the XM5s are used during my morning commute (train) and at work. However I've done it the other way around countless times.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nI love the ANC on the headphone version of the XM5s, so I know it's great. However for the earphone XM5s, the adaptive ANC feature lets so much sound in at standard levels that it's frankly irritating how much sound it lets in. Whether it's the desk fan, the compressor on my fridge, or the ambient noises of a commuter train. Meanwhile, the Bose blocks almost everything to the point of near-silence.\n\nOn a flight, I'd say they're near equal, but the Bose comes out ahead for consistency.\n\n*Winner: Bose*\n\n**Comfort:**\n\nHighly subjective but the XM5s just fit in my ear better, despite a smoother exterior profile. The Bose have a rubber ridge that's meant to more snugly rest on your inner ear, but when I smile/laugh or brush my teeth, the Bose have a tendency to wriggle themselves loose. They've never fallen out entirely, but I'd need to readjust them.\n\n*Winner: Sony*\n\n**Sound Quality:**\n\nBose hands down. The XM5s midrange sounds way too hollow, and compared to my other headphones and IEMs, even the headphone XM5s, it makes listening to my music unpleasant.\n\nWinner: Bose\n\n**Charging Case:**\n\nSony's charging case stands up tall, so you can open the case while it's resting on a table surface. Meanwhile, the Bose case lays flat on its back, so you need to pick it up to open it. It also takes up more desk space.\n\nHowever, that means that the Sony charging case holds roughly 50-60% (in my experience) the charge of the Bose's case.\n\n*Winner: No clear winner here. I don't mind having a smaller charge in return for a smaller case.*\n\n**Default User Experience**\n\nWhen you put on the Sony, there is a gentle boop sound when it's connected to your devices, and a quiet voice reminder when the battery gets too low.\n\nOn the Bose, when the earphones start up, it proceeds to play basically the THX logo sound directly into your ears every single time. Then when it connects to a device, the robotic AI voice says the device name every time, even if the device name is really long. If you have multiple devices you need to wait to play whatever you were trying to listen to. I promptly disabled voice prompts but it still talks when I switch audio modes. Whose stupid idea was this.\n\nWinner: Sony\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFor most people, I'd recommend the XM5s despite the annoying adaptive ANC feature and audio quality, since using it is overall just less abrasive on a day to day basis.\n\nBut if you want more charge out of your case, and your ambient environment is consistently noisy, get the Bose and just never worry about background noise ever again.",

Toppings DAC/AMP/PRE which now has their 1-bit DAC architecture and their somewhat controversial NFCA amp modules. I'm expecting a snappy, separated, lean-leaning sound, but worried about it being too smooth (1-bit nature) having owned the D90 Discrete III recently, which is a very good and smooth DAC, just not sure if it's the right signature for the LCD-4? The LCD-4 is already smooth in the treble and could use some added bite and incisiveness there.\n\nAnother area of concern is potentially shallow stage depth, a common complaint with their NFCA amp tech. I love the power output specs and\nPEQ is a really nice addition though.\n\n\n[Cayin iH8-A]\n\nSuper powerful true class A, amp only. Has a hyper bottom that supercharges the sound to become more dynamic and incisive. \n\n\n\nThe question really here is: does the LCD-4 in particular benefit from powerful class A or a more analytically leaning yet powerful NFCA Topping amp? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You hear every detail in perfect harmony. But it’s like eating French fries without a dip. I like eating a few like that, because a few will taste good without a dip. I might, if the French fries are that good, eat the whole thing without dip once or twice. But generally, even if it covers up some of the French fry flavor, I still want a dip like ketchup. Basically, being a little bass heavy or treble heavy gives music a little spice, and it’s definitely better for every day use if you find it to sound better to you. So, I say there’s a limit, but for me. I like a tiny bit of ketchup with my fries thank you very much 😤\n\nPS: my favorite headphones audio wise are the Skullcandy Aviator 900 ANCs.

In the case of the first song, I believe the culprit is the Expanded Edition of the album, but I just can't find the original one in CD quality (digital) for offline use. Both FLAC versions are mixed too loudly (and don't feel as dynamic, though this might be placebo) and have artifacts that aren't (as) present on YouTube, otherwise YouTube is just as crisp and detailed, absolutely nothing is missing, it's just that it's a higher quality master and not that FLAC is more revealing... \n\nI would immensely appreciate help because the 1st song is arguably the most spectacular one I've ever heard on my HD 600, and the 2nd one has really great vocals and layering.\n\nOn a side note, about different file formats and masters:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw)\n\nI thought this sounded great, but the FLAC version actually has noticeably more treble and bass which sound really, really great, not boosted and distorted at all. This is not because of FLAC because if you take that FLAC file, drop it in Audacity and export as a 128 kbps MP3, it's all still there unlike on YouTube, so some masters are really just different and it's not a matter of 128 kbps MP3 being audibly worse than up to 24-bit 192 kHz FLAC, really.

    "selftext": "I know this has been beat to death multiple times with multiple sticks, but I was scrapin' the web and didn't end up satisfied - was looking for some more opinions. \n\nI have owned my HD600's for awhile now - a few years probably, and they were one of my first non-completely-crap headphones after using some ear splitty Sony's and BD's. I originally got them for mixing, as I was not really into audiophile listening with headphones (had decent speakers), but they I got bit by the bug. I have a few pairs I really like now, but I have always been curious about the other HD alternatives.\n\nIn my search for that beautiful midrange timber with some more heft in the bass, I got the HD660S2's not long after they were released. They were also really smooth, with great timbre, but even more \"veiled\" and after a year or two, I decided they were not for me, and moved them on. I kept the HD600's, but mostly as a reference, because the bass roll off displeases me. I would never reach for them over, for example, the Edition XS. Totally different sound signature, each with advantages and disadvantages, but overall, that's where that fell out for me.\n\nOn a lark, I just saw the 650's for $300 on Amazon, which is a pretty low price (might still be there if you are reading this soon after it posts - I literally just clicked on them) so I snagged them. I figure I will probably not like them better than the 600 and will send them back, but the curiosity is killing me. A lot of people say they are just a more warmer or even muffled 600, and some say they are an improvement.  I guess I will find out, but I am really curious to hear some fresh opinions from users of both. Which do you prefer and why? Are they both just out of date, with all the great sub $500 offerings out there these days? Not to mention the >$500 offerings.\n\nIn return for your opinions, I will share mine once I get these on my head for a week or so, and get a good solid impression. I am expecting to be underwhelmed. I kinda wonder if I need a tube amp to properly appreciate the HD6XO line. I really like my current dac/amp (dx9), but I could add a modestly priced tube amp to the arsenal.",

    "title": "Flux FA-10: Brutal Power, \"Nervous\" Character",
    "selftext": "​I was looking for a powerful and clean-sounding Solid State (SS) amplifier for my HE6se V2 headphones when I stumbled upon this Flux FA-10 on sale for €350 shipped. So, I pulled the trigger. Now I'm here with this Class A \"beast,\" capable of delivering a staggering 16W into 32 ohms (10.5W into 64 ohms).\n​Overall, the sound was... adequate. But let me unpack this a little bit further.\n\n\n**​An Aggressive Presentation**\n\n​I don't want to complain about the cleanliness and detail this unit brings to the table on some (though not all) of my headphones, but I genuinely dislike its aggressive and 'in your face' presentation. \nIt sounds tense, like a nervous person trying to tell a fairy tale to a child. Granted, I'm coming from tube amps like my Eufonika OTL, or the relaxed sound of the Mojo 2, but... I wasn't expecting this kind of house sound from Flux.\nI usually associate Class A with a slightly warm character and a rolled-off treble, which this device is definitively not.\n\n\n**​Lack of Dynamics on Elex and HE6**\n\n​The HE6 and the Elex are among the most punchy and dynamic headphones on the market. The Elex can sound punchy even if connected to a [potato](https://www.instructables.com/Potato-Battery-Understanding-Chemical-and-Electric/), and the HE6 demands significant power to fully express its dynamic nature.\nNevertheless, with the FA-10, both headphones sound unimpressive dynamically, especially the Elex, which really surprised me.\nI usually plug them into an Aliexpress dongle or the Chord Mojo 2 and am always satisfied with the bass impact.\n​The Elex's punchiness seems irrecoverable even with EQ, which only introduces mud into the sound. The HE6, however, can regain some of its impact through equalization.\n\n\n***​Note***: It is important not to confuse the role of EQ. It can add bass quantity, but the violence of the attack of a bass note is what dictates its physical impact. This is a physical characteristic that does not solely relate to the Frequency Response (FR). For example, the FiiO FT1 has much more bass than the Elex, but it sounds way less punchy.\n\n​The Elex sounds somewhat muddy and poorly controlled compared to the Mojo 2, while the HE6 sounds largely as its graph suggests.\n\n\n**Decent ​Synergy with the HD660S2**\n\n​The Sennheiser HD660S2 has a very relaxed sound signature (with some sparkle around 6-8kHz). They actually sound good with this amp because it balances their chill presentation, occasionally making them sound aggressive too.\n\n\n**​Strengths Worth Highlighting**\n\n​Despite my criticisms, I want to highlight the amp's strengths:\n- ​Incredible Power: It runs my HE6se V2 on low gain, using only 3/4 of the volume knob.\n- ​Pristine Cleanliness and Detail: The sound is dead clean and highly detailed.\n- ​Stage and Separation: The stage is a decent, medium size, and the imaging and instrumental separation are top-notch for the price.\n- Flexible Inputs: It accepts balanced inputs, but since it's a pure single-ended device, both the SE and balanced outputs should sound virtually the same. This is a great feature, making the FA-10 more flexible regarding the source you feed it.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n​Ultimately, I would never recommend this amp to people sensitive to the 3-4kHz region like myself. This amplifier is a cannon for those frequencies (from a presentation standpoint). If you have a warm and relaxed headphone, it can truly wake it up. But for neutral to bright headphones, especially aggressive ones like the HE6 and Elex... proceed at your own risk!\n",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m running into a bit of a challenge getting enough power for my main headphones from my Focusrite Scarlett 4th Gen 2i2. The interface itself is great for tracking and monitor control, but the headphone out just doesn’t have the juice I need for the Dan Clark AEON closed X which I love. Need it to record and track etc. \n\nI’ve tried a couple of external DAC/amp setups (one distorted badly from the Scarlett’s line outs, the other colored the sound more than I liked), and I’m now trying to figure out the *right* way to integrate an external amp or DAC/amp combo without messing up my monitor chain. \n\nMy Scarlett’s main outputs are already feeding my studio monitors, so I’m not sure of the best wiring approach. I tried Y splitters so I can keep the monitors as well as TRS to RCA on the zH3 by Fosi, it distorted. On the Schiit Magni it didn’t until higher levels but it did not sound good at all so I returned it. \n\nBasically I’m trying to answer:\n\n* What’s the cleanest way to add a dedicated headphone amp (or DAC/amp) to a Scarlett interface when the main outs are already used for monitors? Should I just upgrade to Topping E2x2 Audio Interface?\n\n* Are there any level-matching or wiring tricks to avoid distortion when feeding an external amp from an interface?\n\n* Would it make more sense to just switch to something like a Topping L50 as just amp (would it make a difference in the wiring) or FiiO k7 (has a DAC though.) I wanted to use the DAC just for pleasure casual listening outside my DAW. \n\nI’d prefer to keep using the Scarlett if possible (and definitely not use ASIO4ALL), but I’m open to what most people do for this type of setup.\n\nAppreciate any advice.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I don't talk on here very often but I had been searching for headphones after my last pair which lasted me about 13 years (Sennheiser HD598's) and still worked fine.\n\nI settled on the Aune AR5000's because they fit my pricepoint. I got them, EQ'd them and fell in love with that nice creamy bass.\n\nThat was exactly 14 months ago. For my usage I babied them, was always gentle despite the feeling of sturdy construction, and adored them. Never dropped.\n\nI have a small'ish to medium head. When I would use my pc I would simply pick them up and put them on like any other headphone.\n\nToday I wake up and the absolute weirdest thing happen, I went to put them on but they weren't... feeling right, I checked and YEP, they had cracked from soft usage after a year. I had seen other users with the pin for the ear support coming out because it was plastic but thought it would never happen to me because I'm so gentle with them.\n\nI have emailed my retailer and aune to see what they say but I'm pretty sure I'm SOL.\n\nMy advice? DO NOT BUY. This isn't a quality control problem, its a design and fundamental flaw in having that section made from plastic.\n\nI'm livid and now have to go searching for new headphones AGAIN.\n\n\n\nEDIT: If aune refuse to help I will investigate the replacement bands, or just outright upgrade to a pair of Meze 105's\n\nThese headphones were great for gaming and music and I feel the 105's have a better looking construction.\n\nAlso after plugging my over decade old HD598's they sound almost as good as the Aune AR5000's. So I think my over-enthusiasm for their sound might have been for reasons I can't explain. These are 90% the headphone sound of them and considering the age of them, that's hilarious.",

    "title": "Audeze LCD5 with EQ is .... WOW (what took me so long)",
    "selftext": "So Ive had a couple of superb  headphones, of which my favorites have been the U12T Iem, Utopia 2022, KSE1200, yet none touch the speaker setup, but thats more to do with physicality.  Anyways, I always loved the technicality of the LCD5 for mixing but hated its tonality for music enjoyment, as its not enjoyable relative to the Utopia, or even the U12t.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xict0bc0iyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd00e3b32336bb99067869b285106ebc701b94c9\n\nAnyways having recently gotten the U12Ts I was very impressed, as they are pretty damn technical, yet also enjoyable for music enjoyment, and dont require EQ or anything.   I used to EQ the KSE1200 for example which I still think performs technically better than anything else I have, but its a pain....  So that comparison is what got me curious about WHAT IF I spend some time to EQ the LCD5 with a phase linear plugin.\n\nANYWAYS, this is what this post is about:\n\nThe U12T got me curious about adding EQ to the LCD5, and then I saw other people often complain about the LCD5 until they EQ it.  I used the Utopia 2022, as a reference for a tuning I enjoy.  I found in mac the app soundSource allows me to use some of the same software I use for mixing and mastering, to EQ these things.   After EQing it, it punches like the Utopia, but the resolution is still that of the most detailed headphone I have ever heard. Im gonna get hate for this, but even the Stax SR009 doesnt do bass like the LCD5 (or at least I imagine as I dont have them side by side, but I remember it doesnt do bass like the Utopia in terms of weight). With EQ the LCD5 is just WOW.   Now the downside however is this is a pain in the ass to have to setup.\n\nThe setup:\n\n•⁠  ⁠I  found a software in the MAC called soundsource that allows applying corrective curves and also some of the same plugins used for mastering.\n\n•⁠  ⁠On the above software Audeze LCD-5 was setup to Oratory reference.  This corrects some imbalances but also sounds a bit dull next to the Utopia when set to the same curve for example.\n\n•⁠  ⁠To correct that, I then follow this by adding a hi pass WAY below the hearing range at 16hz to help the driver work better not dealing with stuff I cannot hear anyways.   Then I re-add some of the frequencies in the 2.6k nd 5.1k (only about 2-3db), which are frequencies dulled by the oratory curve, in this headphone. This brings a bit of that character I like in vocals in the Utopia, but smooth like the LCD5's are good at.\n\nThe LCD5 can take HUGE gain vai EQ without distorting. Its honestly really impressive.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02k9l6yk0iyf1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b89d90635e2e02a6427c642433eeac833cb9b7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f6te6yk0iyf1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=009b587ecf81fffbbfaf2f95aa2aa5bdae0c7732",

    "title": "A New Study on the Equivalence of Harman OE Target on Modern Test Fixtures, Co-authored by Sean Olive and Dan Clark Audio",
    "selftext": "> Summarized by Qwen.\n\nFor years, the *Harman target*—a frequency response profile derived from extensive double-blind listening tests—has served as a benchmark for “neutral” or preferred headphone sound. Originally defined using a specific GRAS 45CA test fixture equipped with a custom “Welti” pinna and an RA045 (Type 3.3) ear simulator, this target has become widely referenced in both research and product development.\n\nHowever, a critical issue has emerged: many modern labs and manufacturers now use newer test fixtures—such as the **GRAS 45CA-10** (with KB5000 anthropomorphic pinna and RA0402 ear simulator) and the **Brüel & Kjær Type 5128** (featuring a Type 4.3 ear simulator compliant with ITU-T P.57). These fixtures differ acoustically from the original Harman setup, particularly in their **acoustic transfer impedance**, especially below 500 Hz and above 3 kHz. Applying the original Harman target directly to measurements from these newer systems can lead to misinterpretation—and potentially misguided tuning decisions.\n\nIn a new paper presented at the **AES 159th Convention** (October 2025), **Sean Olive** (the architect of the Harman target) and **Dan Clark** address this problem head-on. Their work defines *Harman-equivalent targets* specifically calibrated for the GRAS 45CA-10 and B&K 5128 fixtures, ensuring that headphones tuned to these revised targets will sound subjectively similar to those tuned to the original Harman reference.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe authors measured seven diverse headphones including open-back and closed-back models from Dan Clark Audio, HiFiMan, and Sennheiser—on all three fixtures (original Welti, GRAS 45CA-10, and B&K 5128). Using a straightforward calibration method in Room EQ Wizard (REW), they derived fixture-specific targets by:\n\n1. Measuring each headphone on both the original and new fixtures.\n2. Computing the ratio between responses (e.g., KB5000 / Welti).\n3. Applying this ratio to the original Harman target (phase-conjugated and smoothed) to generate a new, equivalent target.\n\nThis process accounts for the unique acoustic loading and leakage characteristics of each fixture.\n\n## Listening Tests Confirm Validity\n\nTo validate the approach, the team conducted controlled **MUSHRA-style listening tests** with 13 experienced listeners, comparing seven versions of the target:\n\n- The original Harman target (Reference)\n- Fixture-specific targets calibrated per headphone\n- Targets averaged across 7 or 20 headphones\n\nResults were clear: when headphones were equalized to their **fixture-specific, individually calibrated targets**, they sounded **nearly identical** to the original Harman reference. In statistical terms, the **B&K 5128** and **GRAS 45CA-10** targets (calibrated per model) were **not significantly different** from the reference in perceived similarity.\n\nBy contrast, targets derived from **averages across multiple headphones** (e.g., “5128_20”) scored lower—though still within the “very similar” range—highlighting that **individual calibration yields the best match**.\n\nInterestingly, the type of headphone (open vs. closed-back) had minimal impact on results, suggesting the method is robust across designs.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nFor engineers and audiophiles alike, this work resolves a long-standing ambiguity: **you cannot directly apply the classic Harman target to measurements taken on modern fixtures** and expect accurate tuning. Instead, fixture-specific equivalents are needed.\n\nEncouragingly, the differences between targets are often correctable with **simple bass and treble shelving filters**, as most deviations occur in well-defined frequency regions. This opens the door for more consistent, cross-platform headphone evaluation—and more reliable interpretations of published measurements.\n\nWhile the study focused on seven models, the calibration framework is generalizable. Future work may yield standardized correction targets for common fixtures, enabling broader adoption without per-headphone measurement.\n\n## Reference\n\nOlive, S., & Clark, D.

    "title": "Arya Organic…Wow",
    "selftext": "My thoughts on the Arya Organics (I know there’s plenty of reviews etc, but what harm can another do)\n\nI jumped into this hobby about 2 years ago roughly. Through that time, I’ve been through plenty headphones, but the only ones I spent a LOT of time with was 2. The Arya Stealth, and the HD560s. \n\n(Skip further down if you don’t care about the previous stories)\n\nThe Stealths were mind blowing to me, I did have planars before these. The edition xs (felt way too cheap for the 300 mark at the time. The Ananda Nanos (clamped like a vice). So picked up the Arya Stealths for £710, which was their cheapest price at the time. I owned these for 6 months. Every time I put them on, I was astounded at the sound. However, after 2 months, I rarely used them, I didn’t have the time to listen, and didn’t want £700 lying around. So I reluctantly sold them, and decided to pick up the cheaper pair, the HD560s. So I could still enjoy music, without feeling guilty having some premium set collecting dust. And these were fine, for £90, they were great.\n\nRecently however I’m now in a position where I have a lot more free time, and for that reason, I wanted to pick up a higher end headphone again. I was debating between many, but in the end it kept boiling down to the Stealths, which were now £460. But then saw the Organics were just £120 extra as “open-box” from Hifiman. One thing I absolutely hated with the Stealths was how harsh some of the treble was, and at the time I didn’t have EQ. So I was stuck with harsh treble in a few songs I enjoyed other times. Between owning the 560s and Stealths, I did pick up the JDS Element 4 Dac/Amp in preparation for higher end cans in the future, and to play around with EQ. So hearing the Organics had a harsh treble, it didn’t really deter me as I had the capabilities to town it down.\n\nSo now onto the Organics…\n\nLOOKS:\nThese things are absolutely gorgeous! It’s like taking your grandads beautifully varnished wooden table and chairs, and adding a modern touch to it. It makes them stand out and look far more premium than the price suggests (I’m aware they were 1500 odd on release, but on current pricing, the point stands). They feel more premium for this matter. I the one massive negative, is you have to wear them to listen, meaning I can’t just stare at them when in use. \n\nCOMFORT:\nAnyone who’s familiar with the Arya lineup, know that this line of headphones are on the comfier side of the Hifiman brand. They clamp just enough to not feel loose, but not too hard that it feels like the hulk is crushing your skull (Nanos). Yes the pads aren’t the most comfy pads on any headphone, they’re actually the one aspect I don’t like. They don’t feel premium, and the fabric design sometimes catches the odd strand of hair which isn’t pleasant. However changing these means altering the sound, which you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, want to do. The headband is perfect though. Suspended straps are my favourite on headphones, adds a premium feel, look and feels like far less pressure on your head. Not to mention how wide they are, it helps distribute the weight so well.\n\nUNBOXING: \nDead, £5 unboxing experience, but realistically who cares…\n\nSOUND:\nGrand. Exciting. Smooth. \n\nThe 3 words I’d use to describe the sound. Which goes to show how versatile they are. They give off such a ‘grand’ feeling, when you listen to orchestral pieces, it feels like you’re in a theatre listening to a band playing, but like you’re middle row. Not first row where it feels in your face, and not back row that it feels like it’s far away. It’s that perfect middle ground where it’s around you, but so that you can hear everything so cleanly. They’re exciting in the sense that after an orchestral piece, you put on an EDM track, pop or anything in that region, and it feels like you want to get up and just dance, but don’t, as these probably would fall off your head. And then you go for a very vocal focused piece of music, and the smoothness of the voice just glides through your ears. There’s no moment where it’s aggressive (unless it needs to be) or where it holds back. It’s like an electric supercar. You put your foot down, and it picks up straight away, but with no aggression, just picks up and gets going right away. \n\nOnto the specifics:\n\nBASS - Very solid. Definitely stronger than the Arya Stealths. When I had them, the bass was there, but it needed a tad more punch. These add that very subtle punch, where you know it’s bass, but it doesn’t slip into the other frequencies and overthrow them. It’s controlled VERY well. The sub bass is fantastic too. My favourite song to test this is “The Droid Invasion and the Appearance of Darth Maul” from The Phantom Menace. The drums at the start provide that sub bass test and it really shows how it handles it well. Doesn’t get fatiguing, just presents it so smoothly. Not to mention how clear the drums sound, like you can visualise the fabric drum stick hitting against the massive drum. The bass is also quick when needing to be. In many pop songs where there is the common use of bass, or in rap music, it’ll show the bass, and stop it perfectly. It never feels like it over presents itself. They also hold the bass off so well from overpowering the mids. Many headphones either make the bass so minimal that you don’t realise there should be bass, and many push it so hard it dims down the vocals. These control it so so well.\n\nMIDS - I would say the weakest out of the Low, Mid and High ends. Definitely NOT bad, it’s really really great. However when there is consistent bass present, and a lot of higher end or many many instruments playing, the vocals definitely take a seat back. They’re still very clear, but it pushes the instruments forward a bit more. Which isn’t bad at all, and some people may prefer this. It’s more of a preference thing. I certainly don’t mind it, and it’s not something I’m gonna be quickly to go and EQ, but if I was, it’s the first thing I’d play with, just to bring them forward a touch. BUT, when there’s only a low end and vocals, or high end and vocals, they are stunning. They just sound so real and ‘organic’, it’s like having a conversation with David Attenborough, just so nicely spoken and a voice you wish could commentate on your whole life. \n\nHIGHS - Lies were told here, or obviously it’s just down to personal hearing. But these are NOT ‘peaky’ or ‘harsh’. The high end is so well controlled. With the Arya Stealth, I absolutely could not listen to Nightcall - Kavinsky from Drive. The chorus of the song was so harsh I literally couldn’t listen to it. So the first song I wanted to try was that, and on these I could listen to the entire song with no issues. They have just enough brightness to make everything sound clean and clear, but not too much that it comes across as piercing during songs. Same with Time - Pink Floyd. The start with all the clocks can be very piercing with poorly controlled highs, but it’s like the headphones actively know it’s going to sound harsh and presents them just a tone down so that you don’t have to turn the volume down or skip forward. It was my one worry with these, and although EQ is an option, I did want to enjoy them stock for as long as possible. Which I’m ecstatic with the fact I can.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE - Wide, but not artificially wide, just naturally wide. Like I said with the orchestral hall and being “grand”. It just sounds so perfectly deep. It’s not like the sound is coming from across the room, but it’s not like the song is being played right next to you. It’s similar to car speakers, in the way it’s all round you, but not as if you’re listening to the persons car next to you. It’s intimate enough that you feel like it’s YOUR music, not someone else’s near you, but also distant enough that it’s like it’s your own personal concert. \n\nSEPARATION - Always tough because if a song is produced badly, even the greatest ever headphones won’t be able to separate the parts. But in a well produced track, you can actively hear each and every instrument and voice. In “Call it what you want” by Taylor Swift, there’s many instances where there are backing vocals playing over Taylor, and you can hear each one clearly, but as if they’re actually behind her. Like Taylor’s singing into your ear, whilst the backing singer is sat 2 foot behind her also singing, but you can clearly tell one is the main, one is the backing. The 560s definitely struggled with this, you often couldn’t hear the multiple voices, so now listening to many songs, I’m hearing voices I didn’t realise were there (I actually checked on 2 occasions that I wasn’t listening to a remix).\n\nConclusion:\nYes. Just yes. Stellar\n\nSetup I’m using:\nHifiman Arya Organic -> JDS Element 4 -> MacBook M3 -> Audirvana (because Tidal is buggy as anything on Mac since iOS 26 and Apple Music doesn’t auto change the Sample Rate) \n",

    "selftext": "[UPDATE: I realized my amp has a low gain mode and my headphones have an impedance of 70, so it's pretty likely the high gain mode was messing with the noise on louder stuff]\n\n\nI'm making this post solely because I was listening to my setup last night, a Schiit Lyr 3 tube amp and Audeze LCD 2c. I was specifically listening to my favorite release this year, which is Revengeseekerz by Jane Remover. It is a\npretty loud and sometimes harsh electronic album that I've heard many times at this point through DT 990s but not through this setup.\n\nI noticed what I thought was peaking during some parts, but ultimately began to deduce it to the music just not being very well mixed and mastered for high-end listening application, but I'm still not 100% sure. The music is gritty, dirty, and honestly very fun to listen to. \n\nTruthfully the reason why I mention any of this is because I want to keep my things nice and prevent any wear, in other words, I want to protect my investment the best I can but I'm unsure if music like this (or any music) can really be considered \"unsafe\".\n\nI'll add, I am not listening at high volumes during this album, nor do I have anything EQ'd weirdly, it is essentially just a tube amp, a 6SN7 tube, and the headphones.\n\nIf anybody would want to hear what I'm talking\nabout, some songs I was questioning are all by Jane Remover:\n\nDreamflasher, movies for guys, Experimental Skin, search party.\n\nOnce again, I'm aware these songs are supposed to sound gritty, but there are also some more clear and crisp sections in each of these, so I'm trying to decide if I should embrace the grit and imperfections of these songs through the LCD 2c if it's safe, or continue on my Beyers.",

This is erratic and random sometimes it doesn't! This tinnitus type noise goes away after a few seconds! And comes back when music is paused and it's a repeat cycle!(And no this isn't ANC noise coz it happens when even ANC IS OFF and only happens on the left ear driver/ hardware). And for this price i except a premium consistent experience, NOT this!\n\nAnd secondly, also only the left side earpad makes a mild squeaky toy noise when pressed, but right earpad is dead SILENT even when it's pressed. Is this is how it is suppose to be? Also ironically when earpads were interchanged, SURPRISE surprise! STILL only left side earpads makes this mild squeaky noise when pressed and whilst trying to wear it! (Despite the same earpad when on the right driver is dead SILENT and left earpads is silent on right?!)\n\nAnd thirdly!, the return policy is NON-EXISTENT! In my country!  And when asked about it throught their painfully call with executive they said RESET IT which I had already done MULTIPLE TIMES and tried MULTIPLE DEVICES from latest Android, IPAD AND MacBook Pro. Still it's persistent (random and occasional mild white noise/ mechanical noise from left ear driver alone)\n\nThey gave me an ultimatum to even get it checked I HAVE TO Ship my brand new expensive headphone AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND OWN RISK To their warehouse ACROSS THE COUNTRY! And after sonova took over all the service center were closed except one with courier-in type service center!\n\nMany told that the white noise/ TINNITUS issue SPECIFICALLY Left driver one is kinda common. Can you guys as confirm this for me and also other FUTURE BUYERS. Can you check and test in SILENT room with pausing after playing music.\n\nLastly, is this the QUALITY CONTROL by a 'TRUSTED' german brand? And hassle is almost unbearable and everytime I PAUSE I get left ear driver making a very mild tinnitus sound randomly! \n\nu/sennheiserconsumer\n",

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

    "title": "Avantone Pro Planar the II - Impressive underdog?",
    "selftext": "First of all I want to emphasize - I'm by no means a audio aficionado, just ur regular hifi enjoyer I would say.  \nStarted my journey in my teens with some cheap ass amp + bookshelf setup which at the time was still way better than anything you could get from the electronic store next door.   \nAnyway back to the topic - HEADPHONES. Been using a lot of \"High-End\" Consumer Devices on the go, Sennheiser, Sony, Bose, \\*cough\\* Apple \\*cough\\* - Jokes aside, and for the past years i've been rocking my AKG K712 Pro at home being driven by my Onboard DAC/Amp on my PC.   \nThe AKG were already a WOW moment for me compared to those big brand Consumer devices at the time and to this day I love those cans. Still going strong after 10 years.   \nSound - Clear, Punchy and no headache even after hours listening at extensive volume. And the Soundstage? Phenomenal. \n\nHaving said that, I hope you got the reference to what I will be comparing the Avantone to.\n\nQuick mention - I do drive my Headphones with the Fiio K11 R2R since a couple weeks, which already improved the sound of the AKG by a mile compared to the onboard solution.\n\n\\- Avantone Planar 2 Impression starts here -\n\nOut of the box first impressions were not too overwhelming, they are fairly unimpressive at first glance from a visual standpoint, the boxy \"cheese grater\" design looks actually kinda nice in the polished black colour I got here tho.  \nBuild quality is very solid, compared to all my previous headphones which were all just big chunks of plastic you get a solid metal frame, fairly thick leather strap which also has the width to spread the enormous weight of the headphones across your head so they actually do NOT feel heavy at all.  \nThe AKG already had comfortable Velour Pads but damn, those Pads on the Avantone are silky smooth and nice to touch.\n\nNow to the sound,\n\nOut-of-the-box: Not to impressive if you ask me. I felt like something was \"missing\" compared to the AKG. Everything felt kinda flat and very narrow in comparison.  \nBy no means did they sound bad, but just.. boring?  \nHaving said that, the low-end did have more punch and they also provided more details in busy passages. It was just uninspired and so narrow, as if you were stuck in a small box.  \nAt that point I was contemplating if the price tag of 429€ was worth it or if I should return them.   \n  \nBut then I gave em another shot after researching a bit and applied an EQ (Self Tweaked Version of the u/Oratory1990 EQ for the first iteration of the Avantone Planar) via APO (Peace Interface) and I was simply shocked.  \nIt really opened up the stage and completely removed the feeling of being boxed in. They take the EQ as if they were made for it.   \n  \nThe low end got even more punch without any signs of being too much for the driver. The midrange is just as detailed as before but the elevated treble is what enhances the whole experience to new heights. As I described earlier everything sounds alive, the stage is wider and most importantly - It's fun! (Which I feel like is a point a lot of people forget to talk about)  \n\n\nBy no means do I have the equipment to measure those things or the extensive knowledge to compare it to hundred other headphones in different price brackets.   \nI cant tell you, especially after applying the EQ, if they follow some imaginary \"perfect\" frequency response curve.  \nAll I can say is - I love those things after applying the EQ and will keep them for a long time to come! \n\nThat is all from me, if there is anything you would like me to add feel free to ask in the comments as this is my first \"review\" I probably missed a ton of important stuff.\n\nCheers y'all!",

    "title": "PSA: Aune's Official Store charges import fees to US customers, no mention of this anywhere on their website",
    "selftext": "I ordered the AC45 from Aune's Official Store (mall.auneaudio.com) as I wasn't sure how long it would be before they're more widely available in the US and whether they would be carried by any of their distributors since they're a fairly niche product category. Shipping to the US was free which is nice but at no point was there any mention that they wouldn't handle import fees (tariffs) on their end before the product was shipped and I didn't think anything of it since I've had multiple orders from China where the seller handled everything ahead of time which is the proper way to do it. Today I got an email from UPS that I need to pay for the import fees on a shipment and I knew right away what it was for, ended up paying $27 of which $15 went to UPS for their BS charges to handle the import paperwork and processing. I'm a little annoyed at Aune since not only do they not mention this on their website or at checkout but they also picked the worst possible shipping option since DHL, FedEx, and UPS are known to be POS companies that charge extra fees on top of the actual import fee for essentially doing nothing. If they had shipped it via the postal service it wouldn't have been as big of an issue since they won't charge that extra fee and I would've only had to pay $12 in stead of $27. So if you're in the US and are thinking about ordering from Aune directly be prepared to pay extra on top of what the item costs, it's worth getting their products through other sellers if you can even if the price is slightly higher than their own store is selling them for to avoid these extra charges and the added hassle.\n\nP.S. I know that Aune isn't entirely to blame since this wouldn't be an issue at all if it wasn't for the current joke of an administration pretending to run this country but it's also the current reality that we're forced to live with and other companies have handled it much better than Aune has. If they had taken the time to figure out what the best option was instead of basically ignoring it and making their customers deal with the aftermath this wouldn't be an issue.",

    "title": "Babies First Audiophile Introduction (Tuning)",
    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

    "selftext": "Hello, I haven’t really seen much coverage of this product online, and I thought it deserves some more attention so I will try to share my thoughts.\n\nThis headphone is not available in many countries, but I was able to buy it from Aliexpress for around £20($26) including postage. A retro-style lightweight Bluetooth openback headphones from Philips to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\n\nIn this product category, the closest competitor I could think of is Koss porta pro, Kph30i or the wireless koss porta pro all of which cost more than this product. I’ve also compared it to some grados and my HD6XX and HD560s.\n\nGiven the price range, I was shocked at the tonal balance and the resolution. I would say Grado and Koss both have a very distinct texture of sound that makes it sound really cheap with little bass. In my ears, Ringo definitely has a more balanced V shape sound signature and has less of that cheap texture to the sound. Given my experience and preference, I would take this over Grado SR60/80i/e or Koss porta pro/kph30 any day for its timbre and tuning even if it was the same price point.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the resolution or timbre isn’t gonna beat an HD6XX, and the build is quite cheap. But I find the build with its metal headband more sturdy than any of the Koss headphones that can even be triple the price. For a fun sounding Bluetooth headphones with 26 hour battery, lightweight and decent retro design AND built in app eq for around £20 is crazy. \n\nI’ve got too many headphones and have bought all the headphones mentioned in this review, but I will be keeping these around which is the biggest compliment I can give as I have given away/sold the all the Koss products. I’m no expert and have no intention to try over selling these but for anyone who’s considering a sub 100 open back Bluetooth headphones, these are the best in my experience!",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they’d be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can’t do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I’ve heard from a Sennheiser, it’s not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop… I know what you want me to say, but I don’t hate them. They’re definitely not the headphone I’m going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I’m hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro’s are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you’ve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I’d love to hear other’s perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I’ll get.",

    "selftext": "It’s been about a year since I bought the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones, and honestly… I’m done with Bose. The multipoint connection is just terrible.\n\nSometimes when I connect another device, the first one just disconnects for no reason. If I’m on a call and another device connects, it drops the call or randomly switches the audio back to my phone’s speakers — and then I can’t even get the sound back to Bluetooth unless I disconnect and reconnect the headphones.\n\nThe ear detection is also super inconsistent. Sometimes it pauses when I take them off, sometimes it keeps playing even when they’re around my neck. And other times, if I just tilt my head slightly, it pauses for no reason.\n\nBut the absolute worst part? Phone calls. Everyone I talk to keeps saying that they can hear all the background noise around me — sometimes even louder than my own voice. I honestly don’t understand how a company that’s supposed to be the world leader in noise cancellation can’t make headphones that handle calls properly.\n\nAnd to top it off, there’s this constant beep I get every 10 seconds when the connection to a device is lost. You can’t disable it, and it’s infuriating. It basically forces me to turn off multipoint altogether — which defeats the whole point of buying “premium” headphones that are supposed to handle multiple devices smoothly.\n\nI really wanted to love these, but between the connection issues, the unreliable ear detection, and the unusable mic for calls, I just can’t justify Bose anymore.",

    "title": "HDB 630 vs Px8 S2 (tried them both)",
    "selftext": "I decided I had to hear and feel both of these myself to make a decision. While I'm at it, thought I could share some non-professional impressions for people looking at these 2 headphones.\n\nI'm coming from a Px8, with EqualizerAPO's parametric EQ and Px8 profile (to make it sound more neutral) on Windows.\n\nBoth headphones tested with USB-C, no effects, no EQ, ANC off. I do find it quite hard to A/B test headphones, because when swapping them, every second longer it takes, the more you are leaning on memory. So I can't really tell every detail apart. But putting overall impressions together:\n\nThe Px8 S2 sounds warmer, and has more emphasis on lower frequencies. When there's deep bass in a song, the Px8 S2 will make that bass *deep*. It's not really out of balance, but you can hear it's tuned for people who like to have their music meaty. This does however mean that where's an emphasis on bass, this drowns out the midrange a bit (maybe overstating it a bit here, but you know what I mean). Higher frequencies are boosted a bit as well I believe. Over USB-C, the Px8 S2 can go a lot louder than the HDB 630.\n\nThe HDB 630 sounds balanced, maybe the uppermost frequencies could be a tiny bit smoothed. I'll have to see if that's just because i'm not used to it yet. Already noticing it less today. But the rest of the sound is just where it should be to my ears at least. And that's across genres without changing any settings as well. Pop, dance, rock, extreme metal (the latter which eats about 75% of my listening time). Don't be afraid for an absence of bass, it's there, just better controlled and there where it should be, without an over-emphasis.\n\nThere is no denying the Px8 S2 build quality is on another level. Everything is premium. Looking at comfort, the earpads feel stiffer/fuller and the headband has more clamp force, which makes them feel firmer in place. I think they are very comfortable, but I am used to the Px8 after 2 years so that factor does come into play here.\n\nThe HDB 630 is decent, but does not feel premium. Everything is plastic, and the earpads are very soft. They press in more easily than the Px8 S2. There is less clamp force, partly due to the headband, partly due to the softer earpads. They are a bit less firm in place, but they do feel lighter on the head and ears. I did notice my ears getting pretty hot from the HDB 630 yesterday after a long listening session, that may be the difference between real leather (Px8 S2) and vegan leather (HDB 630).\n\nThe earcups on the Px8 S2 are a bit wider and deeper and don't come into contact with my ears.\n\nWhen I put on the HDB 630, I notice that my ears (which aren't big) make an ever so slight contact on the inside of the headphone. Nothing I notice while listening though. I do find that I have to be more precise with placing the HDB 630 because of the narrow space in the earcup.\n\nLastly, the Px8 S2 has the USB-C connection on the left side, which could be an advantage when you're using it behind a computer and you're right-handed.\n\nI did not take into account apps, dongles and specs, that is something you can read and don't have to experience yourself, which can't be said about comfort and sound quality.\n\nConclusion: I really wish I could mash up these 2 headphones. The sound quality and perceived weight of the Sennheiser, with the premium build quality, materials and fit of the B&W. But my priority was to look for a more neutral headphone (out of the box sound), so the Sennheiser wins for me.",

Either it sounded dull, the UX was bad or I just plain didn't like using it.\n\nHaving tried mostly chinese stuff, I finally wanted to try something completly different and it paid off.\n\nMy recent purchase was the Lake People G101 a simple, anlog headphone amp. No balanced, no DSP, just a power putton, volume dial and headphone ports. I love it. This might sound silly, but I really enjoy having dedicated 3.5mm and 1/4inch ports so I never have to use an annoying adapter anymore.\n\nI rarely see products of this company anywhere online, so I wanted to share it with you all (although you might know them by their high-end brand \"Violectric\"). This costs 240€, is built like a tank and - something I also rarely see marketed about - is proud of the built-in headphone protection circuits. Let's hope I don't need them but it's nice to see thought given to that part of the device. Also designed and built in Germany for my fellow r/BuyFromEU volks.\n\nThe DAC on-top is a Topping D10s, one of the first HiFi products I got and it runs great too. What can I say: It's a DAC. Did an AB test with other DACs and couldn't tell a difference so they really don't matter in terms of sound (for me).\n\nIf I could change anything it would be the color of the DAC, both being black would be nice. But other than that I am so happy and juet feel peace with this setup. It sounds great, has lots of power and will hopefully last me a long time.",

However ALOT of problems have risen up Rn.\n\nThe audio sounds HORRIBLE! Its muffled, with me having to equalize the hell out of the headphone to sound the similar to my IEMs or the AKG K44. (I use the Onboard Motherboard sound card “gigabyte P110-D3” for more info) \neven then it screws my video/audio editing precision up,(volume control, General Equalization etc.) making me double check my videos twice with my IEMs. \n\nWhen I equalize it, i balance the bass but still give the cheap feeling  of when you listen to something with a bit of Bassy, the high and mids just go “low volume” mode. (Not sure that might be a sound card problem idk im new to the audio world)\n\nI was wondering if this is a fake headphone or not? And just general tips on what to do?\nThe headband just lost its stitches on its inner rubber and i had to stitch it myself (after 2 weeks of use btw).\nThe printing has some minor smudges on the font. As if they didnt paint it well, The cable feels nice tho and does not feel fake… but overall feels sketchy.\n\n(Im from iran and we dont have customer support here so i cant do anything but just look for tips here. Due to sanctions eveything is twice as expensive and banned here. Even buying stuff from amazon.)\n\nI’ve heared that if i buy a sound card (UE Volt 1) it will make it sound better, but im not sure… should it? Imean my brother’s K44 sounded amazing no matter what u plugged it into.\n\nSo what do i do?\n\nStart editing with my IEMs again?\nBuy the UE VOLT 1 sound card?\nGet a razor black shark V2X?\njust stop using the K72 entirely?\nI really dont know what to do tbh… ",

It was just very farty and anything close to normal volume made it sound extremely sad. I am not joking when I say this but an HD600 with a subbass shelf has cleaner bass. IT CANNOT DO SUBBASS EVEN STOCK.\n\nMids: actually not too bad, nothing to write home about. I honestly don't know what to say about it except for its mediocre and VERY IN YOUR FACE. Suicideboys was the only artist that sounded okay.\n\nHighs: OH BOY IT GETS WORSE, there is something real nasty goin on in the low-mid treble. This was something that could not be fixed with mods or whatever I did. Maybe it's a reflection or resonance from the driver cover? I tried everything in the book and I could not fix it.\nBut anyway, the treble wasn't fun. It was a hazy mess, any track sounded sharp and not detailed at the same time. I can accept being slightly piercing IF there is a good amount of detail output.\n\nThe baseline is that there are WAYYY better cans at the same price. I have also seen DMS recommending them and I can sort of understand why since his listening volume is extremely low (compared to mine) and doesn't run into the same distortion problems (I think).",

All over this sub, and other IEM subs have repeatedly said, \"If you can get it loud enough then you don't need an amp!\" LIES!\n\nI went to a headphone shop today, I brought my own dongle DAC/Amp. Tried a bunch of headphones. You know what? Yes I could get the demo units up to par listening volume. It was loud enough. Didn't even need to get to 80% volume for it to be loud. Huh, sounds decent.\n\nThen the guy said to try it with a dedicated desktop amp. I plugged it in, and lo' and behold, the audio is richer, soundstage is bigger, the headphones came ALIVE. Before, it was tinny and flat, but loud enough. Crazily, with the amp, the volume was actually set lower. Did I volume match? No, but I didn't need to because I could hear the difference before I got to the same volume. \n\nI always turn the volume down to zero before swapping anything. Before I even got halfway there to the same volume, I could already hear how much richer the sound was.\n\nFYI, it was a Samsung S22 Ultra -> Luxury & Precision W4 -> 4.4mm Out, this was the dongle DAC setup that actually sounds quite phenomenal for IEMs, but with headphones the W4 simply could not produce enough juice to *really drive* the headphones (HiFiMAN Edition XS). \n\nSo, do you need an amp if you are using headphones?

More affordable than an equally powerful amp from Stax, and nice to have something hand-made in Germany, but it could really be a bit smaller.\n\nI got the Little Dot MK2 on a whim last year and very occasionally use it with my HD800. My impression is that it does something pleasing to the staging and shaves off most of the micro details, which can be relaxing depending on the mood and music. Despite recommendations it is  not good with the HD580 which, to me, already lacks resolution. Need to set up an A/B comparison one of these days to see if I am just imagining things. \n\nHeadphones are Stax Lambda Nova Basic, which I got for cheap with one of the utter crap Stay entry level amps.",

    "selftext": "**Hello Community!**\n\nI hope you are having a good day. Today I have an IEM ready to be reviewed, which has been accompanying me for many days, and I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is the **Neko** model from the brand **CVJ.**\n\nAs in every review, I present to you my **sources:**\n\n* FiiO K11 for gaming on the main PC.\n* FiiO KA13 while working.\n* FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n* FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n* FiiO KA11.\n* FiiO JA11.\n* MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n* Shanling M0 Pro.\n* Amazon Music Ultimate.\n* Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you do not want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons**:\n\n**Pros**  \n→ Friendly, do not fatigue.  \n→ Punchy bass.  \n→ Delicious female vocals.  \n→ Soundstage above average.  \n→ No lack of detail in the high region.\n\n**Cons**  \n→ DAC/AMP recommended to get 100%.  \n→ If you are a purist, stay away.  \n→ Mids somewhat soft.  \n→ Lack of clarity in dense mixes.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis monitor set has been provided by the brand **CVJ**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be able to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions have been imposed when writing this review.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity that comes with analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and I develop it based on my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please, feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is my second contact with the brand. I was truly fascinated by the Vivian for being extremely fun in the low region.\n\nRegarding this model, I knew practically nothing because **CVJ** is not a brand that is widely seen around. In fact, this model does not even have a listing on Head-Fi, which I will try to create.\n\nGiven its price proximity (**30€/ $**) to the **Vivian**, I expected an evolution, a “more and better.”\n\nHas **CVJ Neko achieved that?**\n\n**About the contents:**\n\n* It is presented in a small square **box**, very eye-catching due to the waifu on the cover.\n* If we open it, we find the two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy, with vents to release internal pressure. Its construction is correct and robust.\n* A set of **ear tips** in sizes S, M, L.\n* A waifu **keychain**.\n* An optional **4.4mm plug**.\n* The **cable** with 0.78mm two-pin connections on the earphones, made of copper with silver plating and pre-installed 3.5mm connector. It is coated with non-rubbery plastic and the ends are metal.\n* User **manual.**\n\nThis is very good, but did you find them **comfortable?**\n\nYes, but with nuances. It should be emphasized that they are large. Not to the level of the **'whales'**, but they are neither small nor medium. And they are heavy, indeed very heavy.\n\nDoes that bother? Really no. Maybe my tolerance threshold is higher than other people, but I did not feel uncomfortable with them while sitting at the desk and walking on the street listening to music.\n\nI really liked the cable; it feels like a product of a higher range. It is robust but flexible at the same time, and I did not suffer a single tangle. The slider is functional.\n\nWith the ear tips, although they made a good seal, they are not of very good quality because they do not flex properly. I do not expect something Premium in this price range either.\n\nEven so, I was able to complete my listening sessions and enjoy them without major problems.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n* One dynamic driver (**1DD**) of black gold compound (?)\n* Sensitivity **114 dB**.\n* Impedance **26 ohms.**\n* Frequency range **20 Hz** to **20 kHz**.\n\nThe **CVJ Neko** could be used directly from the 3.5/4.4mm jack connection. However, my best sensations when analyzing them were with my more neutral sources, helping to better control the bass, applying more resolution to the sub-bass and softening without losing information in the high-frequency region. But I must recognize that I enjoyed more with warmer amplification, filling the low and mid regions with body at the cost of losing a little resolution up top.\n\n**Sound signature:**  \n**Neko** is tuned seeking energy in the low and high regions, drawing what I consider a soft V-shaped signature, with somewhat relaxed mids but not absent.\n\n**Sub-bass:** present but not exaggerated, providing a sense of depth with a boomy touch that I like, well-detailed and with just the right extension to enrich the listening experience.\n\n**Bass:** this is where **CVJ Neko** shines the most, adding warmth and body to your music. Not analytical but oriented to enjoyment with its impactful punch and prominent presence. I might miss a bit more control, but... in a way, I like it this way even though I have to point it out.\n\n**Low mids:** here the IEM also does a very good job that, without masking the central mids, has enough body to encourage instrumentation with more presence. Low-frequency transients are accurate. The sensation I get is that it does not muddy the listening.\n\n**Mids:** somewhat recessed, although they do not lose presence in the mix despite being very soft. In very vocal music, despite losing prominence, they still show resolution and texture.\n\n**Upper mids:** maintain clarity and presence in a way uncommon for its range, with great attack between instruments but without being aggressive. Enjoyment predominates above all in these Nekos, although sometimes it flirts with brightness.\n\n**Treble:** with some air or separation, it maintains good detail although in some recordings it can sting the ears slightly but not strongly or painfully. The result is a really detailed, pleasant, and non-fatiguing listening experience thanks to its pleasant warm signature.\n\n**Very deep male vocals:** substantial, with great weight and body, very revealing in their naturalness and articulation, although in denser mixes they may lose some prominence.\n\n**Normal male vocals:** too musical and aiming to please despite losing body, feeling a bit thin and distant from the stage. However, this lack of forward positioning does not prevent them from being enjoyable.\n\n**Female vocals:** I must applaud the results obtained. I am convinced by these monitors for their clarity and pleasant brightness, adding emotion, perceiving a very natural timbre rich in nuances and detail. Very good work.\n\n**Soundstage:** at a very interesting intermediate point; laterally you notice it escapes from your head and frontally maintains adequate and coherent distance. The height, what we feel above us, is not very remarkable, I would say average, perhaps slightly above.\n\n**Imaging:** placement is correct, not memorable but interpretable; the position of elements on stage is understandable and layering helps a lot, handling overlapping elements very satisfactorily if we do not demand from the **CVJ Neko** complicated situations with very dense tracks, where it stays slightly above the limit between chaotic and enjoyable.\n\n**Detail retrieval:** keeps up, though struggles a little. Even with less dense tracks, I feel a slight lack of speed between instruments, and subtle microdetails can escape.\n\n**Single-player gaming performance:**\n\nI encourage you to check the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always seeking the most cinematic experience possible, as well as the scenes I refer to in the video game examples. [Link.](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\n* **Red Dead Redemption 2:** could behave very clearly to represent voices accurately in depth and the dynamic blizzard, noticing a very realistic enveloping sensation.\n* **God of War Ragnarok:** testing bass, sub-bass, and very deep male vocals; as expected given Neko’s character, the experience was unbeatable for its price range. Reverb was pleasantly surprising for its prominence. Rumble, although explosive and strong, did not overshadow other sounds, and Kratos’ voice was natural, deep, and detailed.\n* **Doom:** testing how it handles dense mixes with many sounds at once… I can say it survived. I could perceive the different layers sufficiently to avoid a rough, resonant, and incoherent sound mass.\n* **A Plague Tale Requiem:** dialogue with female, child, and teenage voices was highly enjoyable. I cannot note lack of naturalness, timbre, or resolution in any voices.\n* **Same game, measuring voice and footsteps positioning of hidden characters:** not the most revealing experience, but **Neko** passes with a sufficient grade.\n* **Resident Evil 7 immersion test:** paying attention to environmental subtleties, very satisfactory sensations; distant noises, footsteps, and weather conditions were represented with accuracy, precision, and realism.\n* **Extreme sibilance test in Final Fantasy XVI during combat:** I did notice some sting in my eardrums, having to lower the volume. But, as I always say, this is a tremendously demanding test, and outside of it, it’s unlikely you find anything similar.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\n**CVJ Neko** is made for enjoyment; it is obvious they avoid the analytical approach. It has that “I’m going to make you have fun” vibe from the start.\n\n* Its bass develops very satisfactorily, adding extra emotion to songs that feature it well, although personally I prefer it slightly more controlled and defined. I consider that with better sources than mine, it could have achieved better results.\n* The midrange is pleasing, although not with all the desired energy, favoring instrumentation over vocals, but this does not prevent vocals from feeling natural and articulated.\n* Personally, besides the low region, the treble convinced me a lot: airy, defined, slightly elevated brightness, but without overdoing it, providing enough information to define this IEM as detailed.\n\nI could recommend this set for rock and electronic music, and if it includes female vocals, the enjoyment is total.\n\nIn gaming, for dialogue, I cannot ask for more, and immersion achieved thanks to the subtle representation of environmental microdetail was correct and pleasant, as were action scenes and open soundscapes. Definitely an option to consider.\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. You can read all my reviews [here.](https://short.do/59Zz9G)\n\n**See you** in the next review.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/hzhh291a74yf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1330b369663156fd2593bc89c456bd2a8ca3e1fb\n\nHi everyone:\n\nI used both the QCC Pro and BTD700 dongles to test various codecs (aptX, aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC) and noticed some distortion in the high frequencies—especially with piano tracks. This makes me suspect that my iPhone 17 Pro might have a defect in its audio chip or a related component. When I played the same songs on my older iPhone 13 Pro using AAC, there was no distortion. Unfortunately, I don’t have a Lightning dongle, so I couldn’t test aptX on the older phone. And also I have dropout problem when using both dongle.Does anyone else with an iPhone 17 series notice these issues?\n\nMy personal experience with these three little friends:\n\nYou really can’t go wrong with either dongle.\n\nQCC Pro\n\nHas its own app with a much better UX design. The slim form factor fits perfectly on a phone or tablet. Looks more premium in person (the photos make it seem cheaper than it is). Comes with only one dongle — I originally thought there were two (one for the phone and one for the headphones that communicate directly), which would’ve justified the higher price over the BTD700. The packaging design is a bit misleading.\n\nBTD700\n\nWorks great for home or office use.Doesn’t have a mobile app, but there’s one for PC/Mac. Sadly, I couldn’t update the firmware no matter what system I used. But it works. One simple button does everything you need.\n\nIn terms of sound, they’re very similar. I can only tell the difference when comparing side by side — the QCC Pro’s mids are slightly louder and more forward.\n\nIf you like the QCC Pro’s design but prefer the BTD700’s price, check out the QCC Standard (white) version. I believe only Bloom Audio carries it, and they’re an awesome retailer. Please remember, Only QCC PRO Has LDAC.\n\nAbout the PX8 S2\n\nThey’re extremely comfortable. My head circumference is about 21.5\", and I’m very sensitive — even picky — about anything pressing on my head (I can’t stand most beanies). But I can wear the PX8 S2 for long sessions with no problem. My old XM3s and AirPods Max felt like Jigsaw’s traps in comparison.\n\nThe leather is incredibly soft — genuinely reminiscent of Hermès leather. If you or your HAPPY WIFE have Hermès bags, you’ll know what I mean.\n\nAs for sound quality, the PX8 S2 really shines with large-scale or orchestral music. That doesn’t mean they’re not good for solo performances — I love listening to Yo-Yo Ma with them. For pop music, it’s more about personal preference. The sound is very balanced — I like it a lot, but as I like to say, I like drinking water… and you might not.\n\n\\*I use gpt to make my post more readable and I also post this review on B&W subreddit. Any advice or question are welcome\n\n",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2flmc5e914yf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=70db2ea529ba5f5b1230ac28b4d91c7ec2cfedce\n\nSo, I want to talk about DACs. Personally, I’m not a believer in all that snake oil — people saying cables or fancy chargers magically make your sound better. I don’t buy it. And honestly, I don’t think a modern DAC really should change the sound either.  I’ve always thought that if there’s any difference, it’s basically EQ on the hardware level. I do EQs all the time — I know you can open up the soundstage or change the feel just by tweaking certain frequencies. So when people say an amp gives them a “bigger soundstage,” I just assume it’s because some frequencies are boosted.\n\nThat said, I’m open-minded — I’ll try things myself. I compared the **FiiO K11 and K7**, and honestly, I hear *no* difference. The only thing I might notice is a slight change in volume, but once that’s matched, everything else — bass, mids, treble, soundstage, imaging — sounds identical.\n\nSo if a reviewer claims they can hear big differences between the two, I’m out. Either they’re trying to sell something, or they just have superhuman ears that I don’t. In either case, their opinions don’t mean much to me anymore, because I can’t hear what they hear.\n\nAlright, let’s talk about the **K13** and **K7**, okay?\n\nWhen I first plugged in the K13, I *did* notice something different. I couldn’t tell exactly what at first, but it didn’t feel like my imagination. After more testing — switching headphones, replaying the same tracks — I realized the K13 really does sound different, and not in a way I can easily EQ out.\n\nThe **vocals** on the K13 feel more emotional, more *chesty*. They resonate in your head — especially those higher notes — in a way the K7 doesn’t. By emotional, I mean it makes me feel more emotions from the singer. I expected an R2R DAC to cut off some treble and make things sound dull, and that’s somewhat true: the K13 does smooth out harsh or sibilant sounds. But instead of sounding flat, it makes vocals richer and more engaging.\n\nIt also makes the piano and guitar sound \"heavier\". (more weight? not very familiar with these terms)\n\nWhen it comes to **imaging**, the K13 feels more *focused*. With the K7, I can tell where the singer is, but with the K13, it’s like their voice locks into one spot — more defined, more solid in space.\n\nNow, about the **soundstage** — and I can’t believe I’m saying this — it really does push everything away from you. This is especially noticeable with the **FiiO FT1 Pro**, which normally has a super narrow stage from left to right, with vocals sitting right by your ears. But with the K13, those vocals move forward quite a bit, now they sit in front of you instead of besides you — same with the instruments. Everything feels pushed a bit out in front of you.\n\nThat’s not always a good thing. One thing I like about the FT1 Pro is that intimate vocal presentation on some tracks, like the singer’s right next to your ear. The K13 kind of takes that away. So it depends on the track and personal taste — some benefit from that extra space, some don’t. But objectively, yes, the K13 pushes the sound a little farther from you.\n\nNow, about the **two modes** — *oversampling* and *non-oversampling*.  \nThe difference isn’t huge, but it’s there.\n\n* **Oversampling mode**: has more treble and clarity. It’s actually brighter than I expected for an R2R DAC. Some sibilance still remains, but it’s slightly tamed.\n* **Non-oversampling mode**: smoother, less sharp, less “exciting.” The treble rolls off more, which makes it sound softer but also less clear. Personally, I find it a bit boring, but I can see why some people prefer it.\n\nSo yeah — I originally thought about returning it, but after spending time with it, I decided to keep it. It’s pricey, and there’s no discount right now, but as someone who listens mainly to vocals, I just love how expressive and emotional they sound through the K13.\n\nJust to be clear, they are not going to fix your headphones in any way. the change it makes is not that big, but it is those small things that, once you notice, you can't ignore. Same reason why people would spend thousands on headphones.\n\nThat’s my honest take.",

In some ways, they resemble the HE1000SE, though their soundstage feels much smaller compared to both the Sundara and the HEKSE.

    "title": "Suggestion for next best headphone? Moving on from JBL.",
    "selftext": "So I previously had upgraded from some generic brand headphones to the JBL Quantum One's. They blew me away - I hadn't been expecting an actual increase in audio quality, just that they'd be more comfortable to wear, but they were noticeably better on audio quality, by what seemed like a significant amount.\n\nMore recently (a few months ago) my first set got to the point that I decided it was time for a replacement set. That one had connectivity issues straight out of the box: every time I'd move or turn my head *even slightly*, the connection would quit and I'd have to unplug and re-plug them in again.\n\nEventually I got tired of this and bought a *third* set. Which also, immediately out of the box, gave me the same issue. I switched the wires I was using - since each set came with it's own - but the problem persisted.\n\nAt this point, I'm just beyond done fiddling with these obscene excuses of technology and want to find something I won't have to worry about replacing multiple times to get a functioning set from.",

    "title": "Advice for the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs 80ohm Headphones",
    "selftext": "Hello, I recently bought the DT 770 Pros 80ohm as I've been looking for a upgrade from my old logitech g433 headphones. After doing a days research i concluded that these dt 770 pros headphones had a lot of praise from many different sources and highly rated as great headphones.\n\nJust to make clear i'm no audio expert or anything, im a complete newb when it comes to this. But I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and gaming.\n\nI understand these are made for studio purposes but I've seen many people use and say they're just as good for gaming. Anyway, It's been a week of using them for about 5 hours daily, and I'm quite disappointed in a couple things.\n\n1. The clamp force is quite something, I'm no softy but when i first got them i just expected it to be that way because they were new, but after a week of consistent use, my head and ears have a burning affect from the ear muffs clamping down. Which really confuses me because of the amount of praise for comfort I saw online.\n\n2, The audio quality is a little underwhelming, I got the 80ohms version and I was under the impression that higher tier motherboards could power them no problem. After using them for a week i've noticed they sound a bit flat compared to my ancient old logitech g433's, I know they're not the same type of headphones but i dont understand why people prefer flat audio compared to more punchy \"feeling\" audio. Anyway I found the Equalizer APO + peace eq program and started fiddling with EQ and even used some highly creditable EQ presets made for these exact headphones, but i found myself continously reverting back to the default EQ. It gets a bit confusing because I found that when you tweak EQ, it raises the db naturally, and you have to adjust the pre amp in the minus direction to compensate to avoid distortion, in saying that i'm not sure if i just preferred the default eq simply because it was louder compared to the quiter adjusted eq presets, in that case im lost.\n\n3. This is just preference but after speaking to some friends over discord, I could barely hear myself talk which made it feel very unnatural to talk. I tried enabling the \"listen to this device\" on my mic and it didnt help much. Just wondering how singers / voice actors deal with it.\n\nAfter continously comparing these DT 770 pros to my G433's, I can't say im blown away with the 770's audio unfortunately. And so i'm really wondering if one of those little amp/dac devices would really make all the difference? or barely any. I really wanted these to work but i've got a quote to refund them within a couple days and it's quite a sad feeling.\n\nSo I'd appreciate any advice or experiences on these headphones and my situation, whether it gets more comfortable and or if the sound quality will really become better with a little amp/dac such as the Fosi Audio Q4 on amazon or whether I should just let them go.\n\nThanks for reading",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I don't talk on here very often but I had been searching for headphones after my last pair which lasted me about 13 years (Sennheiser HD598's) and still worked fine.\n\nI settled on the Aune AR5000's because they fit my pricepoint. I got them, EQ'd them and fell in love with that nice creamy bass.\n\nThat was exactly 14 months ago. For my usage I babied them, was always gentle despite the feeling of sturdy construction, and adored them. Never dropped.\n\nI have a small'ish to medium head. When I would use my pc I would simply pick them up and put them on like any other headphone.\n\nToday I wake up and the absolute weirdest thing happen, I went to put them on but they weren't... feeling right, I checked and YEP, they had cracked from soft usage after a year. I had seen other users with the pin for the ear support coming out because it was plastic but thought it would never happen to me because I'm so gentle with them.\n\nI have emailed my retailer and aune to see what they say but I'm pretty sure I'm SOL.\n\nMy advice? DO NOT BUY. This isn't a quality control problem, its a design and fundamental flaw in having that section made from plastic.\n\nI'm livid and now have to go searching for new headphones AGAIN.\n\n\n\nEDIT: If aune refuse to help I will investigate the replacement bands, or just outright upgrade to a pair of Meze 105's\n\nThese headphones were great for gaming and music and I feel the 105's have a better looking construction.\n\nAlso after plugging my over decade old HD598's they sound almost as good as the Aune AR5000's. So I think my over-enthusiasm for their sound might have been for reasons I can't explain. These are 90% the headphone sound of them and considering the age of them, that's hilarious.",

Whether it's the desk fan, the compressor on my fridge, or the ambient noises of a commuter train. Meanwhile, the Bose blocks almost everything to the point of near-silence.\n\nOn a flight, I'd say they're near equal, but the Bose comes out ahead for consistency.\n\n*Winner: Bose*\n\n**Comfort:**\n\nHighly subjective but the XM5s just fit in my ear better, despite a smoother exterior profile. The Bose have a rubber ridge that's meant to more snugly rest on your inner ear, but when I smile/laugh or brush my teeth, the Bose have a tendency to wriggle themselves loose. They've never fallen out entirely, but I'd need to readjust them.\n\n*Winner: Sony*\n\n**Sound Quality:**\n\nBose hands down. The XM5s midrange sounds way too hollow, and compared to my other headphones and IEMs, even the headphone XM5s, it makes listening to my music unpleasant.\n\nWinner: Bose\n\n**Charging Case:**\n\nSony's charging case stands up tall, so you can open the case while it's resting on a table surface. Meanwhile, the Bose case lays flat on its back, so you need to pick it up to open it. It also takes up more desk space.\n\nHowever, that means that the Sony charging case holds roughly 50-60% (in my experience) the charge of the Bose's case.\n\n*Winner: No clear winner here. I don't mind having a smaller charge in return for a smaller case.*\n\n**Default User Experience**\n\nWhen you put on the Sony, there is a gentle boop sound when it's connected to your devices, and a quiet voice reminder when the battery gets too low.\n\nOn the Bose, when the earphones start up, it proceeds to play basically the THX logo sound directly into your ears every single time. Then when it connects to a device, the robotic AI voice says the device name every time, even if the device name is really long. If you have multiple devices you need to wait to play whatever you were trying to listen to. I promptly disabled voice prompts but it still talks when I switch audio modes. Whose stupid idea was this.\n\nWinner: Sony\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFor most people, I'd recommend the XM5s despite the annoying adaptive ANC feature and audio quality, since using it is overall just less abrasive on a day to day basis.\n\nBut if you want more charge out of your case, and your ambient environment is consistently noisy, get the Bose and just never worry about background noise ever again.",

The LCD-4 is already smooth in the treble and could use some added bite and incisiveness there.\n\nAnother area of concern is potentially shallow stage depth, a common complaint with their NFCA amp tech. I love the power output specs and\nPEQ is a really nice addition though.\n\n\n[Cayin iH8-A]\n\nSuper powerful true class A, amp only. Has a hyper bottom that supercharges the sound to become more dynamic and incisive. \n\n\n\nThe question really here is: does the LCD-4 in particular benefit from powerful class A or a more analytically leaning yet powerful NFCA Topping amp? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Arya Organic…Wow",
    "selftext": "My thoughts on the Arya Organics (I know there’s plenty of reviews etc, but what harm can another do)\n\nI jumped into this hobby about 2 years ago roughly. Through that time, I’ve been through plenty headphones, but the only ones I spent a LOT of time with was 2. The Arya Stealth, and the HD560s. \n\n(Skip further down if you don’t care about the previous stories)\n\nThe Stealths were mind blowing to me, I did have planars before these. The edition xs (felt way too cheap for the 300 mark at the time. The Ananda Nanos (clamped like a vice). So picked up the Arya Stealths for £710, which was their cheapest price at the time. I owned these for 6 months. Every time I put them on, I was astounded at the sound. However, after 2 months, I rarely used them, I didn’t have the time to listen, and didn’t want £700 lying around. So I reluctantly sold them, and decided to pick up the cheaper pair, the HD560s. So I could still enjoy music, without feeling guilty having some premium set collecting dust. And these were fine, for £90, they were great.\n\nRecently however I’m now in a position where I have a lot more free time, and for that reason, I wanted to pick up a higher end headphone again. I was debating between many, but in the end it kept boiling down to the Stealths, which were now £460. But then saw the Organics were just £120 extra as “open-box” from Hifiman. One thing I absolutely hated with the Stealths was how harsh some of the treble was, and at the time I didn’t have EQ. So I was stuck with harsh treble in a few songs I enjoyed other times. Between owning the 560s and Stealths, I did pick up the JDS Element 4 Dac/Amp in preparation for higher end cans in the future, and to play around with EQ. So hearing the Organics had a harsh treble, it didn’t really deter me as I had the capabilities to town it down.\n\nSo now onto the Organics…\n\nLOOKS:\nThese things are absolutely gorgeous! It’s like taking your grandads beautifully varnished wooden table and chairs, and adding a modern touch to it. It makes them stand out and look far more premium than the price suggests (I’m aware they were 1500 odd on release, but on current pricing, the point stands). They feel more premium for this matter. I the one massive negative, is you have to wear them to listen, meaning I can’t just stare at them when in use. \n\nCOMFORT:\nAnyone who’s familiar with the Arya lineup, know that this line of headphones are on the comfier side of the Hifiman brand. They clamp just enough to not feel loose, but not too hard that it feels like the hulk is crushing your skull (Nanos). Yes the pads aren’t the most comfy pads on any headphone, they’re actually the one aspect I don’t like. They don’t feel premium, and the fabric design sometimes catches the odd strand of hair which isn’t pleasant. However changing these means altering the sound, which you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, want to do. The headband is perfect though. Suspended straps are my favourite on headphones, adds a premium feel, look and feels like far less pressure on your head. Not to mention how wide they are, it helps distribute the weight so well.\n\nUNBOXING: \nDead, £5 unboxing experience, but realistically who cares…\n\nSOUND:\nGrand. Exciting. Smooth. \n\nThe 3 words I’d use to describe the sound. Which goes to show how versatile they are. They give off such a ‘grand’ feeling, when you listen to orchestral pieces, it feels like you’re in a theatre listening to a band playing, but like you’re middle row. Not first row where it feels in your face, and not back row that it feels like it’s far away. It’s that perfect middle ground where it’s around you, but so that you can hear everything so cleanly. They’re exciting in the sense that after an orchestral piece, you put on an EDM track, pop or anything in that region, and it feels like you want to get up and just dance, but don’t, as these probably would fall off your head. And then you go for a very vocal focused piece of music, and the smoothness of the voice just glides through your ears. There’s no moment where it’s aggressive (unless it needs to be) or where it holds back. It’s like an electric supercar. You put your foot down, and it picks up straight away, but with no aggression, just picks up and gets going right away. \n\nOnto the specifics:\n\nBASS - Very solid. Definitely stronger than the Arya Stealths. When I had them, the bass was there, but it needed a tad more punch. These add that very subtle punch, where you know it’s bass, but it doesn’t slip into the other frequencies and overthrow them. It’s controlled VERY well. The sub bass is fantastic too. My favourite song to test this is “The Droid Invasion and the Appearance of Darth Maul” from The Phantom Menace. The drums at the start provide that sub bass test and it really shows how it handles it well. Doesn’t get fatiguing, just presents it so smoothly. Not to mention how clear the drums sound, like you can visualise the fabric drum stick hitting against the massive drum. The bass is also quick when needing to be. In many pop songs where there is the common use of bass, or in rap music, it’ll show the bass, and stop it perfectly. It never feels like it over presents itself. They also hold the bass off so well from overpowering the mids. Many headphones either make the bass so minimal that you don’t realise there should be bass, and many push it so hard it dims down the vocals. These control it so so well.\n\nMIDS - I would say the weakest out of the Low, Mid and High ends. Definitely NOT bad, it’s really really great. However when there is consistent bass present, and a lot of higher end or many many instruments playing, the vocals definitely take a seat back. They’re still very clear, but it pushes the instruments forward a bit more. Which isn’t bad at all, and some people may prefer this. It’s more of a preference thing. I certainly don’t mind it, and it’s not something I’m gonna be quickly to go and EQ, but if I was, it’s the first thing I’d play with, just to bring them forward a touch. BUT, when there’s only a low end and vocals, or high end and vocals, they are stunning. They just sound so real and ‘organic’, it’s like having a conversation with David Attenborough, just so nicely spoken and a voice you wish could commentate on your whole life. \n\nHIGHS - Lies were told here, or obviously it’s just down to personal hearing. But these are NOT ‘peaky’ or ‘harsh’. The high end is so well controlled. With the Arya Stealth, I absolutely could not listen to Nightcall - Kavinsky from Drive. The chorus of the song was so harsh I literally couldn’t listen to it. So the first song I wanted to try was that, and on these I could listen to the entire song with no issues. They have just enough brightness to make everything sound clean and clear, but not too much that it comes across as piercing during songs. Same with Time - Pink Floyd. The start with all the clocks can be very piercing with poorly controlled highs, but it’s like the headphones actively know it’s going to sound harsh and presents them just a tone down so that you don’t have to turn the volume down or skip forward. It was my one worry with these, and although EQ is an option, I did want to enjoy them stock for as long as possible. Which I’m ecstatic with the fact I can.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE - Wide, but not artificially wide, just naturally wide. Like I said with the orchestral hall and being “grand”. It just sounds so perfectly deep. It’s not like the sound is coming from across the room, but it’s not like the song is being played right next to you. It’s similar to car speakers, in the way it’s all round you, but not as if you’re listening to the persons car next to you. It’s intimate enough that you feel like it’s YOUR music, not someone else’s near you, but also distant enough that it’s like it’s your own personal concert. \n\nSEPARATION - Always tough because if a song is produced badly, even the greatest ever headphones won’t be able to separate the parts. But in a well produced track, you can actively hear each and every instrument and voice. In “Call it what you want” by Taylor Swift, there’s many instances where there are backing vocals playing over Taylor, and you can hear each one clearly, but as if they’re actually behind her. Like Taylor’s singing into your ear, whilst the backing singer is sat 2 foot behind her also singing, but you can clearly tell one is the main, one is the backing. The 560s definitely struggled with this, you often couldn’t hear the multiple voices, so now listening to many songs, I’m hearing voices I didn’t realise were there (I actually checked on 2 occasions that I wasn’t listening to a remix).\n\nConclusion:\nYes. Just yes. Stellar\n\nSetup I’m using:\nHifiman Arya Organic -> JDS Element 4 -> MacBook M3 -> Audirvana (because Tidal is buggy as anything on Mac since iOS 26 and Apple Music doesn’t auto change the Sample Rate) \n",

    "title": "A New Study on the Equivalence of Harman OE Target on Modern Test Fixtures, Co-authored by Sean Olive and Dan Clark Audio",
    "selftext": "> Summarized by Qwen.\n\nFor years, the *Harman target*—a frequency response profile derived from extensive double-blind listening tests—has served as a benchmark for “neutral” or preferred headphone sound. Originally defined using a specific GRAS 45CA test fixture equipped with a custom “Welti” pinna and an RA045 (Type 3.3) ear simulator, this target has become widely referenced in both research and product development.\n\nHowever, a critical issue has emerged: many modern labs and manufacturers now use newer test fixtures—such as the **GRAS 45CA-10** (with KB5000 anthropomorphic pinna and RA0402 ear simulator) and the **Brüel & Kjær Type 5128** (featuring a Type 4.3 ear simulator compliant with ITU-T P.57). These fixtures differ acoustically from the original Harman setup, particularly in their **acoustic transfer impedance**, especially below 500 Hz and above 3 kHz. Applying the original Harman target directly to measurements from these newer systems can lead to misinterpretation—and potentially misguided tuning decisions.\n\nIn a new paper presented at the **AES 159th Convention** (October 2025), **Sean Olive** (the architect of the Harman target) and **Dan Clark** address this problem head-on. Their work defines *Harman-equivalent targets* specifically calibrated for the GRAS 45CA-10 and B&K 5128 fixtures, ensuring that headphones tuned to these revised targets will sound subjectively similar to those tuned to the original Harman reference.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe authors measured seven diverse headphones including open-back and closed-back models from Dan Clark Audio, HiFiMan, and Sennheiser—on all three fixtures (original Welti, GRAS 45CA-10, and B&K 5128). Using a straightforward calibration method in Room EQ Wizard (REW), they derived fixture-specific targets by:\n\n1. Measuring each headphone on both the original and new fixtures.\n2. Computing the ratio between responses (e.g., KB5000 / Welti).\n3. Applying this ratio to the original Harman target (phase-conjugated and smoothed) to generate a new, equivalent target.\n\nThis process accounts for the unique acoustic loading and leakage characteristics of each fixture.\n\n## Listening Tests Confirm Validity\n\nTo validate the approach, the team conducted controlled **MUSHRA-style listening tests** with 13 experienced listeners, comparing seven versions of the target:\n\n- The original Harman target (Reference)\n- Fixture-specific targets calibrated per headphone\n- Targets averaged across 7 or 20 headphones\n\nResults were clear: when headphones were equalized to their **fixture-specific, individually calibrated targets**, they sounded **nearly identical** to the original Harman reference. In statistical terms, the **B&K 5128** and **GRAS 45CA-10** targets (calibrated per model) were **not significantly different** from the reference in perceived similarity.\n\nBy contrast, targets derived from **averages across multiple headphones** (e.g., “5128_20”) scored lower—though still within the “very similar” range—highlighting that **individual calibration yields the best match**.\n\nInterestingly, the type of headphone (open vs. closed-back) had minimal impact on results, suggesting the method is robust across designs.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nFor engineers and audiophiles alike, this work resolves a long-standing ambiguity: **you cannot directly apply the classic Harman target to measurements taken on modern fixtures** and expect accurate tuning. Instead, fixture-specific equivalents are needed.\n\nEncouragingly, the differences between targets are often correctable with **simple bass and treble shelving filters**, as most deviations occur in well-defined frequency regions. This opens the door for more consistent, cross-platform headphone evaluation—and more reliable interpretations of published measurements.\n\nWhile the study focused on seven models, the calibration framework is generalizable. Future work may yield standardized correction targets for common fixtures, enabling broader adoption without per-headphone measurement.\n\n## Reference\n\nOlive, S., & Clark, D.

    "title": "Flux FA-10: Brutal Power, \"Nervous\" Character",
    "selftext": "​I was looking for a powerful and clean-sounding Solid State (SS) amplifier for my HE6se V2 headphones when I stumbled upon this Flux FA-10 on sale for €350 shipped. So, I pulled the trigger. Now I'm here with this Class A \"beast,\" capable of delivering a staggering 16W into 32 ohms (10.5W into 64 ohms).\n​Overall, the sound was... adequate. But let me unpack this a little bit further.\n\n\n**​An Aggressive Presentation**\n\n​I don't want to complain about the cleanliness and detail this unit brings to the table on some (though not all) of my headphones, but I genuinely dislike its aggressive and 'in your face' presentation. \nIt sounds tense, like a nervous person trying to tell a fairy tale to a child. Granted, I'm coming from tube amps like my Eufonika OTL, or the relaxed sound of the Mojo 2, but... I wasn't expecting this kind of house sound from Flux.\nI usually associate Class A with a slightly warm character and a rolled-off treble, which this device is definitively not.\n\n\n**​Lack of Dynamics on Elex and HE6**\n\n​The HE6 and the Elex are among the most punchy and dynamic headphones on the market. The Elex can sound punchy even if connected to a [potato](https://www.instructables.com/Potato-Battery-Understanding-Chemical-and-Electric/), and the HE6 demands significant power to fully express its dynamic nature.\nNevertheless, with the FA-10, both headphones sound unimpressive dynamically, especially the Elex, which really surprised me.\nI usually plug them into an Aliexpress dongle or the Chord Mojo 2 and am always satisfied with the bass impact.\n​The Elex's punchiness seems irrecoverable even with EQ, which only introduces mud into the sound. The HE6, however, can regain some of its impact through equalization.\n\n\n***​Note***: It is important not to confuse the role of EQ. It can add bass quantity, but the violence of the attack of a bass note is what dictates its physical impact. This is a physical characteristic that does not solely relate to the Frequency Response (FR). For example, the FiiO FT1 has much more bass than the Elex, but it sounds way less punchy.\n\n​The Elex sounds somewhat muddy and poorly controlled compared to the Mojo 2, while the HE6 sounds largely as its graph suggests.\n\n\n**Decent ​Synergy with the HD660S2**\n\n​The Sennheiser HD660S2 has a very relaxed sound signature (with some sparkle around 6-8kHz). They actually sound good with this amp because it balances their chill presentation, occasionally making them sound aggressive too.\n\n\n**​Strengths Worth Highlighting**\n\n​Despite my criticisms, I want to highlight the amp's strengths:\n- ​Incredible Power: It runs my HE6se V2 on low gain, using only 3/4 of the volume knob.\n- ​Pristine Cleanliness and Detail: The sound is dead clean and highly detailed.\n- ​Stage and Separation: The stage is a decent, medium size, and the imaging and instrumental separation are top-notch for the price.\n- Flexible Inputs: It accepts balanced inputs, but since it's a pure single-ended device, both the SE and balanced outputs should sound virtually the same. This is a great feature, making the FA-10 more flexible regarding the source you feed it.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n​Ultimately, I would never recommend this amp to people sensitive to the 3-4kHz region like myself. This amplifier is a cannon for those frequencies (from a presentation standpoint). If you have a warm and relaxed headphone, it can truly wake it up. But for neutral to bright headphones, especially aggressive ones like the HE6 and Elex... proceed at your own risk!\n",

    "title": "Audeze LCD5 with EQ is .... WOW (what took me so long)",
    "selftext": "So Ive had a couple of superb  headphones, of which my favorites have been the U12T Iem, Utopia 2022, KSE1200, yet none touch the speaker setup, but thats more to do with physicality.  Anyways, I always loved the technicality of the LCD5 for mixing but hated its tonality for music enjoyment, as its not enjoyable relative to the Utopia, or even the U12t.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xict0bc0iyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd00e3b32336bb99067869b285106ebc701b94c9\n\nAnyways having recently gotten the U12Ts I was very impressed, as they are pretty damn technical, yet also enjoyable for music enjoyment, and dont require EQ or anything.   I used to EQ the KSE1200 for example which I still think performs technically better than anything else I have, but its a pain....  So that comparison is what got me curious about WHAT IF I spend some time to EQ the LCD5 with a phase linear plugin.\n\nANYWAYS, this is what this post is about:\n\nThe U12T got me curious about adding EQ to the LCD5, and then I saw other people often complain about the LCD5 until they EQ it.  I used the Utopia 2022, as a reference for a tuning I enjoy.  I found in mac the app soundSource allows me to use some of the same software I use for mixing and mastering, to EQ these things.   After EQing it, it punches like the Utopia, but the resolution is still that of the most detailed headphone I have ever heard. Im gonna get hate for this, but even the Stax SR009 doesnt do bass like the LCD5 (or at least I imagine as I dont have them side by side, but I remember it doesnt do bass like the Utopia in terms of weight). With EQ the LCD5 is just WOW.   Now the downside however is this is a pain in the ass to have to setup.\n\nThe setup:\n\n•⁠  ⁠I  found a software in the MAC called soundsource that allows applying corrective curves and also some of the same plugins used for mastering.\n\n•⁠  ⁠On the above software Audeze LCD-5 was setup to Oratory reference.  This corrects some imbalances but also sounds a bit dull next to the Utopia when set to the same curve for example.\n\n•⁠  ⁠To correct that, I then follow this by adding a hi pass WAY below the hearing range at 16hz to help the driver work better not dealing with stuff I cannot hear anyways.   Then I re-add some of the frequencies in the 2.6k nd 5.1k (only about 2-3db), which are frequencies dulled by the oratory curve, in this headphone. This brings a bit of that character I like in vocals in the Utopia, but smooth like the LCD5's are good at.\n\nThe LCD5 can take HUGE gain vai EQ without distorting. Its honestly really impressive.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02k9l6yk0iyf1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b89d90635e2e02a6427c642433eeac833cb9b7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f6te6yk0iyf1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=009b587ecf81fffbbfaf2f95aa2aa5bdae0c7732",

    "selftext": "I know this has been beat to death multiple times with multiple sticks, but I was scrapin' the web and didn't end up satisfied - was looking for some more opinions. \n\nI have owned my HD600's for awhile now - a few years probably, and they were one of my first non-completely-crap headphones after using some ear splitty Sony's and BD's. I originally got them for mixing, as I was not really into audiophile listening with headphones (had decent speakers), but they I got bit by the bug. I have a few pairs I really like now, but I have always been curious about the other HD alternatives.\n\nIn my search for that beautiful midrange timber with some more heft in the bass, I got the HD660S2's not long after they were released. They were also really smooth, with great timbre, but even more \"veiled\" and after a year or two, I decided they were not for me, and moved them on. I kept the HD600's, but mostly as a reference, because the bass roll off displeases me. I would never reach for them over, for example, the Edition XS. Totally different sound signature, each with advantages and disadvantages, but overall, that's where that fell out for me.\n\nOn a lark, I just saw the 650's for $300 on Amazon, which is a pretty low price (might still be there if you are reading this soon after it posts - I literally just clicked on them) so I snagged them. I figure I will probably not like them better than the 600 and will send them back, but the curiosity is killing me. A lot of people say they are just a more warmer or even muffled 600, and some say they are an improvement.  I guess I will find out, but I am really curious to hear some fresh opinions from users of both. Which do you prefer and why? Are they both just out of date, with all the great sub $500 offerings out there these days? Not to mention the >$500 offerings.\n\nIn return for your opinions, I will share mine once I get these on my head for a week or so, and get a good solid impression. I am expecting to be underwhelmed. I kinda wonder if I need a tube amp to properly appreciate the HD6XO line. I really like my current dac/amp (dx9), but I could add a modestly priced tube amp to the arsenal.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m running into a bit of a challenge getting enough power for my main headphones from my Focusrite Scarlett 4th Gen 2i2. The interface itself is great for tracking and monitor control, but the headphone out just doesn’t have the juice I need for the Dan Clark AEON closed X which I love. Need it to record and track etc. \n\nI’ve tried a couple of external DAC/amp setups (one distorted badly from the Scarlett’s line outs, the other colored the sound more than I liked), and I’m now trying to figure out the *right* way to integrate an external amp or DAC/amp combo without messing up my monitor chain. \n\nMy Scarlett’s main outputs are already feeding my studio monitors, so I’m not sure of the best wiring approach. I tried Y splitters so I can keep the monitors as well as TRS to RCA on the zH3 by Fosi, it distorted. On the Schiit Magni it didn’t until higher levels but it did not sound good at all so I returned it. \n\nBasically I’m trying to answer:\n\n* What’s the cleanest way to add a dedicated headphone amp (or DAC/amp) to a Scarlett interface when the main outs are already used for monitors? Should I just upgrade to Topping E2x2 Audio Interface?\n\n* Are there any level-matching or wiring tricks to avoid distortion when feeding an external amp from an interface?\n\n* Would it make more sense to just switch to something like a Topping L50 as just amp (would it make a difference in the wiring) or FiiO k7 (has a DAC though.) I wanted to use the DAC just for pleasure casual listening outside my DAW. \n\nI’d prefer to keep using the Scarlett if possible (and definitely not use ASIO4ALL), but I’m open to what most people do for this type of setup.\n\nAppreciate any advice.

I was specifically listening to my favorite release this year, which is Revengeseekerz by Jane Remover. It is a\npretty loud and sometimes harsh electronic album that I've heard many times at this point through DT 990s but not through this setup.\n\nI noticed what I thought was peaking during some parts, but ultimately began to deduce it to the music just not being very well mixed and mastered for high-end listening application, but I'm still not 100% sure. The music is gritty, dirty, and honestly very fun to listen to. \n\nTruthfully the reason why I mention any of this is because I want to keep my things nice and prevent any wear, in other words, I want to protect my investment the best I can but I'm unsure if music like this (or any music) can really be considered \"unsafe\".\n\nI'll add, I am not listening at high volumes during this album, nor do I have anything EQ'd weirdly, it is essentially just a tube amp, a 6SN7 tube, and the headphones.\n\nIf anybody would want to hear what I'm talking\nabout, some songs I was questioning are all by Jane Remover:\n\nDreamflasher, movies for guys, Experimental Skin, search party.\n\nOnce again, I'm aware these songs are supposed to sound gritty, but there are also some more clear and crisp sections in each of these, so I'm trying to decide if I should embrace the grit and imperfections of these songs through the LCD 2c if it's safe, or continue on my Beyers.",

In the case of the first song, I believe the culprit is the Expanded Edition of the album, but I just can't find the original one in CD quality (digital) for offline use. Both FLAC versions are mixed too loudly (and don't feel as dynamic, though this might be placebo) and have artifacts that aren't (as) present on YouTube, otherwise YouTube is just as crisp and detailed, absolutely nothing is missing, it's just that it's a higher quality master and not that FLAC is more revealing... \n\nI would immensely appreciate help because the 1st song is arguably the most spectacular one I've ever heard on my HD 600, and the 2nd one has really great vocals and layering.\n\nOn a side note, about different file formats and masters:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjio4AM2uw)\n\nI thought this sounded great, but the FLAC version actually has noticeably more treble and bass which sound really, really great, not boosted and distorted at all. This is not because of FLAC because if you take that FLAC file, drop it in Audacity and export as a 128 kbps MP3, it's all still there unlike on YouTube, so some masters are really just different and it's not a matter of 128 kbps MP3 being audibly worse than up to 24-bit 192 kHz FLAC, really.

    "selftext": "I had a go at processing the HUTUBS data, which are in ear measurements of the HRTFs and HD 800 S for 96 subjects, and the HD 650 for 64 subjects.\n\nMy intent was to compare the accuracy of the gras and bk5128 rigs to real heads. Each measurement is compensated to the diffuse field curve of the respective head with a -1 dB slope. By compensating to that target we are in effect \"subtracting\" the effect of each individuals ear geometry and are left with only the perceived variation in frequency response between heads caused by the acoustic impedance of the headphone.\n\nHD 800 S:\n\nBoth measurement rigs rise up to 4kHz too quickly and also show the first peak occurring closer to 6k, while real heads show it occuring around 5k. Using a tone generator I can hear it peaking at 5.2khz on my head. The second peak occurs around 7k in HUTUBS. On my head I can hear it around 7.2kHz. Both rigs show it closer to 8 kHz.\n\nUsing this as a basis for EQ results in a much more pleasing sound than the harman target profiles which don't deal with these peaks adequality.\n\nHD 650:\n\nThe HD 650 shows a lot more variance, despite that, there are features in the response that aren't present on either GRAS or BK rig. The first being a peak at 5kHz. Using a tone generator I can hear this very clearly on my head. Then there is a strong recession between 6k and 8k Hz which the gras rig doesn't show clearly.\n\nUsing this as a basis to EQ results in these two headphones sounding the most similar I've ever heard two different models of headphone sound (albeit still different).\n\nI've included headphones.coms processing of the same data for 30 heads, and the results seem similar.\n\nMy take away from this is despite the variance of the results between heads there is a clear average or trend in terms of the most common locations for peaks and dips, and neither of the most common industry standard rigs match it.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe HUTUBS, GRAS and BK5128 measurements all use different units. HD 800 S unit variation is incredibly good so hopefully this isn't an issue. I sourced the GRAS measurements from crinacle and the BK5128 measurements from earphones archive, and overlayed them on top of crinacles measurement.",

    "selftext": "So you decide to upgrade your audio setup with a nice pair of headphones. BuT WhAt PaIr Of HeAdPhOnEs? You ask. Well here it is a guide to headphone tuning.\n\nSo first off there needs to be a disclaimer being no matter what headphones you buy, they will not sound perfect to you. Sonic \"perfection\" is entirely unique to you with complex ideas like HRTF and more importantly how that noggin of yours processes sounds. To get a \"perfect\" pair of headphones you will need our lord and savior PEQ.\n\nSo theres a lot of words thrown around which sound complicated but aren't.\n\nFrequency Response (FR)  \nThis is the closest to \"sound visualization\" as we can get in the headphones game. It can tell you relatively nothing about the technicalities of a headphone however it generally\\*\\*\\* shows how you will hear a pair of headphones from a sound point of view. What is of note is that every frequency exists RELATIVELY not absolutely and so the same audible effects can come from completely different looking graphs.\n\nTechnicalities  \nHarder to measure but still can get a general sense through THD or total harmonic distortion, Group Delay for resonance and distortion, CSD generally measures transience and the \"speed of the driver.\" ect ect. What is notable is that these generally can't be shown on FR graphs.\n\nSo now we have those down lets go through what on a FR graph actually is.\n\n<100hz Subbass generally lives down here.  \n100-200hz Mid bass generally lives here  \n250-400hz This can only be described as the thicket where thickness is pronounced for the midrange  \n500-1000hz Where the lower registers of vocals and instruments start plays a large role in midrange timbre and spatial announcement  \n1k-1.8k Female vocals generally live here along with middle registering instruments like piano the start of the \"sharpening\" range where sensitivities generally begin.  \n2-2.6k The first \"staging\" frequency. Turning it up adds a bit more sparkle and space to the frequencies before turning it down will add a more \"realistic\" but drier tone.  \n3-5k Welcome to the lower treble usually where sibilance is found on most listeners as 'tsch' and 'ssss' of cymbals are found here.  \n6K The second \"staging\" frequency just like 2.5k this adds \"space\" and \"depth\" to the frequencies below it.  \n7.5-9K The final \"staging\" frequency only this one includes more of the \"shininess\" than 6k or 2.5k.  \n10-12.5K The \"shiny\" area this will give a mirrored or shiny texture to sounds.  \n14-16k The plastic region turning this up can ruin the timbre of all other frequencies as it adds the extension to most of the treble.  \n18k An \"airy\" frequency can help add separation and space between the treble and midrange but comes with an added \"sparkle\"\n\nGlossary:  \nAir: The sense of space a singular note appears to have  \nStage/staging: The 3 dimensional existence sources have relative to you  \nTimbe: How relatively realistic a note appears to be  \nShiny: Hard to describe but almost like how a sound jumps at you relative to everything else with reference to treble.  \nPlastic: An artifical dryness to sound  \nSharpness: Difference to shine as shine is more of a texture effect while sharpness is how harsh the sound relatively is.   \n",

    "title": "Sennheiser HD490 Pro - as someone who started there audiophile journey with an HD6XX",
    "selftext": "My first pair of truly audiophile level headphones was definitely when I grabbed a Schiit Fulla 2 and a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX, back in early 2019 I think. That felt like a colossal jump. \n\nAfter many headphones and amps, especially since I started working from home half the week, I have started to look at my collection and understand each one of them and my preferred uses for them. Last night I had the opportunity to expand the rapidly growing collection and snag a pair of Sennheiser HD490 Pro for $100 off and they’d be here in the morning. I obviously did not walk away from that. \n\nAfter about 2-2.5 hours of listening, I see very clearly where these fit in my collection. But I still feel like it want a 6XX/600/650. All the things the 600 family can’t do well, they do really really well. But there is just something about that 600 family. I would even say that I feel let down by the vocal presentation of the HD490 Pro's either, so I think it may just be some rose tinted glasses effect as I haven't owned my 6XX in nearly 4 years. Anyway, I started by just listening to the suede pads for the first 3-4 hours, and have now been listening to the other set. Both pads felt nothing less than phenomenal on my head. These headphones are so light and the padding is so so soft. \n\nThe suede pads are definitely warmer and more relaxed, however after listening to both and EQ'ing with both, I find myself preferring the others. I don't know which are the mixing and which is the mastering set. The reason I am finding myself prefering these pads, I think, is because of the perceived extra detail from the mids and highs along with a more airy and open sense or a stage. I do understand why Sennheiser didn't have these in the 600 family, but I understand why so many have compared them, and I think there are some similarities.\n\nThe drivers definitely remind me a lot of the drivers from the 600 family (at least visually from the outside) but they provide a wildly accurate sense of imaging across the largest soundstage I’ve heard from a Sennheiser, it’s not even close. In my opinion they pull this off with a sound signature that is easy to listen to but honest and competent, and definitely a Sennheiser open back. That all being said, I have not tried an HD800S and I have heard they are exceptional at this. \n\nAs someone that has been very blissfully enjoying planar headphones in the Ananda Nano (now only $320 on Amazon, INSANE), I found myself nervous to try dynamic drivers again, but I knew I needed to try some specific ones in the budget range before diving back in. \n\nWeirdly enough I chose the extremely divisive Grell OAE1 signature edition, as I was able to scoop them up for only $100 from drop… I know what you want me to say, but I don’t hate them. They’re definitely not the headphone I’m going for to listen to music, but they are exceptional for their soundstage in gaming. I do think it is interesting how in many ways the sound at least initially is very similar to that of the HD490 Pro, but not at all in the way it is presented. Maybe something I will dive into later after I have compared both side by side. I am curious how the HD490 Pro stacks up against it especially in regards to staging, but I expect the Sennheiser will be far more accurate in its imaging and may even be able to project a wider soundstage just based on what I’m hearing in my music as I work today. I will post an update in this thread when the time comes.\n\nI absolutely have to talk about this last bit though. This cable is not floating my boat. I will be buying a new balanced cable just for these headphones, and I can't wait to have to do the same for the 600 series I end up with. Bottom line, these Sennheiser HD490 Pro’s are a staple headphone on my desk, and will likely soon be joined by an HD600/6XX/650. Now the question is which one?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts if you’ve heard any of the headphones I talked about, I’d love to hear other’s perspectives on my take as well as the headphones I talk about. Maybe someone can sway me towards the 600 set I’ll get.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I don't talk on here very often but I had been searching for headphones after my last pair which lasted me about 13 years (Sennheiser HD598's) and still worked fine.\n\nI settled on the Aune AR5000's because they fit my pricepoint. I got them, EQ'd them and fell in love with that nice creamy bass.\n\nThat was exactly 14 months ago. For my usage I babied them, was always gentle despite the feeling of sturdy construction, and adored them. Never dropped.\n\nI have a small'ish to medium head. When I would use my pc I would simply pick them up and put them on like any other headphone.\n\nToday I wake up and the absolute weirdest thing happen, I went to put them on but they weren't... feeling right, I checked and YEP, they had cracked from soft usage after a year. I had seen other users with the pin for the ear support coming out because it was plastic but thought it would never happen to me because I'm so gentle with them.\n\nI have emailed my retailer and aune to see what they say but I'm pretty sure I'm SOL.\n\nMy advice? DO NOT BUY. This isn't a quality control problem, its a design and fundamental flaw in having that section made from plastic.\n\nI'm livid and now have to go searching for new headphones AGAIN.\n\n\n\nEDIT: If aune refuse to help I will investigate the replacement bands, or just outright upgrade to a pair of Meze 105's\n\nThese headphones were great for gaming and music and I feel the 105's have a better looking construction.\n\nAlso after plugging my over decade old HD598's they sound almost as good as the Aune AR5000's. So I think my over-enthusiasm for their sound might have been for reasons I can't explain. These are 90% the headphone sound of them and considering the age of them, that's hilarious.",

    "title": "Wf-1000XM5 vs Bose QC Ultra earbuds compared after 1 year of use",
    "selftext": "I own both, and use both extensively. Typically, the Bose is used at home while the XM5s are used during my morning commute (train) and at work. However I've done it the other way around countless times.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nI love the ANC on the headphone version of the XM5s, so I know it's great. However for the earphone XM5s, the adaptive ANC feature lets so much sound in at standard levels that it's frankly irritating how much sound it lets in. Whether it's the desk fan, the compressor on my fridge, or the ambient noises of a commuter train. Meanwhile, the Bose blocks almost everything to the point of near-silence.\n\nOn a flight, I'd say they're near equal, but the Bose comes out ahead for consistency.\n\n*Winner: Bose*\n\n**Comfort:**\n\nHighly subjective but the XM5s just fit in my ear better, despite a smoother exterior profile. The Bose have a rubber ridge that's meant to more snugly rest on your inner ear, but when I smile/laugh or brush my teeth, the Bose have a tendency to wriggle themselves loose. They've never fallen out entirely, but I'd need to readjust them.\n\n*Winner: Sony*\n\n**Sound Quality:**\n\nBose hands down. The XM5s midrange sounds way too hollow, and compared to my other headphones and IEMs, even the headphone XM5s, it makes listening to my music unpleasant.\n\nWinner: Bose\n\n**Charging Case:**\n\nSony's charging case stands up tall, so you can open the case while it's resting on a table surface. Meanwhile, the Bose case lays flat on its back, so you need to pick it up to open it. It also takes up more desk space.\n\nHowever, that means that the Sony charging case holds roughly 50-60% (in my experience) the charge of the Bose's case.\n\n*Winner: No clear winner here. I don't mind having a smaller charge in return for a smaller case.*\n\n**Default User Experience**\n\nWhen you put on the Sony, there is a gentle boop sound when it's connected to your devices, and a quiet voice reminder when the battery gets too low.\n\nOn the Bose, when the earphones start up, it proceeds to play basically the THX logo sound directly into your ears every single time. Then when it connects to a device, the robotic AI voice says the device name every time, even if the device name is really long. If you have multiple devices you need to wait to play whatever you were trying to listen to. I promptly disabled voice prompts but it still talks when I switch audio modes. Whose stupid idea was this.\n\nWinner: Sony\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFor most people, I'd recommend the XM5s despite the annoying adaptive ANC feature and audio quality, since using it is overall just less abrasive on a day to day basis.\n\nBut if you want more charge out of your case, and your ambient environment is consistently noisy, get the Bose and just never worry about background noise ever again.",

Toppings DAC/AMP/PRE which now has their 1-bit DAC architecture and their somewhat controversial NFCA amp modules. I'm expecting a snappy, separated, lean-leaning sound, but worried about it being too smooth (1-bit nature) having owned the D90 Discrete III recently, which is a very good and smooth DAC, just not sure if it's the right signature for the LCD-4? The LCD-4 is already smooth in the treble and could use some added bite and incisiveness there.\n\nAnother area of concern is potentially shallow stage depth, a common complaint with their NFCA amp tech. I love the power output specs and\nPEQ is a really nice addition though.\n\n\n[Cayin iH8-A]\n\nSuper powerful true class A, amp only. Has a hyper bottom that supercharges the sound to become more dynamic and incisive. \n\n\n\nThe question really here is: does the LCD-4 in particular benefit from powerful class A or a more analytically leaning yet powerful NFCA Topping amp? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "My thoughts on the Arya Organics (I know there’s plenty of reviews etc, but what harm can another do)\n\nI jumped into this hobby about 2 years ago roughly. Through that time, I’ve been through plenty headphones, but the only ones I spent a LOT of time with was 2. The Arya Stealth, and the HD560s. \n\n(Skip further down if you don’t care about the previous stories)\n\nThe Stealths were mind blowing to me, I did have planars before these. The edition xs (felt way too cheap for the 300 mark at the time. The Ananda Nanos (clamped like a vice). So picked up the Arya Stealths for £710, which was their cheapest price at the time. I owned these for 6 months. Every time I put them on, I was astounded at the sound. However, after 2 months, I rarely used them, I didn’t have the time to listen, and didn’t want £700 lying around. So I reluctantly sold them, and decided to pick up the cheaper pair, the HD560s. So I could still enjoy music, without feeling guilty having some premium set collecting dust. And these were fine, for £90, they were great.\n\nRecently however I’m now in a position where I have a lot more free time, and for that reason, I wanted to pick up a higher end headphone again. I was debating between many, but in the end it kept boiling down to the Stealths, which were now £460. But then saw the Organics were just £120 extra as “open-box” from Hifiman. One thing I absolutely hated with the Stealths was how harsh some of the treble was, and at the time I didn’t have EQ. So I was stuck with harsh treble in a few songs I enjoyed other times. Between owning the 560s and Stealths, I did pick up the JDS Element 4 Dac/Amp in preparation for higher end cans in the future, and to play around with EQ. So hearing the Organics had a harsh treble, it didn’t really deter me as I had the capabilities to town it down.\n\nSo now onto the Organics…\n\nLOOKS:\nThese things are absolutely gorgeous! It’s like taking your grandads beautifully varnished wooden table and chairs, and adding a modern touch to it. It makes them stand out and look far more premium than the price suggests (I’m aware they were 1500 odd on release, but on current pricing, the point stands). They feel more premium for this matter. I the one massive negative, is you have to wear them to listen, meaning I can’t just stare at them when in use. \n\nCOMFORT:\nAnyone who’s familiar with the Arya lineup, know that this line of headphones are on the comfier side of the Hifiman brand. They clamp just enough to not feel loose, but not too hard that it feels like the hulk is crushing your skull (Nanos). Yes the pads aren’t the most comfy pads on any headphone, they’re actually the one aspect I don’t like. They don’t feel premium, and the fabric design sometimes catches the odd strand of hair which isn’t pleasant. However changing these means altering the sound, which you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, want to do. The headband is perfect though. Suspended straps are my favourite on headphones, adds a premium feel, look and feels like far less pressure on your head. Not to mention how wide they are, it helps distribute the weight so well.\n\nUNBOXING: \nDead, £5 unboxing experience, but realistically who cares…\n\nSOUND:\nGrand. Exciting. Smooth. \n\nThe 3 words I’d use to describe the sound. Which goes to show how versatile they are. They give off such a ‘grand’ feeling, when you listen to orchestral pieces, it feels like you’re in a theatre listening to a band playing, but like you’re middle row. Not first row where it feels in your face, and not back row that it feels like it’s far away. It’s that perfect middle ground where it’s around you, but so that you can hear everything so cleanly. They’re exciting in the sense that after an orchestral piece, you put on an EDM track, pop or anything in that region, and it feels like you want to get up and just dance, but don’t, as these probably would fall off your head. And then you go for a very vocal focused piece of music, and the smoothness of the voice just glides through your ears. There’s no moment where it’s aggressive (unless it needs to be) or where it holds back. It’s like an electric supercar. You put your foot down, and it picks up straight away, but with no aggression, just picks up and gets going right away. \n\nOnto the specifics:\n\nBASS - Very solid. Definitely stronger than the Arya Stealths. When I had them, the bass was there, but it needed a tad more punch. These add that very subtle punch, where you know it’s bass, but it doesn’t slip into the other frequencies and overthrow them. It’s controlled VERY well. The sub bass is fantastic too. My favourite song to test this is “The Droid Invasion and the Appearance of Darth Maul” from The Phantom Menace. The drums at the start provide that sub bass test and it really shows how it handles it well. Doesn’t get fatiguing, just presents it so smoothly. Not to mention how clear the drums sound, like you can visualise the fabric drum stick hitting against the massive drum. The bass is also quick when needing to be. In many pop songs where there is the common use of bass, or in rap music, it’ll show the bass, and stop it perfectly. It never feels like it over presents itself. They also hold the bass off so well from overpowering the mids. Many headphones either make the bass so minimal that you don’t realise there should be bass, and many push it so hard it dims down the vocals. These control it so so well.\n\nMIDS - I would say the weakest out of the Low, Mid and High ends. Definitely NOT bad, it’s really really great. However when there is consistent bass present, and a lot of higher end or many many instruments playing, the vocals definitely take a seat back. They’re still very clear, but it pushes the instruments forward a bit more. Which isn’t bad at all, and some people may prefer this. It’s more of a preference thing. I certainly don’t mind it, and it’s not something I’m gonna be quickly to go and EQ, but if I was, it’s the first thing I’d play with, just to bring them forward a touch. BUT, when there’s only a low end and vocals, or high end and vocals, they are stunning. They just sound so real and ‘organic’, it’s like having a conversation with David Attenborough, just so nicely spoken and a voice you wish could commentate on your whole life. \n\nHIGHS - Lies were told here, or obviously it’s just down to personal hearing. But these are NOT ‘peaky’ or ‘harsh’. The high end is so well controlled. With the Arya Stealth, I absolutely could not listen to Nightcall - Kavinsky from Drive. The chorus of the song was so harsh I literally couldn’t listen to it. So the first song I wanted to try was that, and on these I could listen to the entire song with no issues. They have just enough brightness to make everything sound clean and clear, but not too much that it comes across as piercing during songs. Same with Time - Pink Floyd. The start with all the clocks can be very piercing with poorly controlled highs, but it’s like the headphones actively know it’s going to sound harsh and presents them just a tone down so that you don’t have to turn the volume down or skip forward. It was my one worry with these, and although EQ is an option, I did want to enjoy them stock for as long as possible. Which I’m ecstatic with the fact I can.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE - Wide, but not artificially wide, just naturally wide. Like I said with the orchestral hall and being “grand”. It just sounds so perfectly deep. It’s not like the sound is coming from across the room, but it’s not like the song is being played right next to you. It’s similar to car speakers, in the way it’s all round you, but not as if you’re listening to the persons car next to you. It’s intimate enough that you feel like it’s YOUR music, not someone else’s near you, but also distant enough that it’s like it’s your own personal concert. \n\nSEPARATION - Always tough because if a song is produced badly, even the greatest ever headphones won’t be able to separate the parts. But in a well produced track, you can actively hear each and every instrument and voice. In “Call it what you want” by Taylor Swift, there’s many instances where there are backing vocals playing over Taylor, and you can hear each one clearly, but as if they’re actually behind her. Like Taylor’s singing into your ear, whilst the backing singer is sat 2 foot behind her also singing, but you can clearly tell one is the main, one is the backing. The 560s definitely struggled with this, you often couldn’t hear the multiple voices, so now listening to many songs, I’m hearing voices I didn’t realise were there (I actually checked on 2 occasions that I wasn’t listening to a remix).\n\nConclusion:\nYes. Just yes. Stellar\n\nSetup I’m using:\nHifiman Arya Organic -> JDS Element 4 -> MacBook M3 -> Audirvana (because Tidal is buggy as anything on Mac since iOS 26 and Apple Music doesn’t auto change the Sample Rate) \n",

    "title": "A New Study on the Equivalence of Harman OE Target on Modern Test Fixtures, Co-authored by Sean Olive and Dan Clark Audio",
    "selftext": "> Summarized by Qwen.\n\nFor years, the *Harman target*—a frequency response profile derived from extensive double-blind listening tests—has served as a benchmark for “neutral” or preferred headphone sound. Originally defined using a specific GRAS 45CA test fixture equipped with a custom “Welti” pinna and an RA045 (Type 3.3) ear simulator, this target has become widely referenced in both research and product development.\n\nHowever, a critical issue has emerged: many modern labs and manufacturers now use newer test fixtures—such as the **GRAS 45CA-10** (with KB5000 anthropomorphic pinna and RA0402 ear simulator) and the **Brüel & Kjær Type 5128** (featuring a Type 4.3 ear simulator compliant with ITU-T P.57). These fixtures differ acoustically from the original Harman setup, particularly in their **acoustic transfer impedance**, especially below 500 Hz and above 3 kHz. Applying the original Harman target directly to measurements from these newer systems can lead to misinterpretation—and potentially misguided tuning decisions.\n\nIn a new paper presented at the **AES 159th Convention** (October 2025), **Sean Olive** (the architect of the Harman target) and **Dan Clark** address this problem head-on. Their work defines *Harman-equivalent targets* specifically calibrated for the GRAS 45CA-10 and B&K 5128 fixtures, ensuring that headphones tuned to these revised targets will sound subjectively similar to those tuned to the original Harman reference.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe authors measured seven diverse headphones including open-back and closed-back models from Dan Clark Audio, HiFiMan, and Sennheiser—on all three fixtures (original Welti, GRAS 45CA-10, and B&K 5128). Using a straightforward calibration method in Room EQ Wizard (REW), they derived fixture-specific targets by:\n\n1. Measuring each headphone on both the original and new fixtures.\n2. Computing the ratio between responses (e.g., KB5000 / Welti).\n3. Applying this ratio to the original Harman target (phase-conjugated and smoothed) to generate a new, equivalent target.\n\nThis process accounts for the unique acoustic loading and leakage characteristics of each fixture.\n\n## Listening Tests Confirm Validity\n\nTo validate the approach, the team conducted controlled **MUSHRA-style listening tests** with 13 experienced listeners, comparing seven versions of the target:\n\n- The original Harman target (Reference)\n- Fixture-specific targets calibrated per headphone\n- Targets averaged across 7 or 20 headphones\n\nResults were clear: when headphones were equalized to their **fixture-specific, individually calibrated targets**, they sounded **nearly identical** to the original Harman reference. In statistical terms, the **B&K 5128** and **GRAS 45CA-10** targets (calibrated per model) were **not significantly different** from the reference in perceived similarity.\n\nBy contrast, targets derived from **averages across multiple headphones** (e.g., “5128_20”) scored lower—though still within the “very similar” range—highlighting that **individual calibration yields the best match**.\n\nInterestingly, the type of headphone (open vs. closed-back) had minimal impact on results, suggesting the method is robust across designs.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nFor engineers and audiophiles alike, this work resolves a long-standing ambiguity: **you cannot directly apply the classic Harman target to measurements taken on modern fixtures** and expect accurate tuning. Instead, fixture-specific equivalents are needed.\n\nEncouragingly, the differences between targets are often correctable with **simple bass and treble shelving filters**, as most deviations occur in well-defined frequency regions. This opens the door for more consistent, cross-platform headphone evaluation—and more reliable interpretations of published measurements.\n\nWhile the study focused on seven models, the calibration framework is generalizable. Future work may yield standardized correction targets for common fixtures, enabling broader adoption without per-headphone measurement.\n\n## Reference\n\nOlive, S., & Clark, D.

It’ll make the sound like it’s waking up but all i get is a black screen and I have to hard reboot it to get video back. This only started being an issue about a month or two ago.

Obviously not easy to do on a small device so I bought a JSAUX dock and a long USB cable for an old Xbox controller I had laying around. Got the video feed on the LG OLED C1 65\", sound is fine and I can boot up Celeste without issue.\n\nProblem is, when it comes to relative fast animation (even something as simple as pixel art) the Steam Deck *lags* a lot. To give an example, when dashing through the level to progress the Deck will lag. When not moving and letting the game run, the Deck will even out the frames and return to normalcy. None of this happens while I'm just using the Steam Deck; no external displays or anything.\n\nI've checked the TV's game optimizer settings and tinkered around with as much as I could; no noticeable changes. Checked Steam's Display Settings and limited it to 720p, no changes. Tried asking ChatGPT for general advice and step by step directions, no help. Am I missing something here?",

Will I have more of an issue getting certain games, mods for games requiring a mod loader program(think Sonic), etc. to work? How often would I have to type out commands to get certain processes to work? Is it truly that much easier? Can I still set up and use Decky Loader stuff? Does it have a charge limit function? Does it work with the Dock? Lastly, would you still suggest I stick with SteamOS despite all of that?\n\nPlease and thank you.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m running into a persistent issue with Halo: The Master Chief Collection on my Steam Deck. Basically, whenever I load Halo 2 Anniversary from a checkpoint, the game immediately hits a Fatal Error crash. I also tried testing Halo CE Anniversary, and after a few minutes of gameplay, it crashes the same way.\n\nI’ve already tried basically everything I can think of:\n\t•\tSwitching between Proton Experimental and Proton 9\n\t•\tUsing Proton-GE (latest release via ProtonUp-Qt)\n\t•\tDeleting the Proton prefix (~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/976730)\n\t•\tClearing the shader cache (~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/shadercache/976730)\n\t•\tRunning in Classic graphics mode\n\t•\tDisabling V-Sync\n\t•\tTrying WinED3D to bypass DXVK\n\nI’ve also tried adjusting launch options with DXVK_ASYNC=1, enabling the DXVK HUD, and forcing a full clean reinstall, but the crashes persist no matter what.\n\nFrom what I can tell from the crash dumps, the issue seems to be DXVK / Proton related — the stack trace points to dxvk::DxvkQueue::submit and wine_vkQueueSubmit. It seems like the Unreal Engine calls are triggering a fatal error inside the DXVK/Vulkan translation layer.\n\nAt this point, I’m out of options. I’m wondering if anyone else has managed to get MCC working reliably on a Steam Deck with Halo 2 Anniversary or CE Anniversary, or if this is just a limitation of Proton/DXVK for now.\n\nHas anyone found a workaround that actually lets these titles run without crashing on a Steam Deck? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

    "selftext": "I ordered a Steam Deck and made a skin for it on DecalGirl while it shipped. This thing just makes me happy when I look at it. I love my big old headphones with the coiled wire, the brown plaid, the characters from my favorite childhood show… I’m an idealist with a dopamine deficiency and I take the win when I get it. \n\nHaving been a pc gamer and builder for well over a decade, I’ve seen my gaming rig evolve with my financial situation. I started with a teen’s budget back in 2006 or so and have built 4 computers since, and they’ve grown closer to top-end with each new build.\n\nWhen the deck first came out, I was skeptical about its capabilities. I’d become a little snobbish about pc vs console, as we pc people can sometimes do, and just thought of the SD as another, more accessible thing for people who couldn’t build a pc. In other words, I was an asshole/clown/bag. Sorry about that.\n\nI had a kid soon after the SD launch and I found less and less time to be who I used to be. I went down a handheld emulation rabbit hole which was both entertaining and enlightening. I had all the games I wanted to play as a child and all the games I watched my older brothers play, all in a device the size of a gameboy! I played a handful of games but I had more fun setting up devices for friends and learning about emulation than actually playing. Even when I moved to a device that could emulate ps2 and switch, it was more about the tinkering and collecting games than playing. I experienced some burnout before I realized that maybe I don’t like to play the older games as much as I like to remember them.\n\nI have a somewhat vast collection of steam games and no desk in our new house. I share the tv with my now two kids and my wife.\n\nThe Steam Deck is no longer a downgrade, but a way to enjoy my short bursts of downtime in a (mostly) tinker-free way. My Steam Deck satisfies all my senses and although I don’t know if it’s for everyone, it has quieted my demons for a while.  \n\nFuck that was dramatic. I’m going to go play Slots and Daggers now.\n\n\n",

Nevertheless, I wanted to scan it again. So was in the console and entered \"sudo apt install calmav calmtk\" then I realized needed the Steam Deck password and wanted to close the console.

Most older games run pretty well on them and most modern indie games run quite well. They all have great build quality and oled screens.\n\nMost of these handhelds costs under $300 and some under $200 even, but they’re at very low volume. If valve makes one then it’ll be great and pretty much change the game. \n\nIf you look up the process it seems easy enough for most people, without any tinkering, just an app install on an android device and you’re ready. Can play your steam library on it. The security issues is putting me off and that’s kinda why I’d want valve to make an official one. \n\nBefore any of you guys downvote me, I want to say no, I don’t want this to be a steamdeck 2.

    "selftext": "Hi guys,  \nHere I want to share my experience with my Steam Deck. I've had my Steam Deck for about 2 years now, and it's the LCD version. As the title says, my Steam Deck has a problem with the internal cooling fan that doesn’t run properly. Specifically, the fan only runs at around 400–1000 RPM when the temperature is around 40–55°C, but it stays the same even when the temperature reaches 60–70°C. Normally, I’m sure it should be around 2000–3000 RPM.\n\nWhen I'm playing AAA games and the temperature reaches 70–80°C, the fan still stays at the same RPM, so sometimes it gets overheated and causes frame drops. Then suddenly the fan jumps to around 7000 RPM and goes back down again to 400–1000 RPM. Sometimes the fan works normally for a while and run at 3000-4000 RPM.\n\nnormally in the far cry 5 it would be run the fan around 5000-6000 RPM. But it didn’t work, and I’m still getting really bad frame drops to 15 FPS. and suddenly back to normal in second video and the temperature reaching up to around 70-80°C.  \nthe AAA games mostly like this in the first time i run the game, after several times it would be normal and get 60 FPS but sometime back to not normal again, but the worst one is when playing not AAA games, when the temperature is not high.\n\nDoes anyone else have the same problem?, I’ve already tried tweaking the fan settings, but it didn’t fix the issue.  \nI really need help to fix this issue.",

I understand there is Heroic Installer or whatever it's called and I'll give that a go when I next feel like faffing about, but I incorrectly assumed I could just download direct and it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nAnd to be fair, if the Dolphin browser wasn't complete garbage it probably wouldn't be so bad doing it this way. If I could just search for the fuggin' installed folder for the game (in this case Theme Hospital), it wouldn't be so bad. Turns out for Dolphin ,that's a tall order. It has currently been searching teh compdata folder and subfolders for 45 minutes with no joy.\n\nI wondered \"maybe the game didn't actually install\" so I created a new subfolder in a random subfolder and searched for that.\n\nYou guessed it! Another 45 minutes have passed and it still hasn't found this new test folder I made.\n\nSo the Dolphin browser is shit, thus making this an unviable method.\n\nI gigured I'd ask here : is there something I can do? Is there a setting in Dolphin I am missing or just straight up another browser I can download that doesn't suck? Theme Hospital isn't a big game, but it makes my eye twitch thinking there is some storage space gobbled up by the void and there's fuck all I can do, save browse EVERY SINGLE FUCKING SUBFOLDER until I stumble across it.\n\nSorry this is ranting. For me so far, the Steamdeck has been simultaneously the best and worst handheld I have ever owned. In fact, the fucking thing wouldn't boot up this morning so having spent hours troubleshooting that problem only to run into this problem with Dolphin, I'm on the verge of checking out with this fucking device.",

Not expecting much power from the seat but if I Can even play it for 2-3 hours and then charge while I try get some sleep and then play again when I wake up that would be perfect.\n\n\nAlso is there a website/Reddit page where I can check the expected battery life of the the Steam Deck when playing certain games?\n\nComplete begginer when it comes to handheld PC's so sorry if these seem like stupid questions, posting this across a few difereent Reddit pages for the best reach.",

Not expecting much power from the seat but if I Can even play it for 2-3 hours and then charge while I try get some sleep and then play again when I wake up that would be perfect.\n\n\nAlso is there a website/Reddit page where I can check the expected battery life of the the Steam Deck when playing certain games?\n\nComplete begginer when it comes to handheld PC's so sorry if these seem like stupid questions, posting this across a few difereent Reddit pages for the best reach.",

    "selftext": "I ordered a Steam Deck and made a skin for it on DecalGirl while it shipped. This thing just makes me happy when I look at it. I love my big old headphones with the coiled wire, the brown plaid, the characters from my favorite childhood show… I’m an idealist with a dopamine deficiency and I take the win when I get it. \n\nHaving been a pc gamer and builder for well over a decade, I’ve seen my gaming rig evolve with my financial situation. I started with a teen’s budget back in 2006 or so and have built 4 computers since, and they’ve grown closer to top-end with each new build.\n\nWhen the deck first came out, I was skeptical about its capabilities. I’d become a little snobbish about pc vs console, as we pc people can sometimes do, and just thought of the SD as another, more accessible thing for people who couldn’t build a pc. In other words, I was an asshole/clown/bag. Sorry about that.\n\nI had a kid soon after the SD launch and I found less and less time to be who I used to be. I went down a handheld emulation rabbit hole which was both entertaining and enlightening. I had all the games I wanted to play as a child and all the games I watched my older brothers play, all in a device the size of a gameboy! I played a handful of games but I had more fun setting up devices for friends and learning about emulation than actually playing. Even when I moved to a device that could emulate ps2 and switch, it was more about the tinkering and collecting games than playing. I experienced some burnout before I realized that maybe I don’t like to play the older games as much as I like to remember them.\n\nI have a somewhat vast collection of steam games and no desk in our new house. I share the tv with my now two kids and my wife.\n\nThe Steam Deck is no longer a downgrade, but a way to enjoy my short bursts of downtime in a (mostly) tinker-free way. My Steam Deck satisfies all my senses and although I don’t know if it’s for everyone, it has quieted my demons for a while.  \n\nFuck that was dramatic. I’m going to go play Slots and Daggers now.\n\n\n",

Will I have more of an issue getting certain games, mods for games requiring a mod loader program(think Sonic), etc. to work?

Obviously not easy to do on a small device so I bought a JSAUX dock and a long USB cable for an old Xbox controller I had laying around. Got the video feed on the LG OLED C1 65\", sound is fine and I can boot up Celeste without issue.\n\nProblem is, when it comes to relative fast animation (even something as simple as pixel art) the Steam Deck *lags* a lot. To give an example, when dashing through the level to progress the Deck will lag. When not moving and letting the game run, the Deck will even out the frames and return to normalcy. None of this happens while I'm just using the Steam Deck; no external displays or anything.\n\nI've checked the TV's game optimizer settings and tinkered around with as much as I could; no noticeable changes. Checked Steam's Display Settings and limited it to 720p, no changes. Tried asking ChatGPT for general advice and step by step directions, no help. Am I missing something here?",

    "selftext": "I ordered a Steam Deck and made a skin for it on DecalGirl while it shipped. This thing just makes me happy when I look at it. I love my big old headphones with the coiled wire, the brown plaid, the characters from my favorite childhood show… I’m an idealist with a dopamine deficiency and I take the win when I get it. \n\nHaving been a pc gamer and builder for well over a decade, I’ve seen my gaming rig evolve with my financial situation. I started with a teen’s budget back in 2006 or so and have built 4 computers since, and they’ve grown closer to top-end with each new build.\n\nWhen the deck first came out, I was skeptical about its capabilities. I’d become a little snobbish about pc vs console, as we pc people can sometimes do, and just thought of the SD as another, more accessible thing for people who couldn’t build a pc. In other words, I was an asshole/clown/bag. Sorry about that.\n\nI had a kid soon after the SD launch and I found less and less time to be who I used to be. I went down a handheld emulation rabbit hole which was both entertaining and enlightening. I had all the games I wanted to play as a child and all the games I watched my older brothers play, all in a device the size of a gameboy! I played a handful of games but I had more fun setting up devices for friends and learning about emulation than actually playing. Even when I moved to a device that could emulate ps2 and switch, it was more about the tinkering and collecting games than playing. I experienced some burnout before I realized that maybe I don’t like to play the older games as much as I like to remember them.\n\nI have a somewhat vast collection of steam games and no desk in our new house. I share the tv with my now two kids and my wife.\n\nThe Steam Deck is no longer a downgrade, but a way to enjoy my short bursts of downtime in a (mostly) tinker-free way. My Steam Deck satisfies all my senses and although I don’t know if it’s for everyone, it has quieted my demons for a while.  \n\nFuck that was dramatic. I’m going to go play Slots and Daggers now.\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello. I've run into a scenario that I'm trying to solve, or at least understand if it's unsolvable.\nI'm working on a project at a site with both underfloor heating and radiators. The underfloor heating has zonal control: thermostats in each room, and a wiring center (bus) that controls the pump, boiler, and each individual circuit.\nCurrently, this system works perfectly. The thermostats call for heat, the corresponding thermal actuator opens, and the room heats up. The thermostats are smart, Wi-Fi-enabled, and connect to Tuya. (They are Tervix brand, which is a local brand, but they are essentially Beok thermostats).\nNow, the client wants to install a smart thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) on the radiator in the same room. I'm trying to figure out how convenient this will be, or if it's even worth doing.\nI built a test bench to simulate this system and connected everything to Tuya. The problem is that I can't group the smart TRV and the wall thermostat together. I understand that having to configure both of them separately is very inconvenient and time-consuming. It should be a simple operation—just changing the room's temperature—but having to go into two separate menus to do this is tedious.\nI thought maybe Google Home, through its integration, would solve this problem, but no such luck, or perhaps I just haven't figured it out correctly.\nHas anyone else encountered this issue? How did you solve it?",

    "selftext": "I am going to be replacing an outdoor light with a Reolink camera flood light. On the simplest terms, if I do a direct swap then the camera (and light) will either be on or off depending on tow the current switch is flipped, far from ideal. Removing the switch is an option, there will always be power to the light and camera, but the only flood light control you get is either automatic based on detection, or on/off via an app. \n\nWhat I would like to do is configure some sort of smart switch into this electrical box where the switch is, so that it will always deliver power to the flood light unit, but use a smart action to only turn the light on or off depending on how the switch is flipped.\n\nThe problem is, from what I found, is most smart switches are also made to function as dumb switches so they can be used even if the network goes down. So none of them have a feature setting where you can set the switch to just always deliver power out, but have the on/off function control some unrelated device. \n\nWhat I am almost going to resort to is removing the switch, putting on a blank plate, and sticking a smart button onto the plate. This way the unit always has power but depending on the button push the flood light will turn on or off. Problem is this is not very clean, and these smart buttons are all battery powered so they will die and need new batteries every so often.\n\nDoes there exist some switch for specifically this use case?",

    "selftext": "Ever since early 2025 there has been a persistent high number of homes and public buildings with having a smart Wi-Fi switch and a smart Wi-Fi light at the same time for ceiling mounted outdoor holiday lights. Please do not do that as holiday lights cannot be dimmed by switches since they change color and brightness on its own control. I highly recommend that you get a standard switch before you install a holiday light.\n\nIf your lights flicker right now you need to listen to me. Switches don’t have the ability to dim holiday lights. Holiday lights are color lights and its brightness is not controlled by a switch. It uses third-party to change color brightness.",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial “security fog” systems shops use — the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it’s harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I’ve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2–3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI’m trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I’m trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that’s actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won’t wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20–30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** – Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the “safe default” for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** – Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that’s meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** – Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** – if anyone has done the “alarm → webhook/SMS → Pi → relay → device” pattern, I’d love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it’s just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = “leave now.”\n\nIf this isn’t allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows.

Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate. Please advise.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dik98j6336yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd4bbf8867ff80c1d200863bd763861ea8117c60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efo49k2636yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d1adf32542880f2121f73e03474a770ecb68305\n\n",

Any recommendations on products to use?\n\nSorry for the newb questions.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Meaning I can send a signal to _something_ to turn on when music starts playing.\n\nI suspect that something can be some sort of a 220v plug that connects an extension with multiple sockets where all the gear is plugged in. \n\nThat something must have some sort of way to turn on/off programatically and must be overriden physically. For example for streaming I want it to turn on automatically but when I want to spin some vinyl records, I want to turn it on physically. I coud live without this feature though.\n\nI canno use some DIY solutions like raspberry pi relay hats as I need proper insulation. I have a super curious toddler at home.

I am going to test if setting them to a timer say turn on at 6pm and off by 6am would work but I have a feeling that they will still not work unless my phone is present and in range of the bulbs. \n\nMy question is what is the best way to ensure these lights can turn on and off via a timer even if I am not present? I am new to smart hubs and not sure if one would fix this issue. I am unsure if a smart hub would store the information to turn the lights on and off at a certain time on it and even if I was out of town or away, the lights would turn on and off at their set time.\n\nAny information, a YT video, or insight would be greatly appreciated. I want to automate this so I don't have to worry about my phones placement or do it manually all the time.\n\nEdit: turning the lights to a set timer as opposed to sunrise/sunset seemed to fix the issue.

    "title": "New lighting setup questions",
    "selftext": "6ish years ago when w moved in we made every lightswitch in the house a gen1 Lightwave switch (which is now pretty much discontinued). They've always been a bit... Odd (sometimes the remote switches on a different light) but they seem to be on the way out now. Two different switches, within about a week of each other no longer work properly. They switch on but as soon as the lights get to full brightness they switch off and the light on the switch blinks. If there's a quick fix that anyone else is aware of (I've tried resetting them, leaving them unpowered for a while) then I'm happy to try it, but I think in all honesty I'm looking for a replacement set-up.\n\n \n\nMy requirements are\n\n* Needs to still work when Internet is offline.\n* Needs to be controllable by a physical switch on the wall.\n* Needs to work without a neutral wire.\n* Would like to still be able to dim the bulbs.\n* A mix of 7 bayonet and 21 GU10 bulbs across 12 circuits.\n\n \n\nI think pretty much everything else is flexible\n\n* Don't mind whether they're WiFi / Zigbee etc. House isn't big so coverage for both is easy.\n* Don't mind buying a hub for local control.\n* Bonus if it integrates with Google Home app (lightwave does for control, but not for status).\n* Bonus if I can integrate it with existing Aqara Zigbee motion sensors without using the Internet.\n* Don't mind getting an electrician to come do some rewiring around the switches.\n* As long as I can control them through the one interface, I don't mind if different rooms have different brands.\n\nBack when we started, these requirements ruled out smart bulbs as they were all app only, but now you can buy switches that talk to the lights that can be attached to the wall.\n\n \n\nMy first question is, if I go with smart bulbs, can I wire the circuit to be permanently on, put a blank faceplate on it, and then stick a remote (Zigbee?) switch to it.\n\nSecond question, again for going with smart bulbs, is can I use a switch that's powered by the lighting circuit as it's controlling the bulbs, not the circuit (so the physical switch is always on so no neutral required, so the switch can remain powered). \n\nThird question, again for smart bulbs, is that our bathroom fans come on with the lights currently, and then stay on for 5-10 minutes after the light is switched off. Would I need a separate switch of sorts for these?\n\n \n\nAs far as I can see it I've got 3 options:\n\nSmart bulbs (Trådfri/Hue?) and either wireless or wired-in switches\n\nSmart Relays (Shelly?) and wireless switches\n\nSmart switches and dumb (dimmable) bulbs\n\n \n\nAm I missing anything?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I've got a weird situation that feels solvable, but I can't quite work it out:\n\n* I've got an older home (no neutral wires on switch-controlled circuits on walls and ceilings).\n* I've got a dumb wall switch that controls the ceiling lamp in the garage (on/off only). The switch is not *in* the garage, but in the room that you enter the garage from.\n* In most of the neighborhood garages, this circuit just a bare-bulb in a ceiling-mounted lamp base, but my garage has a fan-box mounted with a \"dumb\" ceiling fan fitted.  This works fine because you can switch on the light as you enter the garage and the dumb fan controller just goes back to whatever speed you set it from the remote last time.\n* I've got a Hubitat Elevation and a number of smart devices in other rooms nearby.\n\nThe dilemma: I would like to have some additional smart sockets turn on when I turn on the garage light and go in there to do garage things.  However, I am loathe to change the wall switch because (a) this is a part of the house with older style toggle switches and the lutron style controls would mean revamping all the other wall switches in the room or having a weird mismatch and (b) the lack of a neutral wire really limits my choices in wall controllers.\n\nSo the question I have is: \"Is there some way to generate a reliable on/off signal from the \"dumb\" end of the ceiling fan/junction box?\"\n\nObviously the trick is that switching off from the wall kills the power which makes it challenging to send a signal! I have almost thought about just using a light sensor in the garage to detect when the garage light is turned on/off, but the garage-door includes some clerestory windows so there is frequently daylight in the afternoons...\n\nEDIT: And yes, I can add a smart button to just drive all the things directly, but the goal is to have the other actions take place when I just turn on the garage light, if possible.",

A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "Hello. I've run into a scenario that I'm trying to solve, or at least understand if it's unsolvable.\nI'm working on a project at a site with both underfloor heating and radiators. The underfloor heating has zonal control: thermostats in each room, and a wiring center (bus) that controls the pump, boiler, and each individual circuit.\nCurrently, this system works perfectly. The thermostats call for heat, the corresponding thermal actuator opens, and the room heats up. The thermostats are smart, Wi-Fi-enabled, and connect to Tuya. (They are Tervix brand, which is a local brand, but they are essentially Beok thermostats).\nNow, the client wants to install a smart thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) on the radiator in the same room. I'm trying to figure out how convenient this will be, or if it's even worth doing.\nI built a test bench to simulate this system and connected everything to Tuya. The problem is that I can't group the smart TRV and the wall thermostat together. I understand that having to configure both of them separately is very inconvenient and time-consuming. It should be a simple operation—just changing the room's temperature—but having to go into two separate menus to do this is tedious.\nI thought maybe Google Home, through its integration, would solve this problem, but no such luck, or perhaps I just haven't figured it out correctly.\nHas anyone else encountered this issue? How did you solve it?",

    "selftext": "I am going to be replacing an outdoor light with a Reolink camera flood light. On the simplest terms, if I do a direct swap then the camera (and light) will either be on or off depending on tow the current switch is flipped, far from ideal. Removing the switch is an option, there will always be power to the light and camera, but the only flood light control you get is either automatic based on detection, or on/off via an app. \n\nWhat I would like to do is configure some sort of smart switch into this electrical box where the switch is, so that it will always deliver power to the flood light unit, but use a smart action to only turn the light on or off depending on how the switch is flipped.\n\nThe problem is, from what I found, is most smart switches are also made to function as dumb switches so they can be used even if the network goes down. So none of them have a feature setting where you can set the switch to just always deliver power out, but have the on/off function control some unrelated device. \n\nWhat I am almost going to resort to is removing the switch, putting on a blank plate, and sticking a smart button onto the plate. This way the unit always has power but depending on the button push the flood light will turn on or off. Problem is this is not very clean, and these smart buttons are all battery powered so they will die and need new batteries every so often.\n\nDoes there exist some switch for specifically this use case?",

I know I can get an LED replacement, and probably should, but I was looking for smart color changing ones and haven't had much luck.\n\nIs there any more niche company that makes this I'm unaware of?

Maybe there's some other bulb format I could use?\n\nAny input/advice appreciated.",

Why not a message \"your batteries are getting low, it's time to change them?\" Instead the stupid beep.  \n\nThe damn thing knows what time it is.  Knows my location.  Knows I'm a sleep.  And it has enough power to beep every 10 damn minutes all God damn night. It has enough power to stay connected to the Internet.  Has enough power to run a test when I hit the button on the app hoping it would shut off the damn beep.\n\nI can silence actual smoke detection in my house on the app but can't silence the damn low battery beep?  \n\nI'm so angry.  \n\nRant over.",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI recently found out about those commercial “security fog” systems shops use — the ones that instantly fill a room with thick but harmless fog so it’s harder for someone to see/grab stuff. The concept is perfect for what I want, but the real units I’ve found are $$$ (I keep seeing $2–3k+), which is way out of my range.\n\nI’m trying to do a budget/DIY version for a small apartment/home setup.\n\n**What I’m trying to do:**\n\n* I already have a SimpliSafe alarm system.\n* SimpliSafe only talks to SimpliSafe gear, so I was thinking of using a side channel (like having it text/call a number I control) and then having a Raspberry Pi / Arduino listen for that and fire a relay.\n* When it fires, I want:\n   1. A loud alarm / siren\n   2. A TTS/recorded voice warning to make it more intimidating\n   3. **Most importantly**: rapid release of **non-harmful**, indoor-safe fog that makes it hard to navigate/see\n\nI am **not** trying to gas anyone or do anything that’s actually hazardous. I specifically want the kind of fog juice / canisters that are basically water + glycol / glycerin like stage fog, and that won’t wreck lungs, pets, or furniture if it goes off for 20–30 seconds.\n\n**What I need help with:**\n\n1. **Sourcing** – Where can I get *reliable*, non-harmful fog fluid or pre-made fog cartridges that are meant to be used indoors, and not sketchy vape/unknown stuff? Are there brands that are considered the “safe default” for enclosed spaces?\n2. **Hardware direction** – Is it smarter to:\n   * hack a cheap theatrical / Halloween fog machine and trigger it with a relay, **or**\n   * use some kind of refillable canister system that’s meant for security/stage and trigger a solenoid?\n3. **Safety stuff** – Things I should watch out for (residue, overheating cheap foggers, ventilation, smoke alarms going off, humidity damage, etc.)\n4. **Raspberry Pi / Arduino integration** – if anyone has done the “alarm → webhook/SMS → Pi → relay → device” pattern, I’d love to see your setup.\n\n**Bonus question:** has anyone used voice/siren + fog together? Even if an intruder realizes it’s just fog, I figure the combination of loud audio + no visibility = “leave now.”\n\nIf this isn’t allowed here because of security topics, lmk what sub is better (DIY, homeautomation, or a Pi sub).\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have moved into a house with 12 massive skylights in the kitchen extension which look beautiful and im loathed to cover them at all but as I am so overlooked by the neighbours to the left and also at night, any light from the kitchen travels all through the house, keeping everyone awake. Not to mention the glare from the sun in the summer months. My wood furniture has already discoloured in less than 3 months so I am biting the bullet and going with hard wired honeycomb blinds (black) My concern is when the man came round to explain all that will happen it seems as though there will be permanent wires on all 12 of my windows. And will be visible even when the blinds will be up  (which is most days) As my windows aren't especially high up, i feel like they are going to ruin the look of my windows. Because the windows are so large, im told no other option is really possible and there will be something like 4 thin wires on each window to stop the blinds from sagging! Thats 48 wires on all my windows! Is that insane?\n\nAlthough  Im told they are really thin and  subtle this has really given me pause.  Im told if i get them in white they will disappear against the sky but my fear is im paying an arm and a leg for my windows to look like prison bars. Has anyone done these style blinds on similar windows? Do the wires look horrible? or are you okay with them? If i was to pick between ugly blinds and overheated furniture and less privacy i would honestly chose the latter. So just want to make sure im not going to be left with a permanent install i will hate. Please advise.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dik98j6336yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd4bbf8867ff80c1d200863bd763861ea8117c60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efo49k2636yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d1adf32542880f2121f73e03474a770ecb68305\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo, i'm all very new in the world of smart products but in ready to looking everyday to learn a bit more.\n\nI would like to replace my dumb Vaillant calorMatic 350 to a smart one, dont know which one yet.\n\nMy situation: I have one zone for bottom floor (floor heating gas) with this thermostat and i have the same thermostat in the bathroom upstairs with a second zone (radiators) there. I checked and the Vaillant is 2 wired.\n\nI guess i need to replace both of them with smart thermostat but in other rooms i have radiators where I want to add smart valves.\n\nCan I turn my radiators on and off seperately if the smart thermostat upstairs is for example on 20°c and i want another room 25°c?\n\nCan i just replace the Vaillant downstairs? Remove the one upstairs and just use the smart valves on the radiators, or do i need to replace the one upstairs also?\n\nAny recommendations what and how to do? Any recommendations on products to use?\n\nSorry for the newb questions.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello. I've run into a scenario that I'm trying to solve, or at least understand if it's unsolvable.\nI'm working on a project at a site with both underfloor heating and radiators. The underfloor heating has zonal control: thermostats in each room, and a wiring center (bus) that controls the pump, boiler, and each individual circuit.\nCurrently, this system works perfectly. The thermostats call for heat, the corresponding thermal actuator opens, and the room heats up. The thermostats are smart, Wi-Fi-enabled, and connect to Tuya. (They are Tervix brand, which is a local brand, but they are essentially Beok thermostats).\nNow, the client wants to install a smart thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) on the radiator in the same room. I'm trying to figure out how convenient this will be, or if it's even worth doing.\nI built a test bench to simulate this system and connected everything to Tuya. The problem is that I can't group the smart TRV and the wall thermostat together. I understand that having to configure both of them separately is very inconvenient and time-consuming. It should be a simple operation—just changing the room's temperature—but having to go into two separate menus to do this is tedious.\nI thought maybe Google Home, through its integration, would solve this problem, but no such luck, or perhaps I just haven't figured it out correctly.\nHas anyone else encountered this issue? How did you solve it?",

    "selftext": "I am going to be replacing an outdoor light with a Reolink camera flood light. On the simplest terms, if I do a direct swap then the camera (and light) will either be on or off depending on tow the current switch is flipped, far from ideal. Removing the switch is an option, there will always be power to the light and camera, but the only flood light control you get is either automatic based on detection, or on/off via an app. \n\nWhat I would like to do is configure some sort of smart switch into this electrical box where the switch is, so that it will always deliver power to the flood light unit, but use a smart action to only turn the light on or off depending on how the switch is flipped.\n\nThe problem is, from what I found, is most smart switches are also made to function as dumb switches so they can be used even if the network goes down. So none of them have a feature setting where you can set the switch to just always deliver power out, but have the on/off function control some unrelated device. \n\nWhat I am almost going to resort to is removing the switch, putting on a blank plate, and sticking a smart button onto the plate. This way the unit always has power but depending on the button push the flood light will turn on or off. Problem is this is not very clean, and these smart buttons are all battery powered so they will die and need new batteries every so often.\n\nDoes there exist some switch for specifically this use case?",

    "selftext": "When I saw the news about the AWS outage, my first thought was: “Uh oh, that’s going to break half the internet again”....\n\nSure enough, our colleague chat group exploded — people started sharing stories of their home security systems collapsing: “My Ring Cam won’t load,” “My Blink camera just shows blank,” “My smart lock app says server error and won’t unlock remotely\"... Hey? Ridiculous, right? Luckily my own smart locks were fine, and I haven’t installed any cloud-based camera systems at home yet, so I dodged that one.\n\nMeanwhile, I noticed that my company’s devices (cameras and the smart lock) just… worked. I didn’t even notice anything was wrong. Unlocking, fingerprint, logs... all handled locally. No cloud delay, no “server error,” nothing. (Not naming brands or models here, don’t want it to sound like an ad.)\n\nIt actually made me realize how invisible reliability feels.... you don’t notice it until everyone else loses it. No strong opinions here, just sharing a small takeaway: local-first might not sound sexy, but when half the web goes dark, it suddenly feels very smart.\n\nAnyone else got hit by the AWS outage?",

    "selftext": "After that conversation with a fellow Redditor about bringnox smart shades, I ended up ordering six units this year. I've even started recommending them to my clients (yes, I do professional home installation). Here's my detailed experience:\n\nThe ordering form is well-organized with clear categories. I didn't trust screen colors for fabric selection at the beginning. Since I wanted to verify both color accuracy and texture, I ordered their fabric sample book before my first purchase. For anyone with similar concerns, the swatches are totally worth the small investment and so cheap.\n\nTheir measurement video guide is fantastic – I followed it precisely. I measured top/middle/bottom of the window frame and used the smallest dimension (to ensure the shade would fit).\nInstallation is DIY-friendly for anyone moderately handy. The process is straightforward, and I just do: mark level screw positions, drill pilot holes, secure two brackets with a screwdriver, and then it can click the shade into place. Maybe some prople is no need to find the professional helps.\n\nConnecting to my Alexa system was painless. Their instructions are wonderfully clear with minimal steps - maybe the most beginner-friendly setup I've seen.",

While there are so many recommendations and good reviews, I’m unable to narrow down exactly which one I want. I don’t want to follow the hype and end up with one that won’t last long, considering their prices 😅.\n\nMy biggest fear is letting him spend so much money on such an uncommon thing, only for it to break down after a few months. So I’m not just looking at the smart features, but also how long-lasting it is, how easy it is to clean (materials), etc.\n\nIf you’ve bought a smart bed before, I’d like help with knowing:\n\n1. What are the best brands (a durable brand)?\n2. What are some of the factors I should look for when buying one, especially features like sensors, voice control, and temperature regulation?\n\nI’m looking for something comfortable, durable, and worth the price.",

Screen seem to make the most sense but I know it’s going to away from the “clean” look of the doors currently as the canister of the screen will be mounted above the doors or to the side.  It is what it is. Open to other suggestions too (hanging outdoor shades off the balcony far edge to block sunlight in the living room, retractable awning for the 2nd floor master bedroom, etc). \n\nWhat have people used and liked? I don’t mind having it installed but am fairly handy so can tackle an intermediate level DIY project. \n1) large opening slide screens? (Looking at wizard, mirage, Apollo)\n2) large opening motorized screens that comes down from the top? (Genius, wizard, I’m sure others)\n\nIt would be nice to use automation (plan on integrating home assistant into the house soon) to open and close the screen… so smart motorized options seem appealing.

I recently started with the Tapo bridge to fold in kasa with the tapo dimmer / button, which doesn't seem to work from the start.

The only way to add a switch is by using IFTTT. How do I do this? I’ve only set IFTTT rules on my phone, but this would be an IFTTT rule between two devices in my flat not using my phone. Can I create an IFTTT rule on my phone (“if left switch is turned on, left socket turns on”, etc) that will then work even when my phone is not involved (ie offline)?",

    "title": "Bluetti is finally getting a official Smart Home Integration!",
    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nIm Erik aka Selfmadestrom from the Bluetti community. Im working since month on the wish that people want to use Bluetti devices in their Smart Homes.\n\nFinally we can entry the last milestone on this journey. Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don’t support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man… there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is “THE SMARTEST”... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere’s what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren’t essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it’s like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world’s “smart homes” catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you’re running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit “nerd level 3000”... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like… what’s the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I’m starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone’s found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I’m cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn’t depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

    "selftext": "Hello Redditors. I just ordered some zigbee motorized blinds (Biltek) that come with a hub and remotes. What I am not really clear on is if the hub is all I require to be able to control these blinds and communicate with an app or will I also need to get a whole house hub??\n\nI just built my house so I have added a bunch of different smart tech - locks, heating system, garage doors are Wi-Fi, now blinds and I’ve got some Eufy cameras to install. It’s starting to be a lot of different apps so it might be worth it to get something to tie it all together. If that’s even possible- I’m not sure but I’m willing to bet that someone on here will know!!\n\nTIA!",

I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to get ready for work and when my alarm rings it's still dark outside which makes me groggy. To have a more pleasant morning experience, I was thinking about getting a smart-bulb which would simulate a sunrise effect. According to some studies I've read, that might help a bit with morning grogginess.\n\nI was curious to know - has anyone had experience with setting up bedroom smart-lights to \"sunset\" mode before waking up? How did that work out for You? Have You noticed a pleasant affect when using this feature?\n\nWhich bulb would You recommend for this purpose? I am looking for a Wi-Fi or hub-less option. That's basically the only smart feature I'm looking to implement in my apartament without buying additional gadgets, besides the bulb itself.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\n\nI do have a bedside lamp in which I would screw in the smart-bulb and leave it on 24/7. My plan was to set up the bulb using a smartphone app with the desired sunrise settings and forget it. Hence my idea for not wanting a hub.",

I’ve got the basics covered so far: a dishwasher, robot vacuum for cleaning, AC and central ventilation, a smart lock and cameras for security, plus whole-house lighting control and electric curtains.\n\nNow I’m thinking of adding something a bit different next, maybe for the shower room or the room that opens onto the balcony. I’ve been looking at a window cleaning robot that seems great for those big balcony windows. It needs to be placed on the window manually, but once it’s on, it can clean automatically. I guess it might also work for shower glass.\n\nI’m also thinking about trying a sunrise light on the balcony that syncs with my main lighting setup. Has anyone tried either of these? I’m leaning toward winbot for the window cleaning, but I haven’t found a sunrise light that fits into my google home setup yet.\n\nIf you’ve tried any uncommon or creative smart home gadgets, I’d love to hear what worked for you.

Great. But I still can’t connect to the keybox remotely.\n\n  \nI feel like I’ve tried everything : \n\n\\- deleting and readding the keybox. Didn’t change anything, although I saw the gateway in the keybox adding interface, which made me think they would be linked automatically… but no.\n\n\\- clicking on the gateway and add a sub device : it doesn’t detect the keybox. It tells me to have it in appairing mode, but there is nothing in the manual that tells me how to do so and to be detected by the app to add it normally, you just have to press any button.\n\n  \nIs there something I’m missing ?

    "selftext": "TL;DR - seeking wired zwave, zigbee or WiFi motion and/or presence sensors. The next requirement is that they have programmable sensitivity and trigger time. \n\nThanks!\n\n————-\n\n\nI’m tired of batteries. I cut out one use and have moved to rechargeable, mostly, but at this point I think I’m ready to just go wired where I can. It’s inconvenient to try doing this for door locks or contact sensors so I may as well target motion/presence ones. \n\nThat being said, it’s hard to get a good list of wired sensors with the options I need. I bought 2 that ended up being satisfactory but I can’t set their sensitivity and their re-trigger time is long @ 30s minimum. I bought some presence ones but they only work through Smartlife/Tuya, they set up in SmartThings and Alexa as dumb motion sensors with no options. Any help would be appreciated. I got some wink ones that were great, long battery life, seconds between re-triggering and variable sensitivity but they lose those settings when not on wink hub and wink died. They still retrigger quickly by default but I can’t set sensitivity at all.\n\nI want preferably Z-Wave or Zigbee since I also use Home Assistant but I’m not ruling out WiFi since my network is solid. \n\nIf you don’t have info on any wired then I’ll take advice on wireless as long as the batteries last a while. I have plenty lithium rechargeables and nimh. \n\nI do have HA but I kind of want something that works without the extra work. HA is great and all but to get it to work remotely is … no thanks. \n\nThanks!",

    "title": "Smart home Setup - internet issues",
    "selftext": "Thank you in advance for any ideas you hay have. \n\n\n\nI am trying to create a smarthome. I have zero tech background. I have read a lot of posts and guides, but I am hoping someone can help me understand. We use apple homekit with our apple TV on the ground floor as our base. We also have an apple TV on the 3rd floor but that isn't associated with the smart home as far as I can tell.\n\nSo far we have the following, which work very well:\n\nIndoor cameras: Eufy Indoor Cam E220, the cameras are accessible through the Eufy app only when at home with more functionality and through the Home app when away but without speaking options or zoom\n\nFront door lock: Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with Wi-Fi - Keyed – Entry – Deadbolt / Fingerprint and Wi-Fi / Satin Nickel, connection can be spotty, I use the yale app on my phone\n\nMitsubishi Electric split HVAC (?) on each level which runs heat or cold air. We use the Comfort app from Mitzubishi to control these and have no problems.\n\nEcobee thermostat on each floor which controls the radiator heat. This is only on in the winter and we control it from the ecobee app on our phones\n\n\n\nProblems: \n\n1) We are trying to install a smart doorbell on our outer yard gate - this would require strong wifi. We are also trying to install a smart lock on the outer yard gate but having issues with nothing being fully waterproof on the \"inside\" side. Best I have found is either the Level lock and crossing my fingers or using a \"dumb\" keypad lock and speaking the code to whoever is ringing through the doorbell.\n\n2) WIFI on the top floor works about 50% of the time. \n\n\n\n**Network**: We currently have spectrum internet. The modem is from spectrum. Our wifi router is TP link archer 1750. The plan reports a typical download speed of 475 mbps an upload 11 mbps.\n\n**Layout**: This is a small 3 story home, think one room on each level, so compact but somewhat tall. There is a separate coaxial cable from a ground level room (where our modem and router are located), up to each level, that we currently don't use/don't know how to use to our benefit. We own this home, so if changes need to be made we can make them within reason. \n\n\n\nI am not really comfortable with setting up hubs or work around codes, but could make some effort to make simple changes with specific, direct instructions. \n\n\n\nDo we need to switch to Verizon Fios? Or upgrade our spectrum plan? \n\nDo we need to have the coaxial cables in the home replaced with ethernet wires? \n\nDo I need a wifi router on each level? Mesh wifi? I read that using \"extenders\" isn't a real fix\n\nDo I need to wire a wifi router out into the yard to help connect the doorbell?\n\n  \nThank you for your patience with my limited understanding. Hopefully some of you have ideas for me!",

    "title": "Dark Apartment - need ideas / solutions",
    "selftext": "Hi! I am a smart home veteran. So I don't need the basics so that should help lol. This may seem basic but it's actually pretty nuanced. \n\nTLDR: im living in the dark, its making me feel crazy. I have windows, they are ineffective. I want to hear from other's solutions. Or theories / ideas on solutions and the actual brand / type of lights that might be best here.\n\nSEE IMAGES: This is a bright sunny day, in my living room. (the actual light well is at the bottom.\n\n[Living room full sun](https://preview.redd.it/3ty3vk4hivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00972b18b7f5febc001b53b3f3b595b18a42a6d9)\n\nSo here's my situation: I moved into a new apartment. I have windows. However I am located at the bottom of a so-called \"light well\". It's a smallish square courtyard made for lighting only. So all my windows face the light well (lies, its a dark well). However this is a 5 storey brick building. An old school. \n\nOf course I am at the bottom. The light barely reaches my windows. They are just a gloomy dark blue like its rainy outside, all day long, regardless of weather. It's really depressing. Literally, its causing depression like like living in the dark 24/7.\n\n  \nAlexa has some great routines based on Sunrise, Sunset, Raining, snowing. Which is almost perfect. However, I need a recommendation on the lights I can frame the inside of the window to simulate actual window light. It can be considered circadian rhythm but I want to set the colors myself.\n\nTo create depth I have window film that helps diffuse the light and has plants.\n\nThe problem is, ive tried multiple smart lights but i cannot seem to find the right set. The windows are large and overwhelming. I've thought of creating frames to insert into the window frame to cause a faux window look.\n\nI would also like to create a \"fake window\" to mount on the wall. I have an idea what i want to do  but it cannot be heavy due to apartment walls no damage.\n\nSo I need to know if anyone has any specific set of smart lights. In a string, rope or strip. Not bulb(s).\n\nHas anyone tackled a project like this? I need to stay here for a year and it literally feels like prison. Also my windows directly face everyone elses windows. So I cannot have them able to see through. Hence the window film.\n\nAlso maybe there is a solution that is meant for this specifically. Though I want them to represent the weather too. Sun, Cloudy, Rain, Snow. Sunrise, sunset, noon. All these conditions but one are able to be controlled by alexa.\n\nOk. Im done babbling, lol. I just need recommendations and ideas and hear from anyone who has had to solve a similar situation. Like maybe someone who lives in a basement apartmet?\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[The view from my living room window](https://preview.redd.it/y2hl1o7pivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baeb9367274817fb06d498974727b43c33ce0bf)\n\n[Full view up to the sky in the \\\\\"light well\\\\\" Its sunny up there. You can see how close i am to other windows, so i cannot even open the shades.](https://preview.redd.it/vc07ocnvivxf1.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7574025819a27829044edca167bcfbbbedecd2cf)\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I have a very simple heater my garage with an old-school thermostat.  I need to integrate this and have a Zooz Zen16 \"dry contact\" Multirelay to use but am unclear on how to actually wire the heater into this.  I have separate power inputs into the unit which is solved but I have 2 wires from the unit which don't make sense to me on how to connect them.  I have an R and W1 wire coming out of the unit where the R is 24VAC and the W1 turns on heat (single stage).  It seems to me that I am NOT supposed to use the 24VAC wire at all and the W1 wire would go into the relay as the signal?  Do I shunt the other leg of that relay connection pair (on the Zen16) to the ground of the power inputs to the Zen16?\n\nWould it be possible for someone to draw a simple wiring diagram and explain why it works?  I can do all of the other bits but translating from these 2 wires to something else seems to be breaking my brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anrjye1zgvxf1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=72379c7a66a60690a24cd86633780ac3f8fb97d8\n\n",

The biggest challenge we have had is because we are single zone, if we are downstairs and it's cold the heat pops on and all the hot air is upstairs. If it's hot, the ac will help us out. And then if we are upstairs in the evening and it's cold, we can warm up easily, but it's tougher to cool down.\n\nShort of adding in another zone or some other room specific solution, is there a smart thermostat that can help us with this situation a bit?

Can the courier/carrier see that I am using the camera on my doorbell to see who is ringing or not?)\n\nDoes anyone here know which company or brand offers and sells this type of doorbell that I am looking for?\n\nAs I said, I have looked around and it is complicated, so I really appreciate any help I can get!",

    "selftext": "There must be a way to fix this. I just replaced a years old Nest Hello (wired) doorbell camera with a new Nest wired 3rd Gen doorbell.  The old camera was installed and accessed with the Nest app.  The new one installed with the Goggle Home app.  I did not realize that the old camera had to be removed or deleted from the app before removing it physically from the front door.  And it now appears as one of my devices in the Goggle Home app.  Neither app can delete it, apparently because it is no longer powered.  The remove device menu item simply does not appear.   The old camera has a USB type connector on it and I used that to power it up.  The Goggle Home app tells me to use the Nest app to remove it.  The Nest app led me through a process that involved a factory reset.   Now it does not appear in the Nest app but still appears in the Goggle Home app.  Attempts to reinstall it in the Nest app fail.  I contacted Goggle support to ask if they can see my account or the database and delete it from their end.  They said “no” and that it needs to be deleted from the app.  So the situation is an (effectively) bricked camera that cannot be deleted from either app or by Goggle.  And it shows up in my devices on the Goggle Home app I just started using, cluttering the display.  Am I consigned to seeing this as long as I use Goggle Home?  I cannot believe that there is no way to remove this!  As many devices as they have sold, some must have failed without being removed from the app.  It seems inconceivable that Goggle would design the apps and software such that a bricked device cannot be removed from the app.  Any ideas what to do next?  Delete my entire Goggle account and start over with a new one?  Any advice is appreciated.  ",

    "selftext": "After that conversation with a fellow Redditor about bringnox smart shades, I ended up ordering six units this year. I've even started recommending them to my clients (yes, I do professional home installation). Here's my detailed experience:\n\nThe ordering form is well-organized with clear categories. I didn't trust screen colors for fabric selection at the beginning. Since I wanted to verify both color accuracy and texture, I ordered their fabric sample book before my first purchase. For anyone with similar concerns, the swatches are totally worth the small investment and so cheap.\n\nTheir measurement video guide is fantastic – I followed it precisely. I measured top/middle/bottom of the window frame and used the smallest dimension (to ensure the shade would fit).\nInstallation is DIY-friendly for anyone moderately handy. The process is straightforward, and I just do: mark level screw positions, drill pilot holes, secure two brackets with a screwdriver, and then it can click the shade into place. Maybe some prople is no need to find the professional helps.\n\nConnecting to my Alexa system was painless. Their instructions are wonderfully clear with minimal steps - maybe the most beginner-friendly setup I've seen.",

Im really happy to announce, that bluetti will officially launch a smart home plattform, that will allow people to use their favourite devices with Amazon Alexa, Google Home over a cloud connection and of course HomeAssistant over a local Wifi connection (Soon TM).\n\nCommunity Github projects that rely on bluetooth connection and reversed engeneered Modus Registers can be replaced by a more reliable (and like to mentioned it again... LOCAL) Wifi connection.\n\nFor now, there are a few devices that are already fully integratet such as the new Fridge Power or the Home Energy Solutions like EP6K, EP13K and EP2000.\n\nIn active development is the Apex 300 and all the Elite V2 Powerstations.\n\nThey release a first version of the plugin on their github:\n\n[https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant)\n\nFeel free to ask me any question and i try my very best to answer all of them! Also would appreaciate if you tell me, which devices should be support in the future in your opinion\n\nHere is a little Q&A i did with the guys at Bluetti:\n\n**1. Q: Is the current integration with third-party platforms (Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant) done via cloud API bridge or local network communication (MQTT or WebSocket)?**\n\nA: Currently, it's done through the cloud.\n\n**2. Q: If it's cloud-based, is there a plan to support local integration in the future (e.g., LAN direct connection, MQTT broker)?**\n\nA: Yes, there are plans to support local integration via Bluetooth or local network.\n\n**3. Q: Will you provide API or MQTT documentation (developer access / SDK)?**\n\nA: We already have this available and it will be released on the BLUETTI developer platform, which will launch in November 2025.\n\n**4. Q: Do you support third-party developers for secondary development (e.g., Home Assistant custom integration)?**\n\nA: Yes, we support this. Our source code is available on GitHub for anyone to access (currently, cloud-to-cloud integration is available, and local integration is still in development).\n\n**5. Q: Do you plan to establish a developer portal or testing channel?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI developer platform will serve as our developer portal, launching in November 2025. We will share the portal link after launch.\n\nWe also have our official community on GitHub, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\n\n**6. Q: Do you plan to allow older Wi-Fi-enabled devices to support this platform through a firmware update?**\n\nA: Technically, it's possible. Could you specify which old models you are referring to? We can pass your request on to the product manager for further consideration.\n\n**Q: Are there any devices that don’t support Wi-Fi but can be adapted via a gateway or module?**\n\nA: Bluetooth integration with Home Assistant is possible, and this feature is still in development.\n\n**8. Q: What main functions does the current smart platform support? (e.g., reading status, controlling switches, mode switching, etc.)**\n\nA:\n\nCheck SOC (State of Charge)\n\nCheck device status (home storage)\n\nCheck remaining runtime settings\n\nAC/DC switch (for portable storage only)\n\nWork mode settings\n\nECO mode (for portable storage only)\n\nDisaster warning switch\n\nSystem shutdown\n\n**9. Q: Are the features equivalent to those in the BLUETTI app, or are there limitations?**\n\nA: The BLUETTI app has more and more comprehensive features. If you need additional features to be reflected in the smart platform, feel free to share your feedback with us.\n\n**10. Q: Can it be expanded to energy management (e.g., power regulation, load control)?**\n\nA: Power control can be done via the app, but voice assistants have difficulty understanding the semantic interactions involved in power regulation.\n\n**11. Q: Are there any extra account binding or subscription fees required?**\n\nA: Currently, there are no additional fees.\n\n**12. Q: Is there a release timeline (e.g., official version, Beta plan, regional rollout plan)?**\n\nA: Some models and features are already live:\n\nThe fridge power station, EP6K, EP13K, and EP2000 are already available.\n\nThe upcoming models include Elite100/200/AP300, but the specific prioritization of models depends on evaluations from the frontend business side.\n\nRegards  \nErik",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been deep in the smart lock rabbit hole lately and, man… there are way too many options out there. Every brand swears theirs is “THE SMARTEST”... but half of them just seem like more stuff to babysit... lol.\n\nHere’s what I actually want: A keypad for PIN entry The ability to unlock using my iPhone, Apple Watch, or another smartphone A physical key backup (optional) And it would also be a bonus if it supports fingerprint unlocking or includes video features, but those aren’t essential. Seems simple, right? Yeah, nope.\n\nOnce I start comparing them, it’s like: Wi-Fi locks are convenient but chew through batteries like crazy. Also when AWS sneezes, half the world’s “smart homes” catch a cold. Bluetooth ones are fine for short range, but remote access usually still needs the cloud (kinda defeats the point). Zigbee / Z-Wave locks are solid if you’re running Home Assistant, but the setup is a bit “nerd level 3000”... Some need an extra hub, others make you go through Alexa just to get HA to see it.\n\nI even read someone saying their August lock needs to talk to the cloud first before Bluetooth key sharing works .. like… what’s the point then lol?\n\nAnyway, I’m starting to think Z-Wave LR might be the sweet spot. Longer range, low power, still local...? And some of the new models have fingerprint unlock and key backup, which feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nMy biggest fear is the classic one: battery dies + no key = locked out and standing on your porch like an idiot. So yeah, if anyone’s found a setup that just works, eliable, local, not eating batteries, please drop your recs. I’m cool with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, whatever, as long as it doesn’t depend on the cloud to open my own door.",

The only way to add a switch is by using IFTTT. How do I do this? I’ve only set IFTTT rules on my phone, but this would be an IFTTT rule between two devices in my flat not using my phone.

I don’t have any smart switches right now might add later on but don’t want to deal with wiring right now. \n\nI’m specifically looking for bulbs for my living room fan (not smart). I’d like to be able to turn on/off the bulbs via HomeKit without getting up to flip the switch. I also don’t know if that fan is dimmable but would like it to. \n\nAlso how do smart bulbs work I’d want to shut off all 3 bulbs on the fan at once can I do this or can you only do it individually?",

For some of the stuff is quite easy with zigbee and all this radio protocols. Even Wi-Fi mostly works. However I reached a problem.\n\nI've been doing some research regarding the AC units. Due to no duct installation, using split units is the realistic only option. However after some research most of the existing automations are done through the AC unit cloud platform (and that is what I want to avoid). Has someone faced this same issue?   \n  \nI thought about IR blasters but its not practical to add it to all rooms (I would need to configure it room by room) and the biggest issue is that the IR blaster doesn't get information back from the unit in terms of configured temperature or on/off status.",

    "selftext": "After that conversation with a fellow Redditor about bringnox smart shades, I ended up ordering six units this year. I've even started recommending them to my clients (yes, I do professional home installation). Here's my detailed experience:\n\nThe ordering form is well-organized with clear categories. I didn't trust screen colors for fabric selection at the beginning. Since I wanted to verify both color accuracy and texture, I ordered their fabric sample book before my first purchase. For anyone with similar concerns, the swatches are totally worth the small investment and so cheap.\n\nTheir measurement video guide is fantastic – I followed it precisely. I measured top/middle/bottom of the window frame and used the smallest dimension (to ensure the shade would fit).\nInstallation is DIY-friendly for anyone moderately handy. The process is straightforward, and I just do: mark level screw positions, drill pilot holes, secure two brackets with a screwdriver, and then it can click the shade into place. Maybe some prople is no need to find the professional helps.\n\nConnecting to my Alexa system was painless. Their instructions are wonderfully clear with minimal steps - maybe the most beginner-friendly setup I've seen.",

What can I do to properly diagnose or fix it?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips!\n",

Tried restarting multiple times, nothing happened, turns out the driver Intel Wireless Ac9462 had a yellow triangle next to it that (Code 10) I spent a lot of time fixing.\n\nThere is no hardware issue because in Powershell when i type out get-pnpdevice etc., it shows the wireless AC device and in the problem secriom it says \"RT\" (reboot required but nothing happens after a reboot)\n\nI:\n\n1)installed the intel drivers that were uptodate for my version of the AC, it said \"repair\" on the exe file. chatgpt kept telling me to run a powershell command to extract the inf files from the installer and install through powershell but it didnt work\n\n2)removed every oemxx.inf that were associated with this, so that when i ran the command in powershell to search for the string netwtw (or something like that), it returned no results. at this point it was supposed to have no wireless adapter driver installed in it anywhere, so I tried installing that same exe again and it said repair again but nothing got fixed.\n\n3)may have deleted some extra oem drivers before realizing that I was supposed to delete the \"wifi/wireless\" ones. not sure what i deleted and idk how fucked i am.\n\n4)downloaded an older version of the driver and that had an error saying there was a newer version available\n\n5)Tried uninstalling the driver from device manager but it kept reappearing with the same issue with the same name.\n\n 5)Reset my entire PC with a local install of Windows (since i had no internet to do a cloud install), after resetting windows 11 had a block on installation where i had to install a driver to get through it, i ended up using cmd to bypass it and then on the desktop tried installing the same driver again, it succeeded and said it had been installed but still showed the same yellow triangle and no internet. netwtw08.inf was installed which i cant change to netwtw12.inf which is supported for my laptop since its blocked behind that exe file that i cant extract since its a GUi. (i dont have 7zip or winrar anymore, i guess i can try moving the setup for 7zip into my laptop and hope that extracts the exe somehow)\n\n6)searched up on chatgpt and it told me to downlod 4 drivers (Chipset, serial io, MEI, and Wireless lan) from the asus website, and i installed them in the correct order it told me to but still it had no effect\n\n7)went to registry editor to delete some UpperLimit values and LowerLimit values (names might be different since i cannot remember thhem) nothing changed despite that\n\nmy only option i have left is to get a cloud install of windows on a harddrive (or some boot menu thing im not sure) to then reset my laptop through that which im not even sure will work or not. if anyone has ANY idea and can help me in ANY way id appreciate it so much",

    "selftext": "My PC is still on Windows 10, and ran Microsoft's PC health checker app to see if I was compatible for Windows 11. The only thing it said was missing was Secure Boot, so I tried a quick search on that and saw it was a setting in the BIOS.\n\nNow I definitely should have done some more research before jumping in, but decided to try it. Went to the BIOS (Gigabyte MB), changed CSM support from Enabled to Disabled, went to Secure Boot and set it to Enabled. I did notice it said Enabled, Not Active at first. Couldn't seem to change that so I just went to Save and Exit. Afterwards it reset....and brought me right back to BIOS. I see CSM is still disabled, and now Secure Boot shows Enabled and Active, but every time I exit I go back to BIOS.\n\nI tried looking some more things up at this point and see that this might be due to my install being on MBR. Okay, I'll just switch back to CSM and see if I can do something about that...except when I set CSM back to Enabled and Save and Exit it is also just taking me back to BIOS. And each time I come in CSM is disabled again. If I go to the Secure Boot menu now it is Enabled and Active still, but I also can't change it anymore.\n\nSo I seem to be completely stuck now - can't go back to CSM or forwards with Secure Boot. Any advice for how I can get out of this?",

Recently i came home for the weekend and i booted it up and after a few hours it completely crashed and now it doesn’t work the same. One of the hdmi ports for my monitors doesn’t work, and it can hardly run anything. It can’t run any games, and it’s noticeably slower with any browsers or other apps. I genuinely have no clue why this happened, it seems entirely random. I haven’t changed any of the hardware since last september. The only thing i can think of is a few months ago i experimented with putting it in my dorm, i set it up, realized it wasn’t worth it, then took it back home and set it back up but that was a few months ago at this point. It seemingly wasn’t affected until i guess right now. Mind you this crash happened about two days ago. Anyways, i understand looking for solutions is kinda unrealistic, but if anyone could maybe explain what happened or theorize about what the issue is i would greatly appreciate it. I assume it’s a hardware issue but im hardly a techie, treat me like a novice with this stuff. ",

I was a little disappointed. I decided to run a CineBench R20 test, and immediately, in a split second, the processor began thermal throttling to 98+ degrees Celsius, and it stayed that way until the end of the test. The room temperature was 26°C. I tried three modes: Balanced and Performance modes, and throttling skyrocketed. In Silent mode, it was around 80+/-, but hwinfo says the power limit for the package has been exceeded. What could be the cause? Insufficient cooling.

    "selftext": "Hello!\nI have been having issues with my Samsung TV randomly turning off. Sometimes it will turn back on but not always. There isn't a consistent pattern with it turning off either, sometimes it'll be fine for hours, sometimes it'll turn off every couple minutes.\nI have checked the remote batteries (they're fine) and I have tried power cycling and resetting the TV. None of that works for long. I dont have this issue with my old monitor (I tested it to see if it was a computer setting) so it's gotta be something with the TV right?\n\nI think I have narrowed it down to an issue with the HDMI inputs, but I'm not sure where to go from there.\nThe power issue only happens when something is plugged into the HDMI inputs and is on. This applies to both my PC and my Xbox, both HDMI 1 & 2 inputs on the TV. When I unplug the on electronic when the TV turns off, it'll turn back on again.\n\nIt's not a smart TV if that helps narrow down any solutions. It's been frustrating and I don't want to buy a new TV if I don't have to. Also if I used the wrong tag or am in the wrong subreddit, please let me know what the correct one is. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Basically what it says.  Every time I connect my laptop to my house's WiFi, the entire signal goes down for the house.  It also happens at various times, but only when I'm on my laptop.  We just upgraded a couple months ago between companies (Consolidated to Fidium, if that makes a difference), but had fiber the whole time.  The only difference would be the company servicing it.\n\nWe've had Fidium out and they replaced the router, the box that connects to the outside lines, and most recently, a tech created a relay between the router and the old cable running in the house form the connection box, and did the same for the connection box.  Nothing has helped.  The tech said if the cable was bad, there would be no signal.  They've also stated that our signal is good from the street.\n\nAll the devices on the system are the same as before, no settings have been changed.\n\nWould a signal booster help?  My laptop is in the dining room, a hallway away from the router?  Does my connecting, or use overload the signal?  Why would it change now, when we've just changed companies, and not service?\n\nThanks for any help.  It's getting frustrating because I can't use my laptop if my husband is working from home because he's been kicked out of meetings.\n\nETA: I have run both CCleaner and Malwarebytes with no problems found.",

Unfortunately the first few times I used it, I did not power off my computer after using it and it died. I let it die (by accident) a few times over the past several weeks. Now, I am having an issue of my laptop freezing. It does not seem to do it when it's plugged in. I installed an update today that apparently needed to be installed to see if that solved the freezing problem, but it has frozen a couple of times tonight since. it seems like the only thing helping is keeping it plugged in? btw its at 90%.\n\nHave I completely messed up my laptop?? I have read some things about maybe its RAM or hard drive problem or something else.

One day i heard a loud slam and I came to check it out, there I found him on the home screen - he explained that he “slammed on the keyboard” and the screen “went all weird, like black with some colours in a corner”. He explained how he forced the power off and turned the device back on and all was good. Since then, my laptop has been performing pretty sub-par, at least compared to how it was/ should be. Things like lower frame rates (about 80 fps on games like minecraft, where before i could comfortably run them at a over 100) and on most games the display and audio would constantly stutter, making for an extremely annoying experience. Another thing is that windows seem to not update right, like It’d only update the areas I move my mouse over, though these happenings typically fix themselves or are easily fixed by minimising and reopening the window. Something pretty concerning happened today as well - the right of my screen flashed with blues and pinks for a couple moments before stopping. This laptop was a gift and it’s fairly new, I know these things don’t really have the option for swapping out parts and I’m asking if anyone knows what i could possibly do to fix this?",

(i dont have 7zip or winrar anymore, i guess i can try moving the setup for 7zip into my laptop and hope that extracts the exe somehow)\n\n6)searched up on chatgpt and it told me to downlod 4 drivers (Chipset, serial io, MEI, and Wireless lan) from the asus website, and i installed them in the correct order it told me to but still it had no effect\n\n7)went to registry editor to delete some UpperLimit values and LowerLimit values (names might be different since i cannot remember thhem) nothing changed despite that\n\nmy only option i have left is to get a cloud install of windows on a harddrive (or some boot menu thing im not sure) to then reset my laptop through that which im not even sure will work or not. if anyone has ANY idea and can help me in ANY way id appreciate it so much",

The only thing it said was missing was Secure Boot, so I tried a quick search on that and saw it was a setting in the BIOS.\n\nNow I definitely should have done some more research before jumping in, but decided to try it. Went to the BIOS (Gigabyte MB), changed CSM support from Enabled to Disabled, went to Secure Boot and set it to Enabled. I did notice it said Enabled, Not Active at first. Couldn't seem to change that so I just went to Save and Exit. Afterwards it reset....and brought me right back to BIOS. I see CSM is still disabled, and now Secure Boot shows Enabled and Active, but every time I exit I go back to BIOS.\n\nI tried looking some more things up at this point and see that this might be due to my install being on MBR. Okay, I'll just switch back to CSM and see if I can do something about that...except when I set CSM back to Enabled and Save and Exit it is also just taking me back to BIOS. And each time I come in CSM is disabled again. If I go to the Secure Boot menu now it is Enabled and Active still, but I also can't change it anymore.\n\nSo I seem to be completely stuck now - can't go back to CSM or forwards with Secure Boot. Any advice for how I can get out of this?",

After encountering problems, I've already tried the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n\\- Restarted my router/modem\n\n\\- Restarted my PC\n\n\\- Uninstalled the Epic Games Launcher completely\n\n\n\nHowever, now when I try to reinstall the launcher, the installation is failing. \n\n\n\nDoes anyone have information about when this might be resolved? Has anyone else successfully managed to install or restart the launcher recently? Any help or insights would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

It’s been moved around and all that but 90% of the time it’s in my room at home, mostly unused because i’m a freshman in college and i don’t have the space for it in my dorm. Recently i came home for the weekend and i booted it up and after a few hours it completely crashed and now it doesn’t work the same. One of the hdmi ports for my monitors doesn’t work, and it can hardly run anything. It can’t run any games, and it’s noticeably slower with any browsers or other apps. I genuinely have no clue why this happened, it seems entirely random. I haven’t changed any of the hardware since last september. The only thing i can think of is a few months ago i experimented with putting it in my dorm, i set it up, realized it wasn’t worth it, then took it back home and set it back up but that was a few months ago at this point. It seemingly wasn’t affected until i guess right now. Mind you this crash happened about two days ago. Anyways, i understand looking for solutions is kinda unrealistic, but if anyone could maybe explain what happened or theorize about what the issue is i would greatly appreciate it. I assume it’s a hardware issue but im hardly a techie, treat me like a novice with this stuff. ",

The new one worked for a while without issue as well. I don't remember installing any new software or updates that might have triggered the change.\n\nI was playing a game and my screen went black. The computer remained on and I had to hold the power button down to shut it off, then hit the power button again to turn it back on.\n\nI've tested in several games. I've changed to DX11 and DX12 in games where that's relevant. The issue does not appear to be an overheating or panicking GPU, because I have it set to an efficiency-oriented preset in Adrenalin. And more to the point, one of the games it's frozen in was Balatro.\n\nThe most recent episode, I was just browsing, and MY TV SHUT OFF AND RESTARTED ITSELF, and my PC was frozen afterward.\n\nTroubleshooting I've tried:\n\n* Confirmed it happens in multiple games with multiple settings, including low-power games like Balatro.\n* Uninstalled and reinstalled Adrenalin.\n* Reseat one RAM stick.\n* Checked that GPU drivers and chipset drivers are updated.\n* Updated the BIOS.\n* Opened Event Viewer to look for clues - but I'm too stupid to be able to make sense of what I see.\n* Attempted to log performance in Adrenalin, but found nothing unusual in the logs that were saved.\n* Unplugged the HDMI and replugged it, in both the mobo output and the GPU output.\n* \"Fix problems using Windows Update\" to reinstall the OS.\n\n  \nI could stand to go through and check every plug on the machine, though I don't know what would have changed from when it was working.\n\nHelp appreciated!",

    "title": "AMD Ryzen™ 5 5600T missing CPU driver on the official website",
    "selftext": "I built my PC around 4 months ago and decided to go with a Ryzen 5 5600T because I got a good deal from a retailer. When I set it up, I didn't have any issues with the drivers. However, after sending my mainboard back to the manufacturer, I had to rebuild my PC from scratch and had to reinstall and check up on the drivers of all my components upon finishing. That's when I noticed that I couldn't find the official drivers on the AMD website, and even the automatic driver diagnosing tool has an error. But it works, and I didn't have a problem until now, but I wonder if I could get better gaming performance and better security if I had updated drivers. I also tried to send the support an email, but I didn't receive an answer back or any indication if the support form on AMD's website sent it off.\n\nI'd appreciate any help regarding this topic\n\nLinks:  \n[https://www.amd.com/de/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/5000-series/amd-ryzen-5-5600t.html](https://www.amd.com/de/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/5000-series/amd-ryzen-5-5600t.html) (my CPU)\n\n[https://www.amd.com/de/support/download/drivers.html](https://www.amd.com/de/support/download/drivers.html) (AMD driver website, I checked multiple times and tried searching on the site with the browser on site search function)\n\n  \n[https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B550-EAGLE-WIFI6/support#support-cpu](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B550-EAGLE-WIFI6/support#support-cpu) (my mainboard, the CPU is listed as compatible)",

What can I do to properly diagnose or fix it?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips!\n",

    "selftext": "Does anyone know why my laptop keyboard frequently doesn’t work? I’ve had the HP pink inch 14 laptop for awhile and not even long after the keyboard just randomly stops working. I got it fixed by going to a repairer but even so later on it went back to the same issue. It’s so frustrating.",
