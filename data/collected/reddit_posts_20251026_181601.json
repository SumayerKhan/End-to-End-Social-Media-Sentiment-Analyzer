    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I‚Äôd like to share the app I‚Äôve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI‚Äôve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn‚Äôt an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn‚Äôt have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies.¬†\n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I‚Äôm also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I‚Äôm actively looking for ideas to improve it.¬†\n\nThank you!¬†",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

I‚Äôd like to share the app I‚Äôve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI‚Äôve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn‚Äôt an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn‚Äôt have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies.¬†\n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I‚Äôm also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I‚Äôm actively looking for ideas to improve it.¬†\n\nThank you!¬†",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It‚Äôs been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi y‚Äôall, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with¬†[Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn‚Äôt support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you‚Äôve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

I‚Äôd like to share the app I‚Äôve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI‚Äôve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn‚Äôt an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn‚Äôt have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies.¬†\n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I‚Äôm also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I‚Äôm actively looking for ideas to improve it.¬†\n\nThank you!¬†",

Thinking I may have an issue outside of the phone, I ran the same check on a SE 2022 and it worked perfectly.\n\nAny thoughts as to what may be going on here? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezliduhmzgxf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc0d3706b8aaa7088e52424e9c543b0846949898\n\n  \n",

Now I have a base 17 with a G9Q display which again is noticeably warmer at the top when True Tone or/and night shift is on. Disable them and this screen appears ok but why?

Eventualy i found ways and yesterday i was just watching tiktok when my phone strated randomly touching everywhere on the screen whenever i clicked my screen. Also if i take off my protector glass the touch on the phone doesnt work. Its a little usable when i turn it on but after 30 seconds its just unusable, i cant swipe because it just starts clicking eweryvhere.",

As the mini did not last more than 12 hours I have been using a Galaxy S23 for 6 weeks up until now. \n\nWhere I was extremely thrilled to be finally using a ProMotion 120Hz display, it got me dissatisfied very quickly. I cant help but notice micro stuttering while scrolling. And once seen.....both the mini in 60hz and the S23 do not stutter at all. \n\nThe second thing about scrolling is that is still feels quite slow. Compared to the S23 which is insanely quick and a bit too snappy, the iPhone still feels slow and quite the same as the mini. \n\nI wonder if it has something to do with the background processes and indexing as this is a new phone but I read a lot of complaints that this is due to dynamic resolution adaptation and can not be fixed. \n\nAnyone who has an iPhone 17 knows if this will get better?

Apparently I cannot do it in IPhone. A very big disappointment for me. \n2. The phone is heavy. My finger hurts! I need to change the way I used to hold my phone. For the context, I am 180cm, 80 kilo, white-collar only person. \n3. I need to spend time on learning the OS. I was not expecting it. I take it as a feature, not a problem though. OS feels very polished compared to stock Android.\n4. Flares are a thing in night-shots. But I can live with it.\n5. Battery life is very good.\n6. The default font configuration in some apps (e.g. Facebook) are difficult to read for those wearing reading glasses. \n",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

And I haven‚Äôt missed the telephoto lens as of yet.\n\nI love the green colour and my wife‚Äôs blue is close to her blue 13 Pro and she‚Äôs also really happy with it.\n\nAll in all, no regrets - best regular iPhone (value wise) to date. Especially with the basic storage being up with the same price.\n\nAs for my personal feelings towards the pro phones - a bit too utilitarian with limited colour choices, while the Air is too limited for the price and posing as premium.",

Holy shit what the FUCK happened? \n\nI have an iPhone 15 pro and I gotta say, iOS 26 made this thing suck so much. I get actively pissed off daily trying to do simple things that never gave me issues before. \n\nTyping is ABYSMAL. How did they make it so fucking awful when it was literally the best in class since it was first released? Not only is the predictive text dogshit but the actual selection of keys got NOTICEABLY worse. I am constantly having to go back to fix letters. Used to be able to miss a letter or hit the wrong one and it would correct the word ACCURATELY. Now sometimes it will either leave the typo or INcorrect the word. \n\nSiri was never good but oh my god now it‚Äôs going to make me throw my phone out the window. Today while on a walk, I asked Siri to play ‚ÄúThe Jones‚Äù by Pile and no matter where I asked, my phone, my watch or my AirPods, all gave me the wrong song. My watch transcribed my request accurately and STILL gave me the wrong song. Twice. Open Spotify and the correct song is right there in the playlist where it‚Äôs always been. \n\nI am seriously thinking of giving Android a try at this point. Anyone else make that move and have any insights? ",

    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre‚Äôs report clearly mentioned ‚ÄúDisplay ‚Äì step mark on display.‚Äù\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called ‚Äúflagship quality‚Äù completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care ‚Äî never dropped, always in Samsung‚Äôs original case and protector ‚Äî yet the display failed twice. It‚Äôs shocking how a premium device costing nearly ‚Çπ1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite ‚Äî big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you‚Äôre left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand‚Äôs promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point üòÖ, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol üòÖ)",

I let AI create a table given Xreals Project Aura glasses (AR-Glasses) that will run android XR.

Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed.

    "title": "Android Verified Boot and the Bootloader Unlock Security Theater",
    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

    "selftext": "It's too much of a coincidence that ONEPLUS has not only downgraded the camera specs but also ditched Hassleblad partnership while OPPO is going all out with strong focus on camera and overall specs/features with the Find X9 series. Oneplus could have just as easily kept the same camera hardware in OP15 as OP13 which would have been good enough for 2026 with proper tuning but they didn't.\n\nAlso, from the display specs the focus is mostly on performance and high refresh rates now.\n\nOneplus flagships are known for VFM with balanced specs but from now on I think the focus is shifting towards to performance/gaming so basically it's minus -1 point from the camera department and +1 point in the performance department.\n\nI strongly believe, from now on ONEPLUS is likely to become a gaming orientated brand and OPPO will be the main balanced brand like IQOO and VIVO, POCO/REDMI and XIAOMI.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: Appending the camera downgrade info below\n\nMain camera: LYT 808 ‚Üí LYT 700 (same as Nord5)\n\nTelephoto: OV64B ‚Üí JN5",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre‚Äôs report clearly mentioned ‚ÄúDisplay ‚Äì step mark on display.‚Äù\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called ‚Äúflagship quality‚Äù completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care ‚Äî never dropped, always in Samsung‚Äôs original case and protector ‚Äî yet the display failed twice. It‚Äôs shocking how a premium device costing nearly ‚Çπ1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite ‚Äî big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you‚Äôre left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand‚Äôs promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "selftext": "you started to see some actions which knowing that google will block sideloading of non certified apps now make sense. \n\nAmazon is killing Fire OS, Fire OS is based in android 9 to 11 but they are replacing it with Vega OS on their streaming devices (which is absolte crap, its basically a OS for remote apps) and some appliances, while at the same time declaring that a new Amazon tablet will be out in 2026 with Androidn 16, meaning that that the main point of contention with Google was blocking sideloading so people could stop using their devices as general media devices instead of amazon media consumption devices.\n\nWe also had Oppo (and other BBK brands) Xiaomi and Samsung saying they would break away from the GMS ecosystem at some times, Samsung is the most advance with their accesories using Tizen instead of Android or Wear OS and having their own samsung pay service separated from Google wallet.\n\nso those details all coming togather brings us to looking it from 2 different points. \n\nAre the brands who make android based devices pressuing google to close their ecosystem and now that google has agreed we are seeing companies like Amazon allowing GMS in to their devices again (even if its just tablets).\n\nOr Google is using 3rd party vendors as an excuse to close their ecosystem, i know google  went from \"dont be evil\" to \"we are evil in person\" but i think this is a culmination of years of pressure from inside and outside google to become more like an iphone and close the system. \n\nwhats your opinion on the matter ?",

    "title": "Android Verified Boot and the Bootloader Unlock Security Theater",
    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

I have Google Home with camera notifications and cradlewise for baby notifications and all the notifications are delayed. Often I would unlock the phone and see a flurry of notifications from Google Home about camera activity popping up. Funny enough, these notifications are not time stamped to when the phone was unlocked, but when the event happened. So it is super common for a Google Home notification to pop up with 30 mins ago written on it. Same happens with other apps too. \n\nI have turned off the adaptive battery, have the Google Home and other apps allowed unrestricted access to battery, but nothing seems to work. I had a Pixel 8a and a Pixel 7 before this and never had the issue on them. \n\nNot sure if it is a faulty device or a software bug. ",

It is specifically designed to connect to the Charging Speaker Dock and uses a unique pin configuration and internal circuitry known only to the tablet and the official dock.\nGeneric Specification: The cable you are considering is a generic 7.62mm 4-pin adapter designed for a wide range of small, low-power devices like smart watches, children's bracelets, and specific trackers (as mentioned in the reviews). The fact that the pins may look like they align does not mean the electrical connections (the pinout) will match the tablet's requirements.\nRisk of Damage: Attempting to charge a device with a non-compatible connector, even if it physically aligns, can potentially lead to no charge, slow charge, or in a worst-case scenario, damage to the device's internal charging circuitry.\nFor charging your Google Pixel Tablet, you should rely on the standard USB-C port or the official Google Charging Speaker Dock.\nthe end, your question was: Could this connector be used to charge my Google pixel 11-in tablet from the rear? The pins look like they will work and align",

That‚Äôs clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.\n\nSo I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That‚Äôs when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn‚Äôt an authorized reseller, even though it‚Äôs literally listed on Google‚Äôs official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google‚Äôs warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone‚Äôs internal system logs to verify that it hadn‚Äôt been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that ‚Äî the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google‚Äôs own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers. Passing the blame is not just lazy ‚Äî it‚Äôs unacceptable.\n\nThis whole experience has been absurd.\n\nTL;DR:\nBought a new Google phone from O2 (authorized reseller).\nGoogle‚Äôs system says it was bought 5 months earlier ‚Üí shortened warranty.\nGoogle checked the phone logs remotely and confirmed it hadn‚Äôt been used before purchase ‚Üí still refused to fix the warranty.\nSupport keeps giving false info and closing the case.\n\nHas anyone else in the EU had a wrong purchase date or shortened warranty on a new Google phone?

I used to have bedtime mode set up that it would then on when I plugged my phone in at night (which is when I was going to sleep) and then it would start in bedtime mode until a) my alarm went off or b) I unplugged my phone. This meant on weekends my phone would stay silent until I woke up and unplugged it myself.\nSince I updated my phone this week, bedtime mode will now turn itself off after the alarm time as that is when it says my \"night time\" ends, even if my phone is still plugged in and has not been touched. This means as soon as I get a notification on a weekend morning, I wake up and my precious lie in is ruined.\nAny one else having the same issue and any idea how to fix this? Thanks!",

The Nest Thermostat had a discount applied since my existing Nest went obsolete\n\nOn August 21, 2025 I received a discount code for \"10% off a purchase.\" Rather than cancel my order which hadn't yet shipped, and replace the order with the discount code, I reached out to customer service to see if they could retroactively apply.\n\nCustomer service told me the following:\n\n11:49:06‚ÄØAM (me): Ok, so to be clear - once the entire order arrives (the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro), you want me to reach back out to the Google Support chat and share the coupon code, and then you'll apply the code to the order price after it's been delivered?\n11:50:15‚ÄØAM Robertson: Yes, exactly. that is correct. we are also informed by our support on that (my name), rather than cancelling the order and apply the code, its much more a hassle in our customers end as per our support team\n11:50:42‚ÄØAM Robertson: no worries once you contacted us back we can consult the case so the code will be applied\n11:52:02‚ÄØAM (me): Yeah it seems like a pain to cancel / re-order. And can you confirm that the 10% will be applied to both the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro? I did have some rebates / offers on these items that were applied (such as being a Google Fi customer), but wanted to make sure the 10% is still applicable on top of those discounts\n11:54:35‚ÄØAM Robertson: Oh yes, the 10% discount it will be applicable on top of those discounts (my name) no worries \n\n\nBecause of this, I didn't cancel and replace the order. \n\nHad I done so, I at least would have separated the order into two orders - and gotten the discount on the Nest for one order, and the discount on my phone (an extra $100 off) on the other.\n\nNow after TWO MONTHS of back and forth with customer service, I keep getting told that Google won't apply the discount like the original customer service agent guaranteed me they would. Google has effectively cheated me out of over $100.\n\nAll of their responses ignore the original interaction I had, including the most recent one:\n\nThank you for contacting the Google Support Team regarding your order. We sincerely apologize for the delay in our response and truly appreciate your patience during this review period.\n\nOur specialist team has thoroughly reviewed your request to apply an additional promotional code to your order. We regret to inform you that we cannot accommodate this request.\n\nWe understand this outcome is disappointing, and we want to sincerely apologize for any confusion or frustration this may have caused.\n\nOur higher support team confirmed that a prior promotion‚Äîthe Nest Learning Thermostat upgrade promotion‚Äîwas already utilized on the existing order where you wished to apply the new code. As per our terms of service, only one promotional code or discount can be applied per order. This policy prevents us from stacking multiple discounts onto a single purchase.\n\nWe recognize the frustration of not being able to use the additional discount, and we truly apologize for this policy constraint.\n\nIf you have any further questions, or if you need assistance exploring other ways to save on a future purchase, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nThanks!\nCed\nThe Google Support Team\n\n\nThere have been over 20 interactions back and forth, all of them ignore what the first agent told me. Anyone else go through this before?",

    "selftext": "Well, I have been searching for this specific issue all over the internet to see if this is a common issue or not, but I couldn't find anything anywhere, so I guess I was the only lucky guy to experience this.\nA week ago, I was at a Barber üíà shop with my friend, and I really like to take photos anywhere I go, so we did take some really good pictures for each other using my Pixel 10. I then realized that all the photos I take are in the processing state for too long(never end for first photo), but I didn't think too much, and we keep on taking photos regardless of the last photos being in the processing state. Long story short, after our excellent barber done his job, I took some mirror selfie and would like to post it on my Facebook, but the photos are (still) processing. I then looked at the file names by chance and saw \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxxxx.jpg\" for these photos, oh yeah, may be my photos are so good that tensor G5 needs more time, I wonder. \nBut I really want to upload that mirror selfie on my Facebook, I couldn't wait more. So I did the most dumbest decision, I restarted my phone, just that the processing would start again and fix. But guess what and to my surprise, after restarting the phone, all of these previous \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxx.jpg\" were gone in thin air, I couldn't find it on photos, cloud, not on the trash. I really didn't believe that Google might have that kind of problem, so I waited, I tried taking another photos and these seem to become normal with their processing time being normal (1-3 sec) back again. But yet, the photos at the barber shop never came back. This is just my experience sharing about that and still no hate for Pixel (had been a fan since Nexus), but I think they might include some mitigation for this kind of situation, for example, at least saving the Non- processed photos on device or some kind of fail safe feature. \nBut yeah, this was the only time I've experienced this, and so far it's still working as expected. I hope this doesn't come again. Evidence? No, I really didn't think that kind of thing would ever happen, so no screenshot nor nothing was recorded.\n",

However Google support are stuck in a process loop where they insist that I provide a PDF copy of a repair order, which the company who did the repair cannot provide, as their system does not output PDFs.

Also, I don't have a 'google authorized' service center in my country. Honestly, this sure looks to me like they got a little too impatient to wait for the planned obsolescense to kick in, and the battery issue was just too easy of an opportunity to force a purchase from a ton of customers, so I'm out. Bye bye, damn shame as I liked your phones, but you are an awful, soulless company anyways, so I'm moving on.\n\nThat said, I'm not one who particularly trusts tech, but I (like all of use) haven't had much choice in going along with the integration of it in our lives, and given the amount of information our devices now carry and as they literally serve as primary sources of identity confirmation, I'm not happy to be pushed to have to switch devices sooner than I'd like. Transferring from the 5 to the 6 was fine; as I recall, a pretty seamless transfer. Going from a Pixel to a different manufacturer? I've not had any experience with that, so I'm hoping to avoid any sort of deluge of idiotic, innane problems like the ones I've seen reported in this sub (locked out of google account etc.).\n\nWhat would be the best manufacturer to graduate to with minimal conflict? I'm not tech-incapable, I simply do not trust the level of intrustion/dependence on it in our lives, and thus things like this make me nervous af. I'd prefer as seamless experience as possible, so any advice or suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

I got used to the issues in thermals, battery, and bad modems. I accepted it's flaws and moved on, the camera was great so no biggie right.\n\nThen the Pixel 10 impressions started coming in and it was honestly disheartening, I been looking forward to that phone since the early leaks. Overall not a big upgrade, all the same issues, and the GPU performance and drivers situation. Performance just trailing too behind other phones at it's price range. I know I know \"benchmarks aren't everything, optimization is king, you only need that power for gaming and blah blah\". Yeah until your phone has to brute force an unoptimized app (which is common on Android I fear) all Pixel owners I dare you open Best Buy or Amazon and immediately try to scroll, it WILL struggle. \n\nI decided to jump ship and got a One Plus 13, and let me tell you it was night and day. I got the 16 + 512 GB one for 800 (It was a sale + student discount). The performance jump was astronomical, this thing just flies through apps like it's nothing. Gaming of course is also no problem. The battery lasted 8+ hours on 5G (a miracle on pixel if you even get there). Thermal performance is excellent, no more hand warmer when just watching YouTube on wifi or just barely pushing it (Seriously how was that a thing). It truly felt like I had a flaship for real this time. \n\nIs it perfect? nah, Pixel UI is in general better, but not by much, if anything Oxygen OS let's you do things that were taken away, like status bar icons being able to be modified. Tho Pixel UI has one BIG FLAW, the status bar and gesture bar are disgustingly large and DON'T go transparent at all (Shit takes way too much screen real state like wtf). Oxygen OS lets you get rid of the gesture bar completely and it makes the phone feels much more immersive and its a godsend (been wanting this on pixel since the gesture bar was introduced). The camera is worse yes, but not too far behind either, I don't think too many pics so I was ok with this compromise. I don't care, and barely used, any of the AI features so it wasn't a big loss either.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the happiest I've been with a phone ever, don't be afraid to look outside of your pixel bubble if you feel like you're not getting what you paid for.

This was done under warranty repair at UBreakIFix. \n\nNow less than 6 months later, the replaced screen is still having issues that are not user-error. \n\nMy standard 1-year warranty expired last month. Because of this, UBreakIFix stated they will not honor a warranty on their 6-month-old replacement part. The most the Google support agent was able to do was tell me they \"submitted a request to the development team for a fix to roll out in a future update\" and give me a code for a 20% discount off of a new, previous-gen pixel 8 or 9 (lol).  \n\nI absolutely love the Pixel brand and have been purchasing Pixel and Google hardware since the Pixel 3, including Buds, Watches, Speakers, smart devices, and more.  \n\nI wanted to know if others have experienced this, or if someone could help me. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Two Saturdays nights ago, I was sitting at home playing Ghost of Yotei, and I saw the Android 16 upgrade was available, and so sure, download and install please.\n\nIt installed, and worked for a few hours.\n\nThen I left it unplugged overnight, and it presumably died from no battery.\n\nNext morning, I wake up, try to charge it, but it never turned on ever again (still hasn't, RIP).\n\nI took it to Ubreakifix (official repair partners here in NYC), they show me it's not pulling any power, so likely a motherboard issue.\n\nI then take it to the Google Store, they tell me the same thing. He says the repair would be like $500, so I should just get a new phone. They open a support ticket for me.\n\nFirst support tells me I'm out of luck because it's out of warranty, even given the upgrade killing the phone. Then I ask to escalate, and they ask for temporary access to my Google account and a proof of purchase. I consent and send them proof of purchase from Google Fi. Then they ask me for a diagnostic receipt from the Google Store visit, but I never got anything like that.\n\nSo I just give up and buy a Pixel 10 Pro because 2 weeks without of phone is getting in the way of work now, as peaceful as it was.\n\nSo yeah, careful out there, make sure you have backups and 2FA synced to the cloud or other devices before doing major upgrades.\n\nI've had the Pixel phones since the Nexus phones, so it's really disheartening that a major upgrade would do this and I would get 0 help and only runarounds from Google.",

    "selftext": "I had every single version of the pixel up until the pixel 6 pro, which I had lots of problems with regarding Bluetooth hearing aid functionality and support. Since I wearing aids it was pretty important that that worked for me, and it didn't.  I then moved to Samsung and have been with them ever since. \n\nRecently AT&T offered a \"get a pixel 10 pro XL for free with a trade-in of any pixel\" and I still had my pixel 6 pro so I decided to give it another try. Here's why I ended up sending it back...\n\n1.  I don't know if this is a move your data from Samsung to pixel problem but when I moved my data over to the pixel 10 pro none of my apps would send notifications. Google support was unhelpful and after a factory reset didn't resolve it they basically told me to turn it in for another phone, which I did. I got the second phone and has the same problem. I ended up figuring out that if I went into each app and deleted the cache and the data then the notifications would start working again. Since I have 250 plus apps that wasn't a very good solution. \n\n2.  I had heard that the pixel phones had a really bad scrolling experience, but I don't remember it when I had pixel phones. Coming from the Samsung it was blatantly obvious that scrolling on the pixel was awful. I did check some of the solutions to resolve this and none of them really made it much better.\n\n3.  The final straw was Bluetooth switching.  My Samsung phones prioritize the newest connection, which is super important to me. I go from my hearing aids to the car when I get into it, and when I leave the car it goes back to my hearing aids. When I  turn on my Bluetooth headphones the phone picks them and when I turn them off it goes back to my hearing aids. With the pixel none of that happened. When I got in the car I had had to actually select the car Bluetooth for the pixel to use it. When I turned on my Bluetooth headphones I had to actually select them for the pixel to use them. Needless to say that was a major irritation and that's when I decided the pixel was going back.",

My phone‚Äôs battery expanded, pushing up the screen ‚Äî a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore), but not other parts.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google‚Äôs authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they refused to replace just the battery and insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen, the LCD cost about SGD 200++‚Äî even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright scam or cost-shifting tactic ‚Äî forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a known manufacturing defect. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI‚Äôm without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day,\n\nI made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare) Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery. Still without a functioning phone after 6 days+ Service Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you?\n\nIf you‚Äôre facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it‚Äôll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I was wondering why the European Union, given that it has been fighting for years against the monopolies and golden cages imposed by tech giants, hasn't yet required operating system manufacturers to allow users to switch between integrated cloud/backup services, including the ability to transfer data from one service to another. This would increase competition in the market and reduce costs for end users, as well as allow for greater freedom. Currently, Android users are locked into Google One, Apple users into iCloud, and Windows users into OneDrive.",

I've been searching for an answer for a few hours and I keep landing on \"change the settings for the main camera app, if this doesn't work, uninstall and reinstall Camera App updates\". This has not worked and I can't figure out why it works in the camera app but not Google lens.    \nFor clarity, I am pressing the camera icon in the Google search bar at the bottom of the home screen as I use this multiple times a day. It's a minor gripe but I'm often using my phone one-handed and having to juggle my grip to press the shutter button on-screen is a kerfuffle.    \n    \nAm I being an idiot and missing a simple solution or do I need to download something third-party to circumvent this?    \n    \nI appreciate any feedback and I've now joined this sub because I've already found some useful tips I didn't know I needed!

    "selftext": "I bought a brand new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL from O2 in Slovakia, which is officially listed on Google‚Äôs website as an authorized reseller since Google does not have any official physical store here in Europe. \nThe phone was sealed and never used, purchased in June 2025.\n\nWhen I checked the warranty on Google‚Äôs support page, it showed the phone as purchased in January ‚Äî five months before I actually bought it.\nThe warranty was already shortened to less than 24 months, even though EU law guarantees a full 24-month warranty for new products.\n\nAfter some digging, it seems Google started the warranty countdown from the day the phone arrived in O2‚Äôs stock, not from the day it was sold to me. That‚Äôs clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.\n\nSo I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That‚Äôs when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn‚Äôt an authorized reseller, even though it‚Äôs literally listed on Google‚Äôs official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google‚Äôs warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone‚Äôs internal system logs to verify that it hadn‚Äôt been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that ‚Äî the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google‚Äôs own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers. Passing the blame is not just lazy ‚Äî it‚Äôs unacceptable.\n\nThis whole experience has been absurd.\n\nTL;DR:\nBought a new Google phone from O2 (authorized reseller).\nGoogle‚Äôs system says it was bought 5 months earlier ‚Üí shortened warranty.\nGoogle checked the phone logs remotely and confirmed it hadn‚Äôt been used before purchase ‚Üí still refused to fix the warranty.\nSupport keeps giving false info and closing the case.\n\nHas anyone else in the EU had a wrong purchase date or shortened warranty on a new Google phone? Did you ever get Google to fix it?",

So it is super common for a Google Home notification to pop up with 30 mins ago written on it. Same happens with other apps too. \n\nI have turned off the adaptive battery, have the Google Home and other apps allowed unrestricted access to battery, but nothing seems to work. I had a Pixel 8a and a Pixel 7 before this and never had the issue on them. \n\nNot sure if it is a faulty device or a software bug. ",

So, I don't know whether it's a bug report or there's a way to resolve this, but here goes:\n\nI have two ESIMs installed on my Pixel 8 Pro, one from my home country, and one from the country I immigrated to. The second ESIM is configured for all mobile uses - data, SMS, and phone calls - but the first one is just used for SMS messages for certain essential services in my home country.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes I receive calls to my first ESIM (from my home country), and my phone recognizes them as calls from the country to which I immigrated. Today, for example, a spam call came through from a number that I blocked in my home country because my phone thought the call came from the country I currently live in.\n\nDoes anyone know if there's a way to resolve this issue? I would really prefer to avoid paying the cellular provider from my home country anymore money for advanced spam filtering, especially since the calls are supposed to be already blocked by my device.",

It is specifically designed to connect to the Charging Speaker Dock and uses a unique pin configuration and internal circuitry known only to the tablet and the official dock.\nGeneric Specification: The cable you are considering is a generic 7.62mm 4-pin adapter designed for a wide range of small, low-power devices like smart watches, children's bracelets, and specific trackers (as mentioned in the reviews). The fact that the pins may look like they align does not mean the electrical connections (the pinout) will match the tablet's requirements.\nRisk of Damage: Attempting to charge a device with a non-compatible connector, even if it physically aligns, can potentially lead to no charge, slow charge, or in a worst-case scenario, damage to the device's internal charging circuitry.\nFor charging your Google Pixel Tablet, you should rely on the standard USB-C port or the official Google Charging Speaker Dock.\nthe end, your question was: Could this connector be used to charge my Google pixel 11-in tablet from the rear? The pins look like they will work and align",

I used to have bedtime mode set up that it would then on when I plugged my phone in at night (which is when I was going to sleep) and then it would start in bedtime mode until a) my alarm went off or b) I unplugged my phone. This meant on weekends my phone would stay silent until I woke up and unplugged it myself.\nSince I updated my phone this week, bedtime mode will now turn itself off after the alarm time as that is when it says my \"night time\" ends, even if my phone is still plugged in and has not been touched. This means as soon as I get a notification on a weekend morning, I wake up and my precious lie in is ruined.\nAny one else having the same issue and any idea how to fix this? Thanks!",

The Nest Thermostat had a discount applied since my existing Nest went obsolete\n\nOn August 21, 2025 I received a discount code for \"10% off a purchase.\" Rather than cancel my order which hadn't yet shipped, and replace the order with the discount code, I reached out to customer service to see if they could retroactively apply.\n\nCustomer service told me the following:\n\n11:49:06‚ÄØAM (me): Ok, so to be clear - once the entire order arrives (the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro), you want me to reach back out to the Google Support chat and share the coupon code, and then you'll apply the code to the order price after it's been delivered?\n11:50:15‚ÄØAM Robertson: Yes, exactly. that is correct. we are also informed by our support on that (my name), rather than cancelling the order and apply the code, its much more a hassle in our customers end as per our support team\n11:50:42‚ÄØAM Robertson: no worries once you contacted us back we can consult the case so the code will be applied\n11:52:02‚ÄØAM (me): Yeah it seems like a pain to cancel / re-order. And can you confirm that the 10% will be applied to both the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro? I did have some rebates / offers on these items that were applied (such as being a Google Fi customer), but wanted to make sure the 10% is still applicable on top of those discounts\n11:54:35‚ÄØAM Robertson: Oh yes, the 10% discount it will be applicable on top of those discounts (my name) no worries \n\n\nBecause of this, I didn't cancel and replace the order. \n\nHad I done so, I at least would have separated the order into two orders - and gotten the discount on the Nest for one order, and the discount on my phone (an extra $100 off) on the other.\n\nNow after TWO MONTHS of back and forth with customer service, I keep getting told that Google won't apply the discount like the original customer service agent guaranteed me they would. Google has effectively cheated me out of over $100.\n\nAll of their responses ignore the original interaction I had, including the most recent one:\n\nThank you for contacting the Google Support Team regarding your order. We sincerely apologize for the delay in our response and truly appreciate your patience during this review period.\n\nOur specialist team has thoroughly reviewed your request to apply an additional promotional code to your order. We regret to inform you that we cannot accommodate this request.\n\nWe understand this outcome is disappointing, and we want to sincerely apologize for any confusion or frustration this may have caused.\n\nOur higher support team confirmed that a prior promotion‚Äîthe Nest Learning Thermostat upgrade promotion‚Äîwas already utilized on the existing order where you wished to apply the new code. As per our terms of service, only one promotional code or discount can be applied per order. This policy prevents us from stacking multiple discounts onto a single purchase.\n\nWe recognize the frustration of not being able to use the additional discount, and we truly apologize for this policy constraint.\n\nIf you have any further questions, or if you need assistance exploring other ways to save on a future purchase, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nThanks!\nCed\nThe Google Support Team\n\n\nThere have been over 20 interactions back and forth, all of them ignore what the first agent told me. Anyone else go through this before?",

    "title": "Pixel 10 Photo Processing Experience Sharing",
    "selftext": "Well, I have been searching for this specific issue all over the internet to see if this is a common issue or not, but I couldn't find anything anywhere, so I guess I was the only lucky guy to experience this.\nA week ago, I was at a Barber üíà shop with my friend, and I really like to take photos anywhere I go, so we did take some really good pictures for each other using my Pixel 10. I then realized that all the photos I take are in the processing state for too long(never end for first photo), but I didn't think too much, and we keep on taking photos regardless of the last photos being in the processing state. Long story short, after our excellent barber done his job, I took some mirror selfie and would like to post it on my Facebook, but the photos are (still) processing. I then looked at the file names by chance and saw \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxxxx.jpg\" for these photos, oh yeah, may be my photos are so good that tensor G5 needs more time, I wonder. \nBut I really want to upload that mirror selfie on my Facebook, I couldn't wait more. So I did the most dumbest decision, I restarted my phone, just that the processing would start again and fix. But guess what and to my surprise, after restarting the phone, all of these previous \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxx.jpg\" were gone in thin air, I couldn't find it on photos, cloud, not on the trash. I really didn't believe that Google might have that kind of problem, so I waited, I tried taking another photos and these seem to become normal with their processing time being normal (1-3 sec) back again. But yet, the photos at the barber shop never came back. This is just my experience sharing about that and still no hate for Pixel (had been a fan since Nexus), but I think they might include some mitigation for this kind of situation, for example, at least saving the Non- processed photos on device or some kind of fail safe feature. \nBut yeah, this was the only time I've experienced this, and so far it's still working as expected. I hope this doesn't come again. Evidence? No, I really didn't think that kind of thing would ever happen, so no screenshot nor nothing was recorded.\n",

That‚Äôs clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.\n\nSo I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That‚Äôs when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn‚Äôt an authorized reseller, even though it‚Äôs literally listed on Google‚Äôs official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google‚Äôs warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone‚Äôs internal system logs to verify that it hadn‚Äôt been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that ‚Äî the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google‚Äôs own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers.

    "selftext": "Got the Pixel 10 Pro on launch, and since then it is impossible to get notifications on time. I have Google Home with camera notifications and cradlewise for baby notifications and all the notifications are delayed. Often I would unlock the phone and see a flurry of notifications from Google Home about camera activity popping up. Funny enough, these notifications are not time stamped to when the phone was unlocked, but when the event happened. So it is super common for a Google Home notification to pop up with 30 mins ago written on it. Same happens with other apps too. \n\nI have turned off the adaptive battery, have the Google Home and other apps allowed unrestricted access to battery, but nothing seems to work. I had a Pixel 8a and a Pixel 7 before this and never had the issue on them. \n\nNot sure if it is a faulty device or a software bug. ",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

(The phone works if i connect it to an external monitor)\n\nWhat i did not expect is they told me they would need to change pretty much everything and charge me around 380 USD (This includes a 50% discount provided by Samsung care+).\n\n  \nAfter receiving this SMS i have gone down to ask if they could just change the display but of course they didn't want to do that.\n\n  \nSince i already setup everything i needed on the cheapo Xiaomi and a backup iPhone i just told them that i will put that sum toward on my next phone.\n\n  \nSo, any suggestion on what to do with a S24Ultra?

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve never been a big fan of Samsung electronics. Didn‚Äôt have anything against them per se, but I just wasn‚Äôt often impressed by them. I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I‚Äôm there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "Ever since I updated my Watch7 to One UI 8, I‚Äôve had issues twice with the auto-pause feature during workouts (something that never happened before on the previous version).\n\nYesterday I went for a bike ride and stopped midway to chat with a friend. The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn‚Äôt record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I‚Äôll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn‚Äôt bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

I cannot get it to connect to my cmf phone 2 pro. What I tried:\n\n\\- clear cache and all data on galaxy wear (I've had a Samsung fit3 before)\n\n\\- completly reinstall the galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I have galaxy watch 7 plugin installed (as the wear app requested it)\n\n\\- I restarted both my phone and the watch\n\n\\- I tried multiple times, with and without logging into a samsung acount, accepting automatic updated and declining them.\n\n\\- I removed the watch from my bluetooth paired devices list\n\nHere's the steps that lead me to the issue:\n\n\\- I turn on my watch\n\n\\- I open galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I add new device\n\n\\- I press on Galaxy watch ultra under detected devices list\n\n\\- I press \"pair\" after confirming the code from the screen on the android pairing popup\n\n\\- It sometimes asks me if I want to log into samsung, I skip this step for now (same was happening when I logged in)\n\n\\- I agree to terms of service and other stuff\n\n\\- The app throws me back to my homescreen and when I want to come back to it, it shows scanning for available devices in galaxy wear app. \n\nI would really appreciate any help with that issue. The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time.

I even have some customisation in place with the \"Custom wear notification\" app.\n\nHowever one of the most important features that made me buy a watch is to receive notifications even when phone and watch are not connected to each other.\n\nRight now if the watch is not connected to the phone and I receive a notification for an app that's installed on the watch (e.g: Whatsapp) I still get the notification, both on the phone and on the watch with the Lte connection, however, that's not the case if the app is not available on wear os (e.g: Telegram, Incident.io, ...). And for those I only receive the notification on the phone.\n\nIs there anyway, I can still receive all apps notifications if they are not installed on the watch, and the watch and phone are not connected?\n\ne.g:\nTelegram -> send notification to phone -> phone send notification remotely to the watch",

Not just that, I reconnected it to my phone and it had tracked my sleep(along with hr and breathing) properly like it does everyday.\n\nThe thing is, in the battery section of settings it just shows what apps are using the battery which all combined isn't even 20%. \n\nSo, while being connected to the phone while your awake is non negotiable, ig it works if u want to just make it last a little longer in case u don't want to turn health features off \n\nEdit: what a weird coincidence, that someone asked a question on batter drain during night as I was writing this post, lol\n\nEdit2: corrected first line from hrs to days, sry",

I find the former more attractive but both seem to have similar activity and health metrics, which I'm more interested in.\n\nI'm swimming (pool and open water) and will start running; both not rigorously/competitive but for good health. I'm primarily looking forward to ecg and blood pressure as I'm lacking these in my current Huawei Fit3.\n\nMy question is: I'm currently using a Galaxy A55 5G. Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

    "selftext": "Bought my GW Ultra late last year when they were giving insane deals/trade-ins and was blown away by how good it was.  However, over the last few months, my HR has been becoming completely unusable as the numbers would jump around so much that I knew they weren't correct.  (I've been a distance runner for almost twenty years so I know my HR very well and I knew the watch was giving poor info.)  I've had a couple of forced resets of my watch and even starting over from scratch has not improved things.\n\nFor my birthday last week, I got a gift card to Amazon and I decided to finally purchase a HR monitor with a chest strap.  Found an unbelievable deal on one for only $20 and thought I'd try it.  Today, on its first run, I saw just how bad my Ultra was really performing.\n\nIn the pic below, the top picture is the still very new Ultra during a 2.5 mile run.  It climbs steadily until reaching my \"cruising\" HR, which will usually be between 145-155, depending on my exertion level that day.  The top pic is very acceptable to me.  I was doing a lot of HR zone training back then and with a good HR sensor, it was easily accomplished.\n\nThe bottom pic is today's run, a 1.55 mile treadmill run.  (Sorry, it was 38 degrees and raining, so not going outside!)  You can see a very similar HR pattern as the new Ultra had in the top pic.  A steady climb into the cruising zone and stayed there for the duration.  Never got above 150 the entire time.\n\nThe middle pic is yesterday's run, one mile on the treadmill using the Ultra only.  Wow, what a disaster.  All over the place and a couple of minute-long flatlines.  Also, notice the high of 171, which I know my heart never came near.  Definitely a cadence-lock issue, because my running cadence is always between 168 and 174.\n\nI'm one of those tactile-intolerant people and I thought for sure I'd hate running with this strap on my chest but I barely even noticed it the entire time.  The beauty is, once SportWerks has discovered the BLE device, it is stored and it will automatically find the device every time in the future so as long as I remember to put it on, it's as simple as that.\n\nNot sure why these things simply \"go bad\" but apparently, mine has.  Sharing this because I've seen enough posts from other runners/cyclists to know they are also having HR sensor issues.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn17yc8ijxwf1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a25d27193cc4e24239c1554d50b2a76870b84e\n\n",

    "selftext": "Ever since I updated my Watch7 to One UI 8, I‚Äôve had issues twice with the auto-pause feature during workouts (something that never happened before on the previous version).\n\nYesterday I went for a bike ride and stopped midway to chat with a friend. The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn‚Äôt record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I‚Äôll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn‚Äôt bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

I cannot get it to connect to my cmf phone 2 pro.

The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

So I turned of Bluetooth, then put airplane mode so lte dosent turn on nd then tucked in for the night.\n\nThis morning I wake up, lo nd behold the battery has gone down just 3%!

    "selftext": "Ever since I updated my Watch7 to One UI 8, I‚Äôve had issues twice with the auto-pause feature during workouts (something that never happened before on the previous version).\n\nYesterday I went for a bike ride and stopped midway to chat with a friend. The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn‚Äôt record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I‚Äôll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn‚Äôt bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

I cannot get it to connect to my cmf phone 2 pro.

The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**\n\n$1200ish USD.\n\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**\n\nEhhhhhhhh, possibly.\n\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**\n\nBattery Life, performance, build quality, and then form factor.\n\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**\n\nWeight is decently important; it will be lugged around in my backpack on campus.\n\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**\n\nAt least 15‚Äù, I keep two tabs open side-by-side often for schoolwork.\n\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**\n\nNo CAD, video or photo editing. I would hopefully like to use the laptop for playing Fortnite. However, performance and battery life for schoolwork is the most important. I will primarily be using Excel and eventually will be running SAS statistical software once I get farther in my program.\n\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**\n\nI‚Äôm a Fortnite girlie. I have no clue about FPS and all that honestly. I currently play on a slow asf PS4. I likely can‚Äôt afford a laptop that can run Fortnite well, that isn‚Äôt a $1600 laptop. ¬†\n\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**\n\nIt needs to have at least 16gb of ram with an SSD drive. A full/numeric backlit keyboard is a must as I use it all the time. It has to have at least one USB-A port as my wireless mouse uses it.\n\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**\n\nI'm a new graduate student in a Master of Public Health and Master of Business Administration program in the US. The laptop will primarily be used for school work. I currently have a 2016 HP Pavillion with a 15.6\" screen, 16gb ram, and a 2tb hard drive. It's got many problems with it, one of the worst being that I'm tethered to an outlet as it doesn't last more than 20ish minutes without dying. I did a bit of research before buying that laptop, but so much has changed in 9 years especially with these new AI üôÑ laptops. I was looking at Best Buy and they seemed uber expensive for not a lot behind it simply because it's a Copilot one or whatever.\n\n¬†\n\nMy usage: I have multiple tabs/programs open often. I already am using Excel in most of my MBA classes, and I will eventually be using SAS software in my public health classes. I utilize my laptop heavily for personal use as well. I need this laptop to be able to keep up in terms of processing speed. A good battery life is also highly important as I have 3-hour classes where there are literally 4 outlets in the classroom and I don't always get one of the outlets.",

I was considering the Samsung galaxy book 4 because I own a samsung phone and tablet but I wondered if I should just go for a standard laptop brand like Lenovo. \n\nI'm a student and would mostly be using it for presentations and writing. I'm looking for a good laptop which doesn't overheat or lag, has a good battery life and display, min 512 gb with upgradable storage or SD slot, lightweight but durable, lasts long and has adequate ports. \n\nThank you for your help!\n\n",

Everything went smooth until I left it off for 2 days, when I powered it on it just went straight into bios, windows wasnt even an option in the boot menu. My first thought was that I didn't install the SSD properly and it somehow unplugged itself. Just to make sure I went into the windows install again and found out that it detected the ssd, even said \"system drive\". I reinstalled windows once again just to find out that after 1-2 days being powered off, it does the same. Yesterday I was trying to solve it once again, and after 2 hours of me doing nothing just sitting in bios, I wanted to run the windows install, but it booted into windows from the ssd normally. Has anyone had this issue?",

    "selftext": "**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**\n\n$1200ish USD.\n\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**\n\nEhhhhhhhh, possibly.\n\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**\n\nBattery Life, performance, build quality, and then form factor.\n\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**\n\nWeight is decently important; it will be lugged around in my backpack on campus.\n\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**\n\nAt least 15‚Äù, I keep two tabs open side-by-side often for schoolwork.\n\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**\n\nNo CAD, video or photo editing. I would hopefully like to use the laptop for playing Fortnite. However, performance and battery life for schoolwork is the most important. I will primarily be using Excel and eventually will be running SAS statistical software once I get farther in my program.\n\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**\n\nI‚Äôm a Fortnite girlie. I have no clue about FPS and all that honestly. I currently play on a slow asf PS4. I likely can‚Äôt afford a laptop that can run Fortnite well, that isn‚Äôt a $1600 laptop. ¬†\n\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**\n\nIt needs to have at least 16gb of ram with an SSD drive. A full/numeric backlit keyboard is a must as I use it all the time. It has to have at least one USB-A port as my wireless mouse uses it.\n\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**\n\nI'm a new graduate student in a Master of Public Health and Master of Business Administration program in the US. The laptop will primarily be used for school work. I currently have a 2016 HP Pavillion with a 15.6\" screen, 16gb ram, and a 2tb hard drive. It's got many problems with it, one of the worst being that I'm tethered to an outlet as it doesn't last more than 20ish minutes without dying. I did a bit of research before buying that laptop, but so much has changed in 9 years especially with these new AI üôÑ laptops. I was looking at Best Buy and they seemed uber expensive for not a lot behind it simply because it's a Copilot one or whatever.\n\n¬†\n\nMy usage: I have multiple tabs/programs open often. I already am using Excel in most of my MBA classes, and I will eventually be using SAS software in my public health classes. I utilize my laptop heavily for personal use as well. I need this laptop to be able to keep up in terms of processing speed. A good battery life is also highly important as I have 3-hour classes where there are literally 4 outlets in the classroom and I don't always get one of the outlets.",

    "selftext": "**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**\n\n$1200ish USD.\n\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**\n\nEhhhhhhhh, possibly.\n\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**\n\nBattery Life, performance, build quality, and then form factor.\n\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**\n\nWeight is decently important; it will be lugged around in my backpack on campus.\n\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**\n\nAt least 15‚Äù, I keep two tabs open side-by-side often for schoolwork.\n\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**\n\nNo CAD, video or photo editing. I would hopefully like to use the laptop for playing Fortnite. However, performance and battery life for schoolwork is the most important. I will primarily be using Excel and eventually will be running SAS statistical software once I get farther in my program.\n\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**\n\nI‚Äôm a Fortnite girlie. I have no clue about FPS and all that honestly. I currently play on a slow asf PS4. I likely can‚Äôt afford a laptop that can run Fortnite well, that isn‚Äôt a $1600 laptop. ¬†\n\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**\n\nIt needs to have at least 16gb of ram with an SSD drive. A full/numeric backlit keyboard is a must as I use it all the time. It has to have at least one USB-A port as my wireless mouse uses it.\n\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**\n\nI'm a new graduate student in a Master of Public Health and Master of Business Administration program in the US. The laptop will primarily be used for school work. I currently have a 2016 HP Pavillion with a 15.6\" screen, 16gb ram, and a 2tb hard drive. It's got many problems with it, one of the worst being that I'm tethered to an outlet as it doesn't last more than 20ish minutes without dying. I did a bit of research before buying that laptop, but so much has changed in 9 years especially with these new AI üôÑ laptops. I was looking at Best Buy and they seemed uber expensive for not a lot behind it simply because it's a Copilot one or whatever.\n\n¬†\n\nMy usage: I have multiple tabs/programs open often. I already am using Excel in most of my MBA classes, and I will eventually be using SAS software in my public health classes. I utilize my laptop heavily for personal use as well. I need this laptop to be able to keep up in terms of processing speed. A good battery life is also highly important as I have 3-hour classes where there are literally 4 outlets in the classroom and I don't always get one of the outlets.",

    "selftext": "I got a prebuild system right around the height of covid when the GPU bubble was getting stupid and never really got around to upgrading it, and now its performance with games is starting to show its age a bit. I initially noticed it with Silent Hill 2 Remake, frame drops and some graphical artefacting. It's not unplayable, and I'm not even really keen on getting a strictly outstanding visual experience, but general performance drops are where I draw the line.\n\nMy usage for gaming isn't very labor intensive, I've beeen playing a lot of enshrouded and minecraft lately but I'd like to make a provision for heftier games that I dip into when they go on sale, like aforementioned silent hill, Cronos The New Dawn eventually. Dead Space Remake is probably the heaviest game I can run very well on high settings.  I'm thinking I need a new PSU in order to accomodate a new GPU since I've started to get a little coil whine since adding my NVME drive. I'm sitting at 500W right now with a Geforce 1660 and Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and 16GB DDR4 RAM. My motherboard is a bit old as well, so it might be worth moving on from that to avoid bottlenecking issues but I figure you'd know more about that than me.\n\nPCparts for my current build  \n[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qDRVjn](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qDRVjn)\n\nNewegg page for the prebuild itself, since i cant find the case on partspicker  \n[https://www.newegg.ca/skytech-archangel-gaming-desktop-geforce-gtx-1660-amd-ryzen-5-3600-16gb-ddr4-500gb-ssd-st-arch3-0-0054-ne/p/N82E16883289048](https://www.newegg.ca/skytech-archangel-gaming-desktop-geforce-gtx-1660-amd-ryzen-5-3600-16gb-ddr4-500gb-ssd-st-arch3-0-0054-ne/p/N82E16883289048)\n\nMy budget isn't a tremendous concern but my usage isn't that severe. I'm aiming for high settings at a consistent 60 frames at 1440p as a minimum for modern double-A games\n\nTLDR: Old AMD CPU, old GPU, possibly too little RAM, definitely too little wattage, and possibly too old mobo, please point me in the right direction to smoothly run AA games on high settings\n\nEDIT: I play a lot of Space Marine 2 on medium settings and it runs well enough, to give an idea on what games I'm usually playing",

No joy. Fans all spinning ok.\n\nSo... Im at a loss. Pulled the GPU out, switched the SDD connection to the second (read that), reconnected CPU power connectors, ATX power. No joy.\n\nSome questions:\n\n* any obvious blunder? I don't have any spare parts to swap in and out or another case to test anything in isolation unfortunately\n* whats the minimum component / PSU that I need connected to the motherboard so I can see a bios setup on a monitor? SSD? GPU? CPU even?\n* I finally gave up trying to update the bios (maybe it worked?) to get past the white led fail and so took the CPU, complete with heatsink / fan, out. Surprisingly after unscrewing the fan/heatsink screws it just came up with the CPU as well, even tho the motherboard lever was down. That doesnt seem right but I definitely did put the CPU in with the lever up and then put it down. The bottom of the CPU looks fine, no bent pins, well sealed with the heatsink. looks as expected. Maybe I botched something here.\n\nI think to reinstall I need to unstick the heatsink to put the CPU in on its own again?\n\nAny tips, thoughts gratefully received.\n\n",

Also a new workflow I need to follow uses tons of smart layers, which are quite annoyingly lagging. Storage is also super important and I'm at my 1 M2 slot limit already, lol. I also usually have tons of stuff open at the same time.\n\nI also play CS2, BF6 and several other games, while often also streaming to Discord. It feels at the moment that streaming at anything over 720p60 drops my FPS a ton and brings tons of stuttering.\n\nI'm considering getting the 9950x3D, a Corsair Nautilus 360 AIO, Corsair 2x48gb 6000 CL30 Ram, and an Asus X870-Plus. Although I'm Brazilian and stuff is quite more expensive here (this all would be around 2250USD, converted from BRL), financially it is not a big deal for me, especially as it will improve my work output.\n\nDoes this upgrade makes sense for this scenario?

Always used to play on my xbox / playstation and still game like 8-10hrs a week on my ps5.\n\nRecently bought an nice big house with too many rooms so im gonna transform one in an gaming room, and want to start gaming on pc instead of my ps5. Like i said i have 0 experience with computer, let alone building one haha. But that it is completely new i really enjoy and makes me curious! Been watching some video's about and can't wait to start building one during the winter months. Sounds like an awesome project to me.\n\nThe current idea to build is this:\nGpu: 9070xt (669eu) or 5070ti (900eu)\nCpu: amd ryzen 7 7800x3d (379eu)\nMotherboard: msi mag b650\nRam: kingston ddr5 rgb 2x16gb(170eu)\nSsd: samsung 2tb 990 evo plus(140eu)\nCooling: deepcool le360 water (67eu)\nPower: cooler master 850 (105eu)\nCase : around 80eu.\n\nThis totals: around 1700eu with the 9070xt or 1930 with 5070ti.\n\nThe games i mosty play are rocketleague but wanna try csgo, minecraft & some other shooters. I know this set up will be probally be overkill for it, but hey i wanna future proof myself and have enough money.\n\nGonna use my 144hz msi curved 27inch monitor as second and probally an new 180hz oled monitor or normal 180hz monitor as main.\n\nAny tips, recommendantios or thing u would change? \n\nEnglish isn't my native language so sorry for any weird sentences or bad grammar.

My current monitor is a 1080p 60Hz.\n\nI mostly play games like War Thunder, Minecraft (with mods and/or shaders), and CS2. I have no issues with CS2 in terms of graphics or fps. On War Thunder, my fps sits at about 70-80fps on medium graphics with 4x SSAA. Minecraft depends on the mods and shaders, but I sit at around 60-80fps with Solas and Complementary Shaders, \\~80 lighter mods, and 12 chunks of render distance. \n\nI intend on getting either a 1440p 144Hz monitor or a GPU November or December, and the other in February. As I understand, a 9060xt or 5060-Ti will most likely be bottlenecked by my CPU at 1080p and less at 1440p. \n\nWhich should I get first, the monitor or GPU? I'm also open to other suggestions, either for alternative monitors/GPUs or upgrade priorities. ",

I noticed when I right click on desktop it was showing an AMD Radeon control option instead of the Nvidia Control Panel.  So I used DDU and uninstalled all the AMD drivers in safe mode.  This removed the AMD Radeon control option when I right click on desktop; however, the Nvidia Control Panel still doesn't show up.  I uninstalled/reinstalled full Nvidia drivers and also tried Nvidia control panel separately and it still doesn't show up.  Any idea on why this may be? \n\nAlso, under Device Manager I can still see AMD Radeon Graphics as well as my Nvidia 5070Ti.  I am assuming this is due to 9800X3D having integrated graphics, because even after using DDU to uninstall AMD-related drivers/software it came back.  Do I need to worry about anything interfering with Nvidia here?",

    "selftext": "\\*\\*Current System Specs:\\*\\*  \nRyzen 7 7800x3d  \nMSI pro b650-p wifi (latest bios)  \nAsus TUF RTX 5090  \nCorsair Vengeance 2x48 GB DDR5 RAM at slots 2 and 4 (have tried 4800/5200/5600/6000 MHz)  \nI previously had G Skill Flare 2x16 GB DDR5 RAM at slots 2 and 4 (tried at both 4800 and 6000 MHz)\n\nI swap between a 1080p 500 Hz monitor and a 4k 240 Hz monitor. Stutters happens on both. I removed extra displays to remove an extra factor for micro-stuttering -- didn't help.\n\nI don't know if I just never noticed these issues in the past, but it's been driving me crazy since I started using AMD Ryzen CPUs.\n\nIt started with the Ryzen 7 5800x, which had CPU stutters that drove me mad. After endless troubleshooting, reformatting the PC, upgrading to literally the fastest B-die RAM at the time; it still would not stop stuttering.\n\nI upgraded to a 7800X3D since. It STILL stutters, especially if any process is running at all.\n\nI upgraded to an RTX 5090. I didn't think the stutters were GPU-related in the first place, but yeah, the RTX 5090 doesn't help at all.\n\nI've tried enabling and disabling Expo on my RAM. I've tried manually clocking it lower. MemTests show no issues.\n\nI've tried hundreds of different permutation in my BIOS settings at this point. C-State on/off, SMT on/off, different memory settings, efficiency mode on/off...\n\nI've tried different power plans within Windows. I've tried the Ryzen Balanced Power Plan from AMD. I've tried setting CPU minimum state to 100%, 50%, 20%, 10%, 0%.\n\nI've removed EVERY unnecessary USB device, such that the only USB devices still connected to my PC are a Sennheiser GSX 1200 audio amp/external sound card, a Logitech mouse lightspeed receiver, and a Wooting keyboard.\n\nMy mouse is set to 1000 polling rate. I'm aware of the issues with higher polling rates.\n\nI have ZERO overlays running. All disabled.\n\nI've tried playing around with CPU affinities, priorities.\n\nEven when not gaming, really, I notice the stutters. I can just be moving my mouse across my screen and it'll have a microstutter.\n\nThe only thing I can do is mitigate the stutters. I treat my PC like it's intended for a single use only. Everything else is closed out while I game, code, or whatever. But even then, it STILL stutters -- only less.\n\nHow do I get rid of these nightmare stutters?\n\nIs this primarily an AMD thing? Is Intel doing better in this regard? I will gladly take up to a 30% fps hit if it means my PC stops fucking stuttering.",

I've come across the Gigabyte B850M DS3H (rev. 1.0) and so far it seems alright.\n\nMy question to you, kind people, is do you have any particular motherboard in mind that would be a good fit for my build or is the Gigabyte I'm looking at a decent choice? Is the B650 a safer option?\n\nAlso, what's the difference between the *EAGLE MAX* and *GAMING* version of the RTX 5060 besides the clock speed? Reference card is the same and the difference is less than 50 MHz. An Eagle Max model is about 10 ‚Ç¨ cheaper than a Gaming model.\n\nThis is my first PC build so keep it in mind, don't roast me too much haha.\n\nThank you very much for helping!",

For the new build I was thinking of making the jump to 1440p, while I play some casual esports games, along with turn based (like Civilization, Football Manager) and I do simracing. Also even though I have a PS5 for majority of AAA titles I would also like to be able to play a lot of them (60+fps@1440p High+) for scenarios like through deals that are far more worth it on pc or for games that dont get released on console at the same time.

With that in mind I had this build thought out:\n\nBudget: Around 1500 euros (With prices right now in Greece the current one is around there although I would not mind cheaper options)\n\nCPU: Ryzen 7 9700x (This > 9600x because of the bit of productivity I want although I am tore about if I really need it and also if the 7700x is better for 40euros cheaper but I am concerned about the tdp diff)\n\nMobo: Asus TUF B650-e \n\nRam: 32GB DDR5 (I would like the optimal speeds and cl in terms of price to perfomrance tho)\n\nGPU: 5070/9070/9070xt (Also tore between the three in terms of price and perfomance for my needs)\n\nCPU Cooler: Nautilus RS 360 AIO\n\nPSU: 850W B+ or A on the tier list (Lian Li edge or Corsair RMe depending on prices and availability both around 100 unless 850 is overkill and 750 better)\n\nSSD; Crucial p310\n\nCase: Lian-Li O11 Vision Compact\n\nFans: 5x Arcitic 120 PRO fans\n\nI am open to even completely different suggestions for anything but I would like to keep around that budget or even lower if value to perf is worth it and I would also like to keep a nice aesthetic (I was thinking a plain black or white build with minimal RGB if at all) and a bit more nicer looking that my current one that sits inside of a NZXT h500.

    "selftext": "just now getting back into pc building after years cause it seems like my old pc is on it's last legs (literally still on am3 it's been that long). i've settled on my new build having a 9800x3d as it seems most of the games i play are cpu intensive and i would like to have these games running high fps while looking nice bc that's something i haven't experienced in years üôÉ(games i'd be playing are tarkov, cs2, rust, and deadlock mainly). the main gpu i've been looking at is the 9060 xt 16 gb just simply because of well it performs for it's price but from what i've seen online, the 9060 xt is considered a weak card to pair with a 9800x3d. normally i would just bite the bullet and spend the extra money for a 9070 or a 9070 xt but the difference in price between the 9060 xt and those is just so asinine, i just don't want to pay nearly twice the amount of money for a gpu that would give me negligible to little performance increase in the games i play.\n\nedit: somehow i forgot to mention that i'll be mostly 1440p gaming\n\nedit again: seems like the move is getting a better gpu with a 7800x3d instead, thank you all for the insight!",

A friend of mine that has built a pc before lent me his windows 10 bootable usb. However, my pc refuses to boot from the USB. I have checked to make sure that the usb is first in the boot sequence from my bios menu, and I‚Äôve selected it on the boot menu, both of these methods have failed. Is it possible that the bootable USB just isn‚Äôt functional anymore and I need to create a new one?\n\n2. When I tested my build out of the case, it got a display and I could get to bios just fine. Once it was in the case‚Ä¶no display. I troubleshooted for hours and finally got it to work by plugging straight into the display on my MB, and disabling integrated graphics, which allowed it to then use my GPU as the default display. However, now I‚Äôve been having issues again. A few hours ago I could not get the display to work, and the only solution was to switch from a DP cable to an HDMI cable, and it worked. Now I‚Äôm sitting at my PC again and‚Ä¶no display‚Ä¶until I switched back to the DP cable. Are both cables crappy and need to be replaced? Is there a setting that is causing this?\n\nAny and all help is appreciated. I have a few friends who are keen with PC‚Äôs, and they are also at a loss",

The 9060 XT 16GB goes for 370-400‚Ç¨ in France and seems the best value.\n\nIn the list above, do you think there is a better choice? Is it really better to buy a more expensive GPU like the 7800 XT or even the 9070XT?\n\nIs there a GPU I didn‚Äôt think of that could be a better choice?\n\nNext I‚Äôll see if I need to change my CPU, but the GPU seems to always be the limiting component for my resolution.\n\nThanks :)",

But mine has a red wire that comes off and wraps around the back side to another connector (see images?) spinning by hand the cpu makes noise and running vs off it's a super noticable diff (turn volume up to max to really hear it since my phone mic is junk and picked it up poorly). Please help me figure out if there's either a way to fix or quit this existing fan or if it's toast.

    "selftext": "Hey, so I recently bought a few better quality fans for my case, and figured instead of getting rid of the old ones, I would just set them to a lower speed so they're not as loud. When researching the setup for my new ones (top and rear), I found that [noctua is actually recommending setting the top as exhaust and intake instead of just 2 exhausts. ](https://www.noctua.at/en/expertise/blog/best-fan-setup-fractal-design-north)\n\nSo I set it up this way (3 front intake, 2 top intake + exhaust and 1 rear exhaust) and I have found that during gaming benchmarks my CPU does indeed run 4 degrees cooler this way, but my CPU has never been a problem because I have a peerless assassin on it that just keeps it icy anyway lol. The thing is that my GPU in my 1 rear + 1 top at exhaust configuration was running colder than it does with 1 rear + 2 top (in+out) config: at hotspot, it was up to 80¬∞C, and now it's fluctuating between 79¬∞C and 83¬∞C, which is worse than it was without any top fans at all. So I guess, barring the obvious \"if GPU is a problem, use the setup that makes it better for GPU\", are there any other considerations regarding all this? I am still very much confused about the idea of blowing air from the top and then blowing it back through the top again. Thanks. ",

However, there are some things missing: case, power source and some extra windfans.\n\nFor the case i am considering the Thermaltake The Tower 600, the yellow version. However, that case i have to buy here, just to avoid shipping problems and such. The price here is about ‚Ç¨100 more compared to a rather standard model (the rectangular, black fish tanks models).   \n  \nAlso, I will add some more fans (indifferent of which case, i need good ventilation) however, if i will buy the Tower 600, I also want the yellow Thermaltake fans, which are about ‚Ç¨50 more expensive than a regular RGB fan., and i will need 2, so totaling ‚Ç¨100 more. One option is to buy first a cheaper set, until i have saved some money to buy the yellow ones, and switch them. However doing this will mean i have spent the price of the cheap one PLUS the expensive ones.  \n  \nFinally the power source. I do know that i will need a gold full modular 800-850W, but yet again, does it justify by, for example the thermaltake power source, or a cheaper brand with the specs that are similar. And here again, the difference between the first one or a cheaper one is about ‚Ç¨75-100.\n\n  \nWhere does it stop, the adding a bit more of this, a bit more of that? Is it really justified to spend that much money more just to aesthetics? I mean, on just the components, I almost will spend as much as i did for the internal components. I understand that some things you really shouldn't be stingy on, like the power source, but my autism doesn't really let me focus rationally.

As far as I read it is already quite efficient at very low load (which could matter a lot) and in general it is not a bad PSU. Regarding CPU I am not sure if I should go down the AMD (8600G for example) or the Intel (something like Intel Core Ultra 5 225) and where I am really hesitant is the motherboard and RAM question. What would you recommend if as low as possible idle consumption is a definite goal here?\n\n  \nThank you for your help.",

    "selftext": "Since the release of the RTX 5080, there‚Äôs been a lots of issues - from ridiculous pricing to overheating and melting reports. I decided to wait for the 5080 Ti, hoping Nvidia would fix those problems, but I‚Äôve come to realize it‚Äôs probably never coming. And even if it does, it‚Äôll be overpriced as hell.\n\nSo I started looking for alternatives.  \nRight now, I see three realistic options:\n\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** \\- around ‚Ç¨950 in my country. Slightly lower performance, but much better value.\n* **RX 9070 XT** \\-  about ‚Ç¨750, even stronger price/performance ratio. The thing is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been burned by AMD drivers before. My old 6800 XT literally died because of them, and DLSS still beats even the newest FSR in both quality and adoption.\n* **RTX 5080** \\- averages ‚Ç¨1340. I'm just afraid of this card. I've heard only bad things about it. And it's cost almost twice as best AMD GPU.\n\nFor reference, here‚Äôs my current setup:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (Wi-Fi)\n* **RAM:** 32 GB DDR4 @ 4,396 MHz\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n* **Main monitor:** 1440p HDR\n* **Secondary:** 1440p (YouTube / multitasking)\n* **PSU:** be quiet! Pure Power 12 M 1200 W (yeah, I know, overkill)\n\nMy 3080 Ti is starting to choke on newer titles, and the lack of access to modern upscaling tech is becoming noticeable.  \nIt sucks that so much of GPU performance now relies on software tricks, but here we are.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ what would you do in my place?",

    "selftext": "Okay okay guys, i gotta say im very very new to computers in general. I'm 28 now and the last time i had an computer at home i was like 13, not that we we're poor, just didnt use it. Always used to play on my xbox / playstation and still game like 8-10hrs a week on my ps5.\n\nRecently bought an nice big house with too many rooms so im gonna transform one in an gaming room, and want to start gaming on pc instead of my ps5. Like i said i have 0 experience with computer, let alone building one haha. But that it is completely new i really enjoy and makes me curious! Been watching some video's about and can't wait to start building one during the winter months. Sounds like an awesome project to me.\n\nThe current idea to build is this:\nGpu: 9070xt (669eu) or 5070ti (900eu)\nCpu: amd ryzen 7 7800x3d (379eu)\nMotherboard: msi mag b650\nRam: kingston ddr5 rgb 2x16gb(170eu)\nSsd: samsung 2tb 990 evo plus(140eu)\nCooling: deepcool le360 water (67eu)\nPower: cooler master 850 (105eu)\nCase : around 80eu.\n\nThis totals: around 1700eu with the 9070xt or 1930 with 5070ti.\n\nThe games i mosty play are rocketleague but wanna try csgo, minecraft & some other shooters. I know this set up will be probally be overkill for it, but hey i wanna future proof myself and have enough money.\n\nGonna use my 144hz msi curved 27inch monitor as second and probally an new 180hz oled monitor or normal 180hz monitor as main.\n\nAny tips, recommendantios or thing u would change? \n\nEnglish isn't my native language so sorry for any weird sentences or bad grammar.

Repeated BSOD even after moving RAM around and with multiple DIMMs. Looking to replace CPU and motherboard to eliminate the instability for minimal cost. \n\nI‚Äôm actually quite happy with the i7s performance. It‚Äôs paired with a GTX1060. Despite the age of this build, it‚Äôs still serving me well for the games I play. I‚Äôm not one for new AAA games, the newest being ARC Raiders and Cyberpunk before that. Both ran at acceptable frame rates. Obviously, I‚Äôm looking for something more powerful, preferably with better power efficiency, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be the best of the best. \n\nSo, do I look for a deal on a used Ryzen 7 5800X3D, or would I be better jumping right to AM5? \n\nI‚Äôd rather buy new than used to maximise the lifespan of the parts, so buying a used 5800X3D isn‚Äôt ideal, but the cost of AM5 parts is also off putting. I ought to get decent performance gains with either option. \n\nI‚Äôm looking for a CPU that will perform at least as well as my i7, but other than that, cost is my most important factor. I am hoping to get a new CPU and motherboard for less than around ¬£600, although the lower the better. I‚Äôm not looking to upgrade my GPU right now, but probably will next year (looking at the 9060 XT).\n\nI‚Äôd appreciate any suggestions for my upgrade path here, especially opinions about AM4/5.

I initially noticed it with Silent Hill 2 Remake, frame drops and some graphical artefacting. It's not unplayable, and I'm not even really keen on getting a strictly outstanding visual experience, but general performance drops are where I draw the line.\n\nMy usage for gaming isn't very labor intensive, I've beeen playing a lot of enshrouded and minecraft lately but I'd like to make a provision for heftier games that I dip into when they go on sale, like aforementioned silent hill, Cronos The New Dawn eventually. Dead Space Remake is probably the heaviest game I can run very well on high settings.  I'm thinking I need a new PSU in order to accomodate a new GPU since I've started to get a little coil whine since adding my NVME drive. I'm sitting at 500W right now with a Geforce 1660 and Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and 16GB DDR4 RAM. My motherboard is a bit old as well, so it might be worth moving on from that to avoid bottlenecking issues but I figure you'd know more about that than me.\n\nPCparts for my current build  \n[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qDRVjn](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qDRVjn)\n\nNewegg page for the prebuild itself, since i cant find the case on partspicker  \n[https://www.newegg.ca/skytech-archangel-gaming-desktop-geforce-gtx-1660-amd-ryzen-5-3600-16gb-ddr4-500gb-ssd-st-arch3-0-0054-ne/p/N82E16883289048](https://www.newegg.ca/skytech-archangel-gaming-desktop-geforce-gtx-1660-amd-ryzen-5-3600-16gb-ddr4-500gb-ssd-st-arch3-0-0054-ne/p/N82E16883289048)\n\nMy budget isn't a tremendous concern but my usage isn't that severe.

Surprisingly after unscrewing the fan/heatsink screws it just came up with the CPU as well, even tho the motherboard lever was down. That doesnt seem right but I definitely did put the CPU in with the lever up and then put it down. The bottom of the CPU looks fine, no bent pins, well sealed with the heatsink. looks as expected. Maybe I botched something here.\n\nI think to reinstall I need to unstick the heatsink to put the CPU in on its own again?\n\nAny tips, thoughts gratefully received.\n\n",

Also a new workflow I need to follow uses tons of smart layers, which are quite annoyingly lagging. Storage is also super important and I'm at my 1 M2 slot limit already, lol. I also usually have tons of stuff open at the same time.\n\nI also play CS2, BF6 and several other games, while often also streaming to Discord. It feels at the moment that streaming at anything over 720p60 drops my FPS a ton and brings tons of stuttering.\n\nI'm considering getting the 9950x3D, a Corsair Nautilus 360 AIO, Corsair 2x48gb 6000 CL30 Ram, and an Asus X870-Plus. Although I'm Brazilian and stuff is quite more expensive here (this all would be around 2250USD, converted from BRL), financially it is not a big deal for me, especially as it will improve my work output.\n\nDoes this upgrade makes sense for this scenario?

My current monitor is a 1080p 60Hz.\n\nI mostly play games like War Thunder, Minecraft (with mods and/or shaders), and CS2. I have no issues with CS2 in terms of graphics or fps. On War Thunder, my fps sits at about 70-80fps on medium graphics with 4x SSAA. Minecraft depends on the mods and shaders, but I sit at around 60-80fps with Solas and Complementary Shaders, \\~80 lighter mods, and 12 chunks of render distance. \n\nI intend on getting either a 1440p 144Hz monitor or a GPU November or December, and the other in February. As I understand, a 9060xt or 5060-Ti will most likely be bottlenecked by my CPU at 1080p and less at 1440p. \n\nWhich should I get first, the monitor or GPU?

Pure Power 12 M 1200 W (yeah, I know, overkill)\n\nMy 3080 Ti is starting to choke on newer titles, and the lack of access to modern upscaling tech is becoming noticeable.  \nIt sucks that so much of GPU performance now relies on software tricks, but here we are.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ what would you do in my place?",

Always used to play on my xbox / playstation and still game like 8-10hrs a week on my ps5.\n\nRecently bought an nice big house with too many rooms so im gonna transform one in an gaming room, and want to start gaming on pc instead of my ps5. Like i said i have 0 experience with computer, let alone building one haha. But that it is completely new i really enjoy and makes me curious! Been watching some video's about and can't wait to start building one during the winter months. Sounds like an awesome project to me.\n\nThe current idea to build is this:\nGpu: 9070xt (669eu) or 5070ti (900eu)\nCpu: amd ryzen 7 7800x3d (379eu)\nMotherboard: msi mag b650\nRam: kingston ddr5 rgb 2x16gb(170eu)\nSsd: samsung 2tb 990 evo plus(140eu)\nCooling: deepcool le360 water (67eu)\nPower: cooler master 850 (105eu)\nCase : around 80eu.\n\nThis totals: around 1700eu with the 9070xt or 1930 with 5070ti.\n\nThe games i mosty play are rocketleague but wanna try csgo, minecraft & some other shooters. I know this set up will be probally be overkill for it, but hey i wanna future proof myself and have enough money.\n\nGonna use my 144hz msi curved 27inch monitor as second and probally an new 180hz oled monitor or normal 180hz monitor as main.\n\nAny tips, recommendantios or thing u would change? \n\nEnglish isn't my native language so sorry for any weird sentences or bad grammar.

Repeated BSOD even after moving RAM around and with multiple DIMMs. Looking to replace CPU and motherboard to eliminate the instability for minimal cost. \n\nI‚Äôm actually quite happy with the i7s performance. It‚Äôs paired with a GTX1060. Despite the age of this build, it‚Äôs still serving me well for the games I play. I‚Äôm not one for new AAA games, the newest being ARC Raiders and Cyberpunk before that. Both ran at acceptable frame rates. Obviously, I‚Äôm looking for something more powerful, preferably with better power efficiency, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be the best of the best. \n\nSo, do I look for a deal on a used Ryzen 7 5800X3D, or would I be better jumping right to AM5? \n\nI‚Äôd rather buy new than used to maximise the lifespan of the parts, so buying a used 5800X3D isn‚Äôt ideal, but the cost of AM5 parts is also off putting. I ought to get decent performance gains with either option. \n\nI‚Äôm looking for a CPU that will perform at least as well as my i7, but other than that, cost is my most important factor. I am hoping to get a new CPU and motherboard for less than around ¬£600, although the lower the better. I‚Äôm not looking to upgrade my GPU right now, but probably will next year (looking at the 9060 XT).\n\nI‚Äôd appreciate any suggestions for my upgrade path here, especially opinions about AM4/5.

I'm aiming for high settings at a consistent 60 frames at 1440p as a minimum for modern double-A games\n\nTLDR: Old AMD CPU, old GPU, possibly too little RAM, definitely too little wattage, and possibly too old mobo, please point me in the right direction to smoothly run AA games on high settings\n\nEDIT: I play a lot of Space Marine 2 on medium settings and it runs well enough, to give an idea on what games I'm usually playing",

I built this system back in early 2020. It still works pretty well overall, but the GPU started acting up about a year ago, and I‚Äôve had to make some performance compromises in newer games.  \nFor Christmas, I‚Äôd like to upgrade my build while keeping the same motherboard. so I‚Äôd be changing the CPU and GPU. As far as I know, I‚Äôm limited to **AM4 chipsets** for the CPU, but I‚Äôm not sure whether to go with NVIDIA or AMD for the GPU.\n\nMy goal is to make an upgrade that lets me play modern titles more smoothly and ideally lasts another 3‚Äì5 years. Of course, I‚Äôd like to avoid any major CPU/GPU bottlenecks.\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  \nIf your advice is to upgrade to an AM5 motherboard as well, please explain what benefits I‚Äôd get from that choice.\n\nThanks, everyone!\n\nEDIT: Right now, I was thinking about going with a **Ryzen 9 5950X** and either an **RTX 5070** or an **RX 9070XT**.",

    "selftext": "Ok, its been 15+ years since I last built a PC and wanted to do it again with my son for his birthday. But I cant get it to post anything to the monitor and Im seeing the white CPU debug light on the motherboard.\n\nParts:\n\n* Motherboard: B550MPRO-VDHWIFI\n* CPU: ryzen 5 5600XT AM4\n* GPU: MSI 5700RTX\n* PSU: Thermaltake toughpower GX2 600W Plus gold\n* SSD: Samsung 990 Evo plus 1Tb\n* RAM: GSkill ripjaws 2x8Gb DD43200\n* Case: NZXT H3 Flow Micro-ATX\n\nI read / watched a lot about the motherboard bios upgrade being the fix and which Ive tried with 2 different USB drives, both flash for several minutes and eventually finish (5+ mins). No joy. Fans all spinning ok.\n\nSo... Im at a loss. Pulled the GPU out, switched the SDD connection to the second (read that), reconnected CPU power connectors, ATX power. No joy.\n\nSome questions:\n\n* any obvious blunder? I don't have any spare parts to swap in and out or another case to test anything in isolation unfortunately\n* whats the minimum component / PSU that I need connected to the motherboard so I can see a bios setup on a monitor? SSD? GPU? CPU even?\n* I finally gave up trying to update the bios (maybe it worked?) to get past the white led fail and so took the CPU, complete with heatsink / fan, out. Surprisingly after unscrewing the fan/heatsink screws it just came up with the CPU as well, even tho the motherboard lever was down. That doesnt seem right but I definitely did put the CPU in with the lever up and then put it down. The bottom of the CPU looks fine, no bent pins, well sealed with the heatsink. looks as expected. Maybe I botched something here.\n\nI think to reinstall I need to unstick the heatsink to put the CPU in on its own again?\n\nAny tips, thoughts gratefully received.\n\n",

Also a new workflow I need to follow uses tons of smart layers, which are quite annoyingly lagging. Storage is also super important and I'm at my 1 M2 slot limit already, lol. I also usually have tons of stuff open at the same time.\n\nI also play CS2, BF6 and several other games, while often also streaming to Discord. It feels at the moment that streaming at anything over 720p60 drops my FPS a ton and brings tons of stuttering.\n\nI'm considering getting the 9950x3D, a Corsair Nautilus 360 AIO, Corsair 2x48gb 6000 CL30 Ram, and an Asus X870-Plus. Although I'm Brazilian and stuff is quite more expensive here (this all would be around 2250USD, converted from BRL), financially it is not a big deal for me, especially as it will improve my work output.\n\nDoes this upgrade makes sense for this scenario?

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today¬†announced a new partnership¬†with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by¬†Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also¬†just broke¬†that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners‚Äîa group of investors‚Äîwould be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game‚Äôs many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroƒülu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2¬†is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If¬†The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the sameÔªø experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original‚Äôs formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player‚Äôs ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however‚Äîparticularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn‚Äôt a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste ‚Äì it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio‚Äôs vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I‚Äôll admit, there‚Äôs a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [S√∂nke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw ‚Äì it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine ‚Äî sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices ‚Äî all wrapped in Obsidian‚Äôs signature corporate satire. It‚Äôs funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it‚Äôs a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galv√£o](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved‚Äîbitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting‚Äîbut without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Micha≈Ç Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom‚Äîthough a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian‚Äôs brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland‚Äîalmost forgettable‚Äîcompanions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It‚Äôs a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn‚Äôt lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you‚Äôll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran ≈Ωalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features. The Outer Worlds 2 showcases impressive narrative adaptability to player choices, lacking only a bit of technical ambition and polish to rank among the best role-playing games of today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - [Kyuman Kim](https://opencritic.com/critic/9273/kyuman-kim) - *Korean* - [8.2 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=310629)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 showcases Obsidian's RPG mastery through meaningful choices and dynamic character building, though the world lacks the vibrancy of modern open-world games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Just Play it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it)** - [Aimen TAIB](https://opencritic.com/critic/10987/aimen-taib) - *Arabic* - [7.5 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not be suitable for all players due to its complex narrative, but it‚Äôs undoubtedly a fitting choice for those seeking a deep RPG experience that demands thought and analysis. It offers you the freedom to choose a path that aligns with your own direction, both in terms of story and gameplay. However, it still suffers from several issues that need fixing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [9 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deceptively smart Looter-shooter RPG with colourful worlds and entertaining characters, and some really satisfying, malleable combat.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MondoXbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)** - [Giuseppe Genga](https://opencritic.com/critic/7638/giuseppe-genga) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3825/the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 improves upon its predecessor in mission design, combat, and meaningful player choice, offering a solid sci-fi RPG experience. However, it unfortunately falters in its narrative, with a lackluster story and unconvincing companions that fail to engage, leaving a technically proficient but less inspired adventure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MonsterVine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine)** - [Joe Bariso](https://opencritic.com/critic/7475/joe-bariso) - [3.5 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a serviceable RPG held back from greatness by playing it too safe and small. Too afraid to alienate players and make big swings like the setting deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Andrew Logue](https://opencritic.com/critic/3996/andrew-logue) - [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves if it ain‚Äôt broke, make it bigger and prettier - a solid sequel that expands upon the first game in meaningful ways, though some fans might experience a bit of d√©j√† vu.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Vincent Ternida](https://opencritic.com/critic/8412/vincent-ternida) - [8 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a title well worth exploring, offering accessible gameplay and thoughtful quality-of-life enhancements that cater to both newcomers and returning fans. While it doesn‚Äôt radically reinvent the formula, it delivers a satisfying action RPG experience that scratches the adventure itch and rewards players who engage with its missions in full.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Patryk Dziƒôglewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/8235/patryk-dzi-glewicz) - *Polish* - [8 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/387599/the-outer-worlds-2-recenzja-gry-chciwosc-kontra-totalitaryzm.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not revolutionize what we saw in the first installment, but it significantly improves on familiar elements. If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Leandro Felippe de Paiva¬†Gomes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10798/leandro-felippe-de-paiva-gomes) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-ps5/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you‚Äôll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avil√©s](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it‚Äôs the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could‚Äôve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It‚Äôs packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that‚Äôll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie‚Äôs Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It‚Äôs pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn‚Äôt Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of¬†The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but¬†TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that¬†[Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed)¬†It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

My team leader made the environment incredibly toxic and discouraging, so I decided it was time for a change. I started learning Unreal Engine through some courses on Udemy, just to see where it could take me.\n\nIn my free time I began building a prototype for a game I always wanted to play: Gunpoint but in 3D. When I felt confident that I wanted to take it further, I quit my toxic job to develop it full time.\n\nSo here it is, Ghost Node, a 3D stealth and hacking game where you play as a freelance hacker infiltrating high security facilities, using a drone to rewire devices and outsmart corporate systems.\n\nAfter months of development the Steam store page is ready and the official trailer as well.\n\nSteam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost\\_Node/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060200/Ghost_Node/)\n\nThanks for reading üôå",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today¬†announced a new partnership¬†with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by¬†Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also¬†just broke¬†that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners‚Äîa group of investors‚Äîwould be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game‚Äôs many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroƒülu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2¬†is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If¬†The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the sameÔªø experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original‚Äôs formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player‚Äôs ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however‚Äîparticularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn‚Äôt a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste ‚Äì it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio‚Äôs vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I‚Äôll admit, there‚Äôs a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options.

Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland‚Äîalmost forgettable‚Äîcompanions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It‚Äôs a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn‚Äôt lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you‚Äôll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in.

The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you‚Äôll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avil√©s](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it‚Äôs the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could‚Äôve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It‚Äôs packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that‚Äôll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer.

However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It‚Äôs pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn‚Äôt Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of¬†The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me.

It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

Games like this remind me why I got into creative work.\n\nAnyone else use story games as a creative reset?\n\n",

Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also¬†just broke¬†that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners‚Äîa group of investors‚Äîwould be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

In battle, you can deploy units alongside you (and give them orders via a tactical pause, if you want), and on a macro level you will seamlessly manage resources, supply lines, capture and defend locations, build structures, and more on a constantly evolving (in real time) strategic map. The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

    "title": "It helps me",
    "selftext": "Guys, I'm new to building a gaming PC and a lot of people say that if you're going to have it, you shouldn't buy it ready-made. I would like your help with many things, such as:\n\nFans: which fan would be good? With or without RGB? From brand to brand do they change the refrigeration quality? I also see people talking about the ones that are silent and that if you are going to buy a fan, let it be like that, because the thing about a bigger or smaller fan and that some are better than others is boring.\n\nRegarding the video card, I wanted a 5060ti 8gb, but I also see a lot of people saying that it is bad, I'm not the type that plays a lot of AAA games, so I really wanted your opinion as more experienced and gamers, of course.\n\nRegarding the processor, I would really like your opinion on putting together an AM5 or AM4 kit, I see a lot of people saying that if I were to build a 4/5k PC, it should be an AM5 platform because it would cost the same price and that I would already be updated for better future upgrades, and on the AM4 platform I thought about a Ryzen 7 5700x and for an AM5 a Ryzen 5 8400F.\n\nThe motherboard would be the same, I see people talking about a B550M aorus elite and they say that a tuf gaming version would be better, about AM5 boards I already forgot the ones I researched, but if you could tell me some I would thank you in advance. I also know that there are cards that don't allow overclocking like the A620, is overclocking really good and necessary? Even for those who will have a video card? I don't know if that has anything to do with it.\n\nRAM memories on the motherboard, if I get a 3200mhz one, but the board has a higher capacity, will it interfere with anything? Does it reduce performance or do I lose greater performance than I could have? SSD follows the same thing, whether NVMe or not.\n\nAbout the cases, there's that thing about ATX, micro etc., I don't know much about it or whether with the configuration I want it would fit into it, I thought about a Vhagar Superframe, Mercury R425 or a Mancer cv500l, I also think about the issue of airflow, would bigger or smaller cases be good? Would the capacity of the number of fans, such as 10 fans, be better for better airflow or is there no such thing as the more the merrier?\n\nWatercooler or Aircooler? Depending on your help with the processor issue, which would be better? I see a lot of people say that the watercooler is just for aesthetics and that it is also better than the Aircooler just for the cooling technology, but I also see that it can \"break\", pierce the tube and fall on the parts, burning the PC, and the Aircooler I see a lot of people say that in addition to lasting longer and being easier to maintain, it tanks a good amount of processors very well, much better than a watercooler of the same price (an example would be those rise mode watercoolers). R$250 and an Aircooler which are in the same price range and even provide better cooling).\n\nMonitors: I wanted a 27p one, but if I want curved, I'll have to sacrifice a few Hz, if I want QHD I'll have to sacrifice a few inches, so the question remains: Would a QHD or an FHD be better? (I don't see any difference, if you can tell me how it works...), Hz I know I'll have to have, is 100hz ok? There are some 27p, 180hz and FHD monitors, would that be ok?\n\nPeripherals: Mouse, keyboard, headset/headphones and Mousepad, does anyone have any recommendations? Not that expensive, but also not that bad in terms of quality.\n\nNOTE: Remembering that I will not buy everything at the real price as I have some promotion groups and I will see what I can buy there. I also don't know if the TAG I chose is right, forgive me if not.",

    "selftext": "I have been trying to find the best way to connect my pc to my tv. I just built my pc with in the last year and now I'm trying to connect it to my living room tv for multi-player games to play with the family. When I first bought my house I ran an hdmi from all 3 floors to the basement an hooked it up with a splitter to my Xbox Series X. Now I have tried hooking my pc up to the hdmi and its laggy as hell. I then used the steam link app on my phone and cast my phone to my tv. This option performs much better but sometimes has no sound and isn't ideal if I want to use my phone. I then bought a SteamLink console and hooked it up. This works but seems to significantly reduce the quality of graphics. Does anyone know of a good solution to get decent graphics and decent performance?",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI have an old PC that used to run Windows 7 and was mainly used for storing backups. It had four HDDs configured in AHCI mode and managed through LDM (Logical Disk Manager). Altogether, the storage capacity was around 9‚Äì10 TB.\n\nUnfortunately, the system drive has completely failed and is no longer visible at all. The four data disks seem intact, but I can‚Äôt access them properly without the original Windows installation.\n\nMy plan was to install a new disk, reinstall Windows 7, and then try to rebuild or re-import the LDM volumes to regain access to the data. However, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the best or safest way to proceed ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to risk damaging the existing structure or data.\n\nI‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on:\n\nWhether reinstalling Windows 7 is a good idea or if I should use another OS/tool instead\n\nThe best way to safely recover or reattach LDM-managed disks\n\nAny recommended software or procedure to detect and mount these disks without risking data loss\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

But, for some strange reason, it keeps telling me it's failed.\n\nI also wrote a comment on the LenovoLegion sub and the LenovoLegion forum on the official site.\n\nI'm unsure what else I can do. Knowing this will always be there when I go to update is going to drive me insane.\n\nI've reinstalled Windows multiple times now. But out of those many times. \n\nI actually SAW!! right next to a button that read 'clean install'.\n\n Meaning it would delete EVERYTHING!! Which I thought I was doing at first. But I guess it was somehow installing a backup from my account on microsoft or something. Nonetheless, I got my laptop back up and running. I actually had the same driver issue with the newly installed Windows 11 Home.  After I did a full fresh install of Windows 11 around 4 or 5 times now. There is no driver issue. \n\nI googled some other options and came across using GPEDIT.msc.\n\nI had to use the command prompt to get it installed. I changed how the updates work now. It will display a button stating Hey you can download the update or not. \n\n  \nMy question is. Since things are GOOD!!! I want to back up my os the way it is right now. Since things are good and the update screen isn't throwing that \"Intel Corporation display 31.0.101.5590 failed to install message.\"\n\n I thought I was doing the right thing by watching a YouTube video on backing up your system.\n\nBut in return, it was only System Image Backup. \n\nBut within one of those many installs of the fresh installation of Windows 11 Home the dreaded driver issue popped up for me. Keep in mind, this was before I got into the GPedit.msc install.   \n  \nI had the System Image Backup, and I thought I would be able to use that, but that didn't work like I wanted it to. \n\n  \nSo I'm on the hunt to make a working image of the my laptop as it sits right now. In  case down the road something goes SOUTH! I can revert back to the way it was... as it is RIGHT NOW!!! \n\nAs of right now, I don't want to install anything on the laptop.\n\nI'd rather back it up first before doing anything else. \n\nBecause I'm just so tired of reinstalling Windows 11 just so I don't get that error.\n\n\n\nThank You.",

And I didn‚Äôt have the cash for a thread ripper. \n\nThis is the first time I do a major upgrade to my computer, feels exciting and nostalgic. I guess I will build a second desktop with my old mob, cpu and the components I have upgraded from my first build over the years. Feels a bit like the ship of theseus",

More recently, I have had them on the top of my desk in a row, clearly not taking much advantage of the stereo/surround sound features.  They have always seemed fine to me, but I had little else to compare them to.  Does anyone else have any experience or thoughts on their quality?\n\nI don't want to spend a ton of money, but have been considering things like the Presonus 3.5, Edifier MR4, and Creative T40.  I would imagine without a subwoofer, the bass would at least be lower, but these will mostly be used for gaming and general computer use.  How would these compare to what I have?  Any other thoughts?  Thanks!",

Also one of the panels of my case is missing when I moved....even though the movers claim it wasn't them. \n\nA new top of the line PC costs around ¬£2500, but looking online the CPU is still very good in todays market, so all I would need is a new case and I am thinking a 5070TI, and maybe a PSU which cuts the price down to ¬£1000. I am worried about moving everything to a new case, as I have only built a pc once and it took almost the whole day to get it running. \n\nIs it easy to move cases? Would I need anything else besides a GPU and maybe a better PSU? I think my main fear is moving everything over and then it doesn't work, and I'd like to have a pc that will be good for the next few years. Any advice would be helpful thank you :) ",

I tried flashing new bios several times, never seemed to confirm success or boot. I contacted Scan, took photos of the assembly showing no socket damage and the error. They instructed to dismantle and return. Removing the CPU I dropped it in the socket causing damage to the pins. It still ended up being sent to MSI, after pointing out it wouldn't have been damaged if it worked in the first place. Returned from MSI claiming testing and working but with some still visible damage to the socket, after a couple of tries of reseating the CPU it eventually worked and loaded windows. \n\nWorked fine for 6 months. I added an extra 32gb of ram and immediately got a CPU error and it failed again. Removing the ram didn't fix the error and it remains broken. \n\nGiven that the socket was returned from MSI with still visible damage to the pins, are they still likely to fix this? Or take it to independent to fix? Or it is new mobo time? ",

Its physically too old to be upgradable to future windows OS and has lived the latter part of its life overheating and struggling to boot like the geriatric it is.\n\nIt kept me in touch with friends during the early days of Facebook, it helped me study, it helped me research and budget my way through university, it brought me joy through gaming into the early hours of the morning, its seen me through financial jams and job interviews, its made custom birthday cards and played movies. It has done its duty and then some, and no one can deny that.\n\nBut the time has finally come. A few weeks ago it stopped booting entirely, powering nothing but the fans in its last gasp.

DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems. On the modern internet, many services, such as cloud computing or streaming, need to be able to assign the same domain to multiple IP addresses in a network, allowing efficient use of geographically distributed servers.\n\n  \nDNS Enactor, a component of DynamoDB responsible for updating these tables, \"experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints.\" While Enactor played catch-up, DynamoDB continued generating new plans for it to follow, which another, on-time DNS Enactor helpfully tried to implement.\n\n  \nThe fresh DNS configuration that resulted was overwritten by a significantly outdated one when the delayed Enactor finally caught up, bypassing a safeguard meant to prevent just such an error which was also experiencing delays. The second, on-time Enactor then deleted the outdated plan altogether, detecting that it was stale. This state of affairs resulted in knock on effects across AWS, requiring engineers to manually diagnose the problem and resolve it.",

Its had a new power supply, new graphics card, 3 generations of windows operating systems (including a few janky OS repairs), 4 new RAM cards, 2 new HD drives and 1 new SD drive. Its physically too old to be upgradable to future windows OS and has lived the latter part of its life overheating and struggling to boot like the geriatric it is.\n\nIt kept me in touch with friends during the early days of Facebook, it helped me study, it helped me research and budget my way through university, it brought me joy through gaming into the early hours of the morning, its seen me through financial jams and job interviews, its made custom birthday cards and played movies. It has done its duty and then some, and no one can deny that.\n\nBut the time has finally come. A few weeks ago it stopped booting entirely, powering nothing but the fans in its last gasp. Its death rattle. Ive done everything I can for it but its had enough. Its time to do one last hard shutdown. Time to finally let it rest and start a new.\n\nBe at peace you absolute champion.",

    "title": "Upgraded my existing build with 9070 XT. No RGB build.",
    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI decided to move away from liquid cooling entirely and went back to basics. Liquid cooling is great but it demands labor, maintenance and, transportation becomes risky and labor intensive. As I have to relocate and move between cities frequently I couldn't handle the extra work.\n\nI upgraded the CPU to 5600X as I got a very good deal on it and purchased a 9070XT. My goal was to be able to play games smoothly at 4K on a newly purchased 4K monitor. I think this build will serve me for a very long time and it's future-proof with FSR4.\n\nI purchased a CPU air cooler as well. CPU cooler is double tower and may seem to be an overkill for a 5600X but I got it at a very good price and it's future-proof with AM5 as well. I chose air cooler over an AIO because these last forever. No risk of leakage or replacement requirement when pump stops working. Also, I could set orientation of one top corner fan as exhaust and one as intake. I learnt this airflow strategy from a Noctua article. I think air coolers are great, as they require little to no maintenance apart from dust cleaning and they last almost forever.\n\nI upgraded the PSU as modern power supplies offer better transient response times and hold-up time. With my older PSU my PC sometimes used to get reset after a power outage as my inverter had a bit higher switch-over time.\n\nI upgraded the motherboard to AsRock B450 PRO4 R2.0. This was only motherboard that I could buy in B450 series and also being old it was available on a very good price. My older motherboard LAN card had become faulty and 1 CPU capacitor was burnt.\n\nAlso upgraded the HDDs to SSDs. That 4-bay 2.5\" SSD mount is 3D printed. And, upgraded the NVMe drive as it had stopped working. Although, PCle 3.0x4 SSDs don't require any additional heatsink but I got one installed anyway. It looks great. This is how storage is planned/utilized for now:\n\n2.5\" 512GB: Windows\n\n2.5\" 512GB: Devuan GNU+Linux\n\n2.5\" 2TB: Windows Storage\n\n2.5\" 2TB: Devuan Storage\n\nNVMe 1TB: I/O intensive games or software.\n\nAll fans (4) on the front side are intake. Top corner fans (2) are exhaust. Installed third additional (3) fan on CPU cooler after ordering mounting clips from Amazon. These clips are not readily available so I used Amazon to import them for a bit higher price. I have added custom cut mesh for every intake fan and gaps.\n\nCase USB panel had gone faulty so I have not attached it.\n\nI have played games for a few hours and ran some benchmarks. Everything looks great. I am calling this build \"The AirWolf\".\n\nIn case anyone wanting to checkout the parts list. Here's a [pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/RsKp99) link.\n\nThank you for checking out my build. Looking forward to the comments and learn more from feedback.",

DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems. On the modern internet, many services, such as cloud computing or streaming, need to be able to assign the same domain to multiple IP addresses in a network, allowing efficient use of geographically distributed servers.\n\n  \nDNS Enactor, a component of DynamoDB responsible for updating these tables, \"experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints.\" While Enactor played catch-up, DynamoDB continued generating new plans for it to follow, which another, on-time DNS Enactor helpfully tried to implement.\n\n  \nThe fresh DNS configuration that resulted was overwritten by a significantly outdated one when the delayed Enactor finally caught up, bypassing a safeguard meant to prevent just such an error which was also experiencing delays. The second, on-time Enactor then deleted the outdated plan altogether, detecting that it was stale. This state of affairs resulted in knock on effects across AWS, requiring engineers to manually diagnose the problem and resolve it.",

But it kept chugging on.\n\nOver the last 14 years it's had everything replaced except the case, motherboard and CPU, and I dont care what Thesius says, its still the same computer at heart. Its had a new power supply, new graphics card, 3 generations of windows operating systems (including a few janky OS repairs), 4 new RAM cards, 2 new HD drives and 1 new SD drive. Its physically too old to be upgradable to future windows OS and has lived the latter part of its life overheating and struggling to boot like the geriatric it is.\n\nIt kept me in touch with friends during the early days of Facebook, it helped me study, it helped me research and budget my way through university, it brought me joy through gaming into the early hours of the morning, its seen me through financial jams and job interviews, its made custom birthday cards and played movies. It has done its duty and then some, and no one can deny that.\n\nBut the time has finally come. A few weeks ago it stopped booting entirely, powering nothing but the fans in its last gasp. Its death rattle. Ive done everything I can for it but its had enough. Its time to do one last hard shutdown. Time to finally let it rest and start a new.\n\nBe at peace you absolute champion.",

Added riser under monitor\n2. Added keybo/mouse pad (my old one, ordered new one to test)\n3. Added a power shelf under the table on the right\n4. FIXED the monitor tilt, more cable management, tucked computer away behind bar\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n1. Waiting on new shelf and plants.\n2. Ordered a pegboard as well for charging station\n3. New larger grey scale mouse pad\n4. Headphones modern stand coming in Monday\n\nThank you all for the recommendations and trolling :P was fun!  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Original Post  \nFinally got around revamping my work station.\n\n* Used the [74\" IKEA Kitchen KIRBY Walnut Veneer Table Top](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/karlby-countertop-for-kitchen-island-walnut-veneer-30297641/#content)\n* Got a welder to custom build legs for me\n* Bought square leg risers to add some height + have padding on the bottom of the feet.\n* Added LED lights from Temu\n* Cable management under the monitor area via Amazon\n* Monitor arm from Amazon as well\n* Yamaha HS7 Monitor + Amazon Stands (I wish the stands were shorter but the smaller ones couldn't handle the weight)\n\nMy computer is tucked in the back under, it doesnt stick out...just an early picture ( I built without lights for the first time thinking I wouldn't care lol, wish I got a sick case, but oh well)\n\nWaiting for blackfriday to get a new chair as the current one is too old.\n\nI wanted to add shelving so I bought one but not sure where to add it lol. The left of the table is a window in the basement that throws off the whole look. I will upload an updated picture but thought I would post this to get some feedback in the meantime!",

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the¬†***Logitech G915 TKL***¬†and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the¬†*G515*¬†with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the¬†***Keychron K1 Max***¬†with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using¬†[launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/)¬†but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use¬†[usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/wzb2GPh\n\nLeobog Hi75c Pro (stock except for keycaps and switches)  \nOsume Night Market keycaps  \nMMD Princess v4 linear switches (stock)  \n[Sound test but does NOT do it justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OokIrbbHVDw)\n\nI was out of the hobby for years until my friend told me about how much they loved their new Leobog Hi75. \nFirst off, I have to say the game has evolved in the past 5 years or so, offering many outstanding stock budget models you previously would have to spend hundreds to replicate. Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing ‚Äúthudding‚Äù. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I‚Äôve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to ‚Äúthud‚Äù. \n\nI‚Äôve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and ‚Äúthudding‚Äù from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB.

You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or ‚Äúmovement‚Äù, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom ‚Äúclacky‚Äù WS Flux HE switches as well as the ‚Äúdeep clacky‚Äù WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

All are connected to my PC at the same time (don‚Äôt ask) and I just grab one depending on what I‚Äôm doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn‚Äôt want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I‚Äôm done!! üòä\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws: ‚ÄÉ\n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

It is now late October, and my order status is still \"Unfulfilled.\"\n\nTo follow up, I sent an email to their customer support on **October 15th** to cancel the order and request a full refund, but I have received no reply.\n\nI also sent them a message on Instagram on **October 19th**. The account has been \"online\" multiple times since I sent it, but they are deliberately ignoring my message.\n\nI recently sent an email to their customer support to cancel the order and request a full refund, but I have received no reply.\n\nAfter getting no response, I did a search and found this thread, which seems to confirm the worst: [Geistmaschine appears to be defunct/exit scamming](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1mq742g/geistmaschine_appears_to_be_defunctexit_scamming/)\n\nAt this point, I'm assuming the company is gone and has taken the money. Has anyone else had a similar experience with them recently?",

    "title": "[RULES UPDATE] Media Only Post, Typing Apps, Games, and Extensions, Combatting Spam",
    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the¬†***Logitech G915 TKL***¬†and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the¬†*G515*¬†with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the¬†***Keychron K1 Max***¬†with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using¬†[launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/)¬†but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use¬†[usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "About a year or two ago, I released the [ScottoFrog (Handwired Edition)](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/macropads/scottofrog-handwired-macropad) which is a completely free-to-build 3D printed macropad based on the [Frogpad](http://frogpad.com). It has the option to be either a single-handed keyboard or a normal macropad, I specifically use my copy of the board for gaming. It has been my most popular board to date in terms of commissions so I decided to make it into a PCB. That said, this is the [PCB Edition](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-pcb-kit) which is available on my shop if people are interested, in addition to the keycaps and 3D printed case. You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use. It basically just relies on **a metric ton** of combos and layers.\n\n",

Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks ‚Äî band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast üôÇ.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me ‚Äî in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn‚Äôt make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they‚Äôll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly ‚Äî The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay‚Äôs voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away ‚Üí Roxette**  \nI‚Äôm still in love with Marie Fredriksson‚Äôs voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 ‚Üí Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele ‚Äî the man, the music, the attitude ‚Äî pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F ‚Üí Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The ‚Äú3‚Äù also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit ‚Äî Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 ‚Üí 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it‚Äôs probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive ‚Üí** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently‚Äôs Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt‚Äôs pure freedom, soul, happiness ‚Äî life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins‚Ä¶ and hopefully Bart‚Äôs story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy ‚Äî build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power ‚Üí N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote ‚Äútuurnn‚Äù next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in ‚Äî just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane ‚Üí** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane ‚Äî the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations ‚Üí** had to be here anyway, but this one‚Äôs a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song‚Äôs energy, Mark‚Äôs wild teenage years, his early work ‚Äî all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we‚Äôre at it‚Ä¶\n\n**P.I.J M.M ‚Üí Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite ‚Äî the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE ‚Üí Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come Through* would‚Äôve been too many ‚Äúdreams‚Äù ‚Äî and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire ‚Üí Scooter (HP Baxxter‚Äôs voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in P√©cs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously ‚Äî the best element!\n\n**Out of Space ‚Üí The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under ‚ÄúSpace‚Äù, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was sent to outer space,‚Äù and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can‚Äôt Stop Raving* didn‚Äôt fit anymore üòÖ.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True ‚Üí** basically the slogan of the ‚Äô90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven‚Äôt outgrown it ‚Äî and honestly, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was never my strong suit üôÇ.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? ‚Üí** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here ‚Äî sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need explaining, but I shouldn‚Äôt forget it either.\n* **NRG** ‚Äî same energy.\n* **Music** ‚Äî the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** ‚Äî clich√©, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** ‚Äî probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** ‚Äî took a while to find. Wanted something that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in boxes,‚Äù kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** ‚Äî because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** ‚Äî as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** ‚Äî one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny ‚Äú-drive,‚Äù because if it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn‚Äôt stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches‚Ä¶ the works.\n\nThat‚Äôs about all that fit ‚Äî for now.  \nI‚Äôve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer ‚Äî brush smears the paint, and I don‚Äôt want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the¬†***Logitech G915 TKL***¬†and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the¬†*G515*¬†with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the¬†***Keychron K1 Max***¬†with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using¬†[launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/)¬†but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use¬†[usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

    "selftext": "If you want to run 4K on a 2K monitor like the **LG 27GX700A-B**, but the game limits your monitor‚Äôs refresh rate at 4K, here‚Äôs how to fix it:\n\n# Steps:\n\n1. **Turn off DSR in NVIDIA Control Panel** first.\n2. Open **CRU (Custom Resolution Utility)**.\n3. Go to **CTA-861 ‚Üí 1 Detailed Resolution ‚Üí 7 Data Blocks**.\n4. **Delete the TV resolutions** from the list.\n5. Run **restart64.exe** (included in CRU) to restart the graphics driver.\n6. Open **NVIDIA Control Panel** again.\n7. Enable **DSR** at 4K for your games.\n\n>\n\n# Why this works:\n\n* The resolutions that come with the monitor (the ‚ÄúTV resolutions‚Äù in CRU) **interfere with NVIDIA DSR**.\n* If they remain, the GPU cannot fully render 4K internally, and it **limits refresh rates** (Hz) or causes zoom/scaling issues in games.\n* Deleting these entries removes conflicts, allowing DSR to work properly.\n* Restarting the driver applies the changes.\n* Now your GPU can render **4K internally** and downscale it to 2K correctly, giving you sharp images and correct refresh rates.\n\n# Tips:\n\n* Always back up your CRU profile before making changes.\n* Test games individually; some need desktop at 4K, others just handle it internally.\n* Works for monitors like **LG 27GX700A-B** and should also work for other 2K panels supporting DSR.\n* Using **Fullscreen Exclusive mode** in games usually ensures correct refresh rates and proper downscaling.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been rocking an Acer Predator Z35P for the past 8 years and I'm finally looking to upgrade to an HDR-enabled monitor. After extensive research, I've narrowed it down to the TCL 34R83Q for both programming and gaming (I'm avoiding OLED due to burn-in concerns).\n\nThat monitor launched around April 2024, so it's been out for 18 months, yet I cannot find any proper long-term reviews. TCL is also relatively unknown in monitors, which bothers me since I'm planning to keep this for 6+ years.\n\nSo I've got a few questions for actual owners:\n\n* Any issues after 6+ months of daily use? If so, have there been firmware updates from TCL to fix these?\n* I've read about flickering/blinkink/VRR troubles... is this Nvidia-specific or also AMD? I'll also be buying a new GPU, currently hesitating between 9070 XT or 5070 Ti.\n* G-Sync-compatibility: is this user-proof? I read about unreliability in one review, perhaps just an isolated case...\n* Are there any issues with blooming/uniformity or dead pixel after 1y+ usage?\n\nIt's currently at 699 EUR on amazon, which seems like good value, but only if it actually lasts. Any real-world experiences would be helpful.\n\nThanks!",

Color saturation was a bit weird (especially for an OLED) no matter how much I tweak with the settings, but otherwise it served me well.\n\nAround August, 9 months after purchase, I noticed some weird glitching at the bottom of the panel. I thought it might be a problem with my PC, thought after days of troubleshooting, I realized the problem was with the monitor since using a different cable with a my old laptop still didn't solve the issue. I contacted AOC about this since then thought various methods, from their official website to their email but with no response, and the issue is only getting worse, because on late August black horizontal bars are all over the monitor and on September 16 the monitor started to black screens every 15 seconds or so for around 4 seconds.\n\nThe warranty I got is 4 years of no dead pixels, 4 years of advanced replacement and a year of free replacement for accidental damage, and with my luck so far I'm sure their gonna find something to get them to have it go under user-damage, and I only got 4 weeks until that expires.\n\n\nWhat hurts is that I spent a lot to ship this monitor to my region and that I sacrificed some of the GPU budget to squeeze in that OLED panel so I guess the moral of the story is don't ship monitors overseas and prioritize performance over display for gaming if you can't stretch your budget\n\n",

This is my first IPS monitor so I'm not sure how I feel about the constant noticeable backlighting I can see. (couple screenshots to show what it looks like on camera, which looks way worse in camera than with my human eyes)\n\nI'm doing my best to research and learn about monitors and their features, but admittedly I am still very ignorant.\n\nI came from a Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 and I think the biggest thing I didn't like about that was the ghosting around test and the cursor (which I believe is probably from the fact it was a VA panel?)\n\nI'm not noticing that ghosting issue at all with this MSI IPS monitor, but I'm curious if maybe something like that Innocn GA27T1M being a mini-LED IPS would maybe be that sweet spot?\n\nAlso before I bought the MSI, I tried the new [ASUS XG27UCDMG](https://www.bestbuy.com/product/asus-rog-strix-27-4k-oled-240hz-0-03ms-gaming-monitor-with-freesync-premium-pro-and-hdr-displayport-hdmi-black/JJGGLQ5XSP) and I think I've ultimately decided that OLED is not for me. They're just too dark for my enjoyment.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or recommendations on a 27\" or 32\" 2K or 4K non-OLED monitor, I'd be happy to hear :)\n\nThank you everyone for your time and your advice, and have a great day!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4zkk5almexf1.jpg?width=2104&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70872b4582234ddc7679524a3171700fac0bdeec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yobs5almexf1.jpg?width=1404&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db59b9e83443a78b0914d0fce1e13bfd086a8924",

I'd like to hear your thoughts.\n\nSince pixel shift draws a slightly smaller image within my panel and then shifts that around (which, by the way I notice. EVERY time it does it.) this means that either the panel isnt 1440p but bigger, or the displayed image is smaller than 1440p.\n\nI paid for a monitor with a resolution of 2560x1440 and I would like to think that I get to use all of those pixles at the same time without having to \"bunch\" my image by even a fraction of a percent and have 2 rows of pixels merging/overriding each other.\n\nIt doesn't sit well with me to know I'm at no point ever using the entire panel at once which has the specified resolution. I surely cannot be alone with that. I'd like to turn pixel shift off.\n\nIs there a firmware version out there that lets me turn it off? Is my assumption about the panel wrong? Do you have thoughts or opinions to share about burn-in risks without pixel shift? Please let me know.\n\n  \nEdit: Downvoted to zero for a simple question with zero fluff or bullshit. Now nobody that might have valuable input can see this post. Thanks guys",

If I increased the refresh rate beyond 60 all the colors would become sharper, which isn't inherently bad, but in some games the colors would become so dark it was almost unplayable, and I wasn't able to find any setting on the monitor itself to change the color mode. Not saying I expect this to be the case with all monitors, just saying this was my experience with my first high refresh rate monitor which is why I'm currently not fuzzy about high refresh rates. ",

Used my iphone 16 PM as well lol.¬†\n\n[Proof!](https://preview.redd.it/jqjmjoq0ndxf1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b3b88da3874fcf3f64fdc764c7546dbe17adb33)\n\n**GPU: RX 9070xt**  \n**OS:** Linux (CachyOS) and Windows 11 Pro 24H2.  \n**Connection:** OEM Included DP cables.  \n**Games Tested**: Stalker 2, Arc Raiders Playtest, The finals, BF6, Factorio, Halo Infinite, Returnal.\n\n# Quality:\n\n* **Stand:** The MSI stand is interesting because it feels expensive yet cheap. I think the metal base and looks make it seem high quality but the plastics feel a little cheap and the height adjustment is a little disappointing. It goes about half an inch lower than the KTC and monitors unboxed mentioned this. The MSI's rotating and pivoting feels good. No issues there. Definitely feels higher quality than KTC. The KTC feels a little flimsier and has less friction overall which doesn‚Äôt feel as luxurious, but it gets the job done. KTC is all plastic, no metal base.\n* **Joystick:** The MSI is on another level here. The texture on the button is nice and it‚Äôs firm and tactile. Definitely feels like when you first use the Xbox Elite series controller. Everything feels tight. It‚Äôs also lit, so that‚Äôs kinda nice. The KTC is again flimsy and¬†honestly feels like it‚Äôs been used for years. It literally has stick drift brand new and it‚Äôs also in the back instead of the bottom so it‚Äôs harder to reach.¬†\n\n# Monitor Build/looks:\n\nAgain the MSI wins hands down Looks better from the back, the chin doesn‚Äôt bother me. Creaking and build quality seems similar.\n\n# Accessories:\n\nThe MSI has white cables which is nice. I don‚Äôt really care but if you do it‚Äôs a nice add on. Although the MSI cables feel a little short. KTC are black and again fine. Both have the usb type b as the KVM but the msi has a slightly different shaped plug. Not sure what‚Äôs up with that. Ports are fine.¬†\n\n# Software:\n\nMSI wins in some areas and KTC in others. As I said before, it has better customization. It has more crosshairs and the crosshair changes color. You can also update the firmware so there is optimism if anything needs to be fixed and in my experience something does seriously need to get fixed. But I‚Äôll get to that later. You can customize which quick setting is set for each of the four directions. And dual mode is accessible with 2 button clicks. The MSI also has a desktop app so you can configure it there. Pretty nice.¬† The ktc is non customizable and dual mode has to be dug in the settings. BUT, you can actually control gamma, hue, and saturation on it. In case you need to make adjustments with that. It also has more HDR modes. I kept it on the Vesa one the whole time. Keep in mind the KTC likely will not have hardware updates. On their website it says firmware is final, so that‚Äôs a little concerning.¬†\n\n# Dual Monitor:\n\nWould not recommend the 1080 mode on either. It‚Äôs so blurry imo. I have 3 1080p 27 inch monitors for work and they are much clearer. I had to play some games with AA off to make it more bearable. Or maybe TAA and Non Integer scaling don‚Äôt work for me. Too fuzzy and made my eyes strain and my head hurt. You might be ok.¬†\n\n# Now the Good Stuff!\n\n# Response:\n\nIn SDR the input lag is imperceptible to me on both displays. And it seems in professional testing that it‚Äôs around 5 ms without Local Dimming so it‚Äôs not really an issue. Felt snappy and didn‚Äôt notice any issues at 4k 60hz or 4k 120HZ+.\n\nIn HDR, it was a little difficult. I feel like it was just barely close enough to not feel it. What I mean is, you get used to it so fast since it‚Äôs so small, if you can feel it. This is unlike frame gen which adds significant input lag and I can feel it every time. So, HDR or Local Dimming in SDR had no issues with input lag on both monitors. It felt fine to me running at mostly 120fps+ on the competitive games I played (The Finals, Arc Raiders Playtest, BF6). YMMV.\n\n# Brightness:\n\nIn SDR, the ktc gets significantly brighter. It easily outshines the MSI. The MSI by comparison looks a little bit dull. I find that confusing as it‚Äôs the same panel and it‚Äôs SDR, neither is hitting 1000+ nits. The MSI felt around 400 nits, the KTC felt maybe close to double which is crazy. They both get low enough to not have any issues in the dark.¬†\n\nIn HDR, I had weird issues. When running 2 monitors at HDR on windows, it seemed to prefer the MSI all the time. It worked well with auto HDR, and was brighter than the KTC consistently. Which made no sense as the KTC 100 percent is brighter on other platforms. Could be because I have an amd card or could just be KTC and windows. I tried HDMI, DP, different cables, different ports, and updated to 25H2 to see if it was fixed. YMMV.¬†\n\nIn Linux and on my Chromecast, the KTC gets what seems 30-50% brighter than the MSI consistently. The MSI is good, but the KTC actually blows you away a bit and easily destroys my LG CX.¬†\n\nReally only used Linux to A/B test with Windows for some of the issues I had. Didn‚Äôt play games since Linux HDR support is iffy.¬†\n\n# HDR Color:\n\nThis is the point where hopefully I don‚Äôt get called a hypocrite. If you look at my comment history I recommended the E16M consistently once I got it. But I was mistaken. At first when I received the MSI, I thought the KTC looked washed out and overbrightened. But really the MSI is saturated, unnaturally so.¬† Even when trying to dull everything down with HDR calibration and the ODS settings. The greens on the MSI look too green. The trees, grass, and plants are too vibrant. The reds are too red.¬† Dirt, house colors, the sun, even the color of an owl looks to yellowy/orange. Watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s), the sunsets look too deeply red. Not at all like real life. The houses at 13:43 don‚Äôt look a pale, sun beaten orange. It seems like somebody dropped a bit of highlighter red on them and they pop too much. At 5:31 the yellow line on the road looks too orangey-yellowish. I know what those lines look like in real life and they don‚Äôt look red shifted. Feels like I‚Äôm looking at a Samsung AMOLED from like 10 years ago with the vivid setting set to max. I tried everything, updated the firmware, calibrated, changed cables, changed OS‚Äôs, installed the msi driver, used the icc profile from msi, tried the desktop software to try and force the movie preset for more accuracy. I even changed the saturation and color on amd‚Äôs adrenalin. Nothing fixed it. It happens in both linux, windows, and my Chromecast so I know it‚Äôs the panel/firmware/calibration. It‚Äôs very unfortunate because once you catch it in a video or movie. It really irks you that the colors are unrealistic.\n\nFunnily it helps BF6 not look washed out, but it's not good for more regular naturally lit content.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the KTC destroys the MSI in colors, especially in HDR. Compared to my OLED TV and OLED iphone 16PM, the KTC is basically the same. The colors are accurate and realistic in HDR. And the brightness is freaking awesome. The problem is the KTC is not detected by auto HDR usually, and is very wonky with Windows. So it's hard to test video games that don't have native HDR. The MSI was consistently using auto HDR which was awesome for me since I don‚Äôt have an Nvidia gpu.¬†\n\nAlso, at really bright, white scenes, the MSI loses detail. On a scene with a white cat laying down on top of a white blanket, the MSI is just overblown white on the blanket, while KTC preserves detail and you can see the individual blanket strings and the reflections at the tips.¬†\n\n# SDR colors:\n\nIn SDR the panels are very close, although the MSI is slightly saturated still. But it would be passable. It seems they are suitable for professional work due to the clamping down. The sRGB modes looked identical to me.¬†\n\nNote: Don‚Äôt touch the ‚Äúpremium color‚Äù gaming option on the MSI at HDR. All the saturation gets even worse and looks horribly overcolored. in SDR, it's ok. Makes everything pop a lot.\n\n# HDR Contrast/Blooming:\n\nBlooming is handled better by the MSI. It‚Äôs not a stomping, but the MSI gets a bit darker and has a bit less blooming. This is probably related to the brightness with the KTC being brighter. Although blooming is still well controlled, just not as excellently as the MSI. It's actually difficult to notice blooming on the MSI sometimes. It‚Äôs there but you have to pay attention to it. Once you play or watch a video you‚Äôll never notice it again unless it's the youtube video menu's at the edge. I think since those are at the edge and because they cover so much they can be more noticeable. The KTC is close but you can see it a little easier. TBH, neither broke immersion or caused any issues. It‚Äôs just whether you want better contrast and less eye searing light scenes or slightly worse contrast but blinding bright snow scenes. Both do well. Although I have to say, the MSI only does this well on the highest LD setting, the other two settings still have that IPS glow. The KTC has 3 levels and all show what you expect of Mini-LED just at different aggressiveness with the brightness suffering at the highest level.\n\nNote: You can use LD in SDR content but you have to be comfortable with haloing and artifacting around text. Especially on grey backgrounds like youtube, steam, etc..¬†\n\n# Productivity:\n\nBoth are awesome for this. IPS at 4k 27 inch. Text is perfect and no eyestrain. Whites on the KTC are actually white though. The MSI are grayish white it seems again. I think my panel is borked. Or could be brightness issues again, but the MSI does not look white. Even after calibration and on full brightness\n\n# Issues:¬†\n\n**MSI:** Actually I would‚Äôve kept the MSI if color reproduction was good and whites we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ white. It worked every time with windows and auto HDR actually worked consistently. Never had issues with games or playing anything. The software is nice too along with the desktop app. It‚Äôs really just the color inaccuracy which is unacceptable. I think something was definitely wrong with it but not enough to not be sent out. Annoying.¬†\n\n**KTC:** It didn‚Äôt play that well with windows. HDR colors looked washed out on the desktop and auto HDR only turned on in a couple of games as opposed to MSI. If it was consistent, this is a killer panel and awesome monitor. The colors and brightness are exactly what you expect out of this type of tech. I‚Äôm kinda sad I couldn‚Äôt keep this one tbh‚Ä¶..\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAt the end of the day. Neither of the monitors worked out for me for different issues. The KSI has the better panel (or calibration), the MSI the better software. I think I‚Äôll be returning them both and going back to my dual 1440p fast IPS monitors. I can‚Äôt justify spending half a rack for something that doesn‚Äôt work right and waiting for hopefully some update that fixes it. I‚Äôll wait to see if things are ironed out and maybe try again at a later date. OLED is a no go for me since I do development work and supposed eye strain. I hope this helps and if you buy either, I hope you have no issues.¬†\n\nLet me know if you want to know anything else. I‚Äôll be returning them within the next week so I can answer any questions while they are on my desk. AND if you have any suggestions for solutions. I‚Äôm open to it!\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n\nEdit: you can actually customize the joystick quick settings on the KTC. So that‚Äôs nice. You can set the dual mode to either the left, right, or down. ",

No matter if ACM is on or off, all colors are oversaturated. I don't want to use the sRGB mode of the monitor or clamp the whole OS to sRGB via GPU driver because when I don't want to change all the settings every time I consume content with a wide gamut. \n\nWhat do I have to do to got accurate colors? I noticed that with HDR enabled it looks a lot better, still more saturated but better. Small follow-up question on that topic, how can I check if the HDR output is correct? DisplayCAL does not support HDR, and I'm not sure if it is a bit more vibrant because the creator of the HDR content actually intended it, or if it is more vibrant because the HDR mode of my monitor is oversaturated.",

    "selftext": "The sharpness setting on this monitor seems to be a bit too modest. Many other monitors I had had lowest = ridiculously blurred to highest = very oversharpened. This, however, feels like 0=pretty blurry to 10=somewhat sharp, but even at 10 it's blurry for me sometimes. Tried 125% scaling, 150% - no luck. Used 1440p at 100% from this distance and never had anything wrong. Blurry only on Windows UI and desktop apps, nothing bad in games or videos. Seems like increasing brightness helps, but I can't use high brightbess at night since it's too bright.\n\nAlso, all not-desktop-monitor screens I ever had had the setting and it was never a problem. It seems like it becomes blurry randomly (or is it me?)",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm finally getting the chance to upgrade my 4K 60hz monitor that I‚Äôve had for 8 years now. I personally don‚Äôt know much about monitors so I thought I‚Äôd get some insight from the more experienced folks here.\n\nI‚Äôm just a casual user and won‚Äôt be doing anything fancy with the monitor, but I wanted to get the best option and was hoping for it to last several years. \n\nJust to give you an idea:\n* I‚Äôll be using it 6-8 hours daily (maybe 12-14 hours on some of my days off)\n* 30% casual gaming on a PS5 or docked Switch 2\n* 20% media consumption (YouTube, Netflix, etc.)\n* 50% mixed usage on a Mac Mini (internet browsing, studying, the occasional powerpoint presentation)\n\nAt first I wanted to spoil myself and get the best screen out there and was eyeing the Asus ROG Swift PG27UCDM (I know it‚Äôs overkill for what I‚Äôll be using it for but I liked it lol). I‚Äôve watched a couple of YouTube reviews and saw there was the possibility of burn-in with OLEDs, especially with mixed use. This gave me some concerns for when I‚Äôll be using it with the Mac Mini where I‚Äôll have static images and toolbars constantly present on the screen for hours. \n\nAn alternative option I had was Mini-LED. From the reviews I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs the next best thing in terms of image quality and doesn‚Äôt have the downsides of potential burn-in with mixed use. The monitor I was considering was the MSI MPG 274URDFW E16. It had good reviews, offers more than what I actually need and is less than half the price of the Asus. But, it‚Äôs not an OLED. \n\nI really had my heart set on an OLED, so am I being too paranoid about burn-in and should just go for it? Should I go with the more sensible option with the MSI? Or is there any different option you would suggest instead?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated :)",

    "title": "MSI MPG 274URDFW E16M vs KTC M27P6 Comparison:",
    "selftext": "Hey ya‚Äôll, I finally got around to making this review/comparison. I‚Äôm currently running side by side mounted on their stands. Please note I have no professional equipment and this is all just side by side comparison. I did come from a nice IPS display that was an omen 27qs and I have an LG CX oled TV for comparison. Used my iphone 16 PM as well lol.¬†\n\n[Proof!](https://preview.redd.it/jqjmjoq0ndxf1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b3b88da3874fcf3f64fdc764c7546dbe17adb33)\n\n**GPU: RX 9070xt**  \n**OS:** Linux (CachyOS) and Windows 11 Pro 24H2.  \n**Connection:** OEM Included DP cables.  \n**Games Tested**: Stalker 2, Arc Raiders Playtest, The finals, BF6, Factorio, Halo Infinite, Returnal.\n\n# Quality:\n\n* **Stand:** The MSI stand is interesting because it feels expensive yet cheap. I think the metal base and looks make it seem high quality but the plastics feel a little cheap and the height adjustment is a little disappointing. It goes about half an inch lower than the KTC and monitors unboxed mentioned this. The MSI's rotating and pivoting feels good. No issues there. Definitely feels higher quality than KTC. The KTC feels a little flimsier and has less friction overall which doesn‚Äôt feel as luxurious, but it gets the job done. KTC is all plastic, no metal base.\n* **Joystick:** The MSI is on another level here. The texture on the button is nice and it‚Äôs firm and tactile. Definitely feels like when you first use the Xbox Elite series controller. Everything feels tight. It‚Äôs also lit, so that‚Äôs kinda nice. The KTC is again flimsy and¬†honestly feels like it‚Äôs been used for years. It literally has stick drift brand new and it‚Äôs also in the back instead of the bottom so it‚Äôs harder to reach.¬†\n\n# Monitor Build/looks:\n\nAgain the MSI wins hands down Looks better from the back, the chin doesn‚Äôt bother me. Creaking and build quality seems similar.\n\n# Accessories:\n\nThe MSI has white cables which is nice. I don‚Äôt really care but if you do it‚Äôs a nice add on. Although the MSI cables feel a little short. KTC are black and again fine. Both have the usb type b as the KVM but the msi has a slightly different shaped plug. Not sure what‚Äôs up with that. Ports are fine.¬†\n\n# Software:\n\nMSI wins in some areas and KTC in others. As I said before, it has better customization. It has more crosshairs and the crosshair changes color. You can also update the firmware so there is optimism if anything needs to be fixed and in my experience something does seriously need to get fixed. But I‚Äôll get to that later. You can customize which quick setting is set for each of the four directions. And dual mode is accessible with 2 button clicks. The MSI also has a desktop app so you can configure it there. Pretty nice.¬† The ktc is non customizable and dual mode has to be dug in the settings. BUT, you can actually control gamma, hue, and saturation on it. In case you need to make adjustments with that. It also has more HDR modes. I kept it on the Vesa one the whole time. Keep in mind the KTC likely will not have hardware updates. On their website it says firmware is final, so that‚Äôs a little concerning.¬†\n\n# Dual Monitor:\n\nWould not recommend the 1080 mode on either. It‚Äôs so blurry imo. I have 3 1080p 27 inch monitors for work and they are much clearer. I had to play some games with AA off to make it more bearable. Or maybe TAA and Non Integer scaling don‚Äôt work for me. Too fuzzy and made my eyes strain and my head hurt. You might be ok.¬†\n\n# Now the Good Stuff!\n\n# Response:\n\nIn SDR the input lag is imperceptible to me on both displays. And it seems in professional testing that it‚Äôs around 5 ms without Local Dimming so it‚Äôs not really an issue. Felt snappy and didn‚Äôt notice any issues at 4k 60hz or 4k 120HZ+.\n\nIn HDR, it was a little difficult. I feel like it was just barely close enough to not feel it. What I mean is, you get used to it so fast since it‚Äôs so small, if you can feel it. This is unlike frame gen which adds significant input lag and I can feel it every time. So, HDR or Local Dimming in SDR had no issues with input lag on both monitors. It felt fine to me running at mostly 120fps+ on the competitive games I played (The Finals, Arc Raiders Playtest, BF6). YMMV.\n\n# Brightness:\n\nIn SDR, the ktc gets significantly brighter. It easily outshines the MSI. The MSI by comparison looks a little bit dull. I find that confusing as it‚Äôs the same panel and it‚Äôs SDR, neither is hitting 1000+ nits. The MSI felt around 400 nits, the KTC felt maybe close to double which is crazy. They both get low enough to not have any issues in the dark.¬†\n\nIn HDR, I had weird issues. When running 2 monitors at HDR on windows, it seemed to prefer the MSI all the time. It worked well with auto HDR, and was brighter than the KTC consistently. Which made no sense as the KTC 100 percent is brighter on other platforms. Could be because I have an amd card or could just be KTC and windows. I tried HDMI, DP, different cables, different ports, and updated to 25H2 to see if it was fixed. YMMV.¬†\n\nIn Linux and on my Chromecast, the KTC gets what seems 30-50% brighter than the MSI consistently. The MSI is good, but the KTC actually blows you away a bit and easily destroys my LG CX.¬†\n\nReally only used Linux to A/B test with Windows for some of the issues I had. Didn‚Äôt play games since Linux HDR support is iffy.¬†\n\n# HDR Color:\n\nThis is the point where hopefully I don‚Äôt get called a hypocrite. If you look at my comment history I recommended the E16M consistently once I got it. But I was mistaken. At first when I received the MSI, I thought the KTC looked washed out and overbrightened. But really the MSI is saturated, unnaturally so.¬† Even when trying to dull everything down with HDR calibration and the ODS settings. The greens on the MSI look too green. The trees, grass, and plants are too vibrant. The reds are too red.¬† Dirt, house colors, the sun, even the color of an owl looks to yellowy/orange. Watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s), the sunsets look too deeply red. Not at all like real life. The houses at 13:43 don‚Äôt look a pale, sun beaten orange. It seems like somebody dropped a bit of highlighter red on them and they pop too much. At 5:31 the yellow line on the road looks too orangey-yellowish. I know what those lines look like in real life and they don‚Äôt look red shifted. Feels like I‚Äôm looking at a Samsung AMOLED from like 10 years ago with the vivid setting set to max. I tried everything, updated the firmware, calibrated, changed cables, changed OS‚Äôs, installed the msi driver, used the icc profile from msi, tried the desktop software to try and force the movie preset for more accuracy. I even changed the saturation and color on amd‚Äôs adrenalin. Nothing fixed it. It happens in both linux, windows, and my Chromecast so I know it‚Äôs the panel/firmware/calibration. It‚Äôs very unfortunate because once you catch it in a video or movie. It really irks you that the colors are unrealistic.\n\nFunnily it helps BF6 not look washed out, but it's not good for more regular naturally lit content.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the KTC destroys the MSI in colors, especially in HDR. Compared to my OLED TV and OLED iphone 16PM, the KTC is basically the same. The colors are accurate and realistic in HDR. And the brightness is freaking awesome. The problem is the KTC is not detected by auto HDR usually, and is very wonky with Windows. So it's hard to test video games that don't have native HDR. The MSI was consistently using auto HDR which was awesome for me since I don‚Äôt have an Nvidia gpu.¬†\n\nAlso, at really bright, white scenes, the MSI loses detail. On a scene with a white cat laying down on top of a white blanket, the MSI is just overblown white on the blanket, while KTC preserves detail and you can see the individual blanket strings and the reflections at the tips.¬†\n\n# SDR colors:\n\nIn SDR the panels are very close, although the MSI is slightly saturated still. But it would be passable. It seems they are suitable for professional work due to the clamping down. The sRGB modes looked identical to me.¬†\n\nNote: Don‚Äôt touch the ‚Äúpremium color‚Äù gaming option on the MSI at HDR. All the saturation gets even worse and looks horribly overcolored. in SDR, it's ok. Makes everything pop a lot.\n\n# HDR Contrast/Blooming:\n\nBlooming is handled better by the MSI. It‚Äôs not a stomping, but the MSI gets a bit darker and has a bit less blooming. This is probably related to the brightness with the KTC being brighter. Although blooming is still well controlled, just not as excellently as the MSI. It's actually difficult to notice blooming on the MSI sometimes. It‚Äôs there but you have to pay attention to it. Once you play or watch a video you‚Äôll never notice it again unless it's the youtube video menu's at the edge. I think since those are at the edge and because they cover so much they can be more noticeable. The KTC is close but you can see it a little easier. TBH, neither broke immersion or caused any issues. It‚Äôs just whether you want better contrast and less eye searing light scenes or slightly worse contrast but blinding bright snow scenes. Both do well. Although I have to say, the MSI only does this well on the highest LD setting, the other two settings still have that IPS glow. The KTC has 3 levels and all show what you expect of Mini-LED just at different aggressiveness with the brightness suffering at the highest level.\n\nNote: You can use LD in SDR content but you have to be comfortable with haloing and artifacting around text. Especially on grey backgrounds like youtube, steam, etc..¬†\n\n# Productivity:\n\nBoth are awesome for this. IPS at 4k 27 inch. Text is perfect and no eyestrain. Whites on the KTC are actually white though. The MSI are grayish white it seems again. I think my panel is borked. Or could be brightness issues again, but the MSI does not look white. Even after calibration and on full brightness\n\n# Issues:¬†\n\n**MSI:** Actually I would‚Äôve kept the MSI if color reproduction was good and whites we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ white. It worked every time with windows and auto HDR actually worked consistently. Never had issues with games or playing anything. The software is nice too along with the desktop app. It‚Äôs really just the color inaccuracy which is unacceptable. I think something was definitely wrong with it but not enough to not be sent out. Annoying.¬†\n\n**KTC:** It didn‚Äôt play that well with windows. HDR colors looked washed out on the desktop and auto HDR only turned on in a couple of games as opposed to MSI. If it was consistent, this is a killer panel and awesome monitor. The colors and brightness are exactly what you expect out of this type of tech. I‚Äôm kinda sad I couldn‚Äôt keep this one tbh‚Ä¶..\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAt the end of the day. Neither of the monitors worked out for me for different issues. The KSI has the better panel (or calibration), the MSI the better software. I think I‚Äôll be returning them both and going back to my dual 1440p fast IPS monitors. I can‚Äôt justify spending half a rack for something that doesn‚Äôt work right and waiting for hopefully some update that fixes it. I‚Äôll wait to see if things are ironed out and maybe try again at a later date. OLED is a no go for me since I do development work and supposed eye strain. I hope this helps and if you buy either, I hope you have no issues.¬†\n\nLet me know if you want to know anything else. I‚Äôll be returning them within the next week so I can answer any questions while they are on my desk. AND if you have any suggestions for solutions. I‚Äôm open to it!\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n\nEdit: you can actually customize the joystick quick settings on the KTC. So that‚Äôs nice. You can set the dual mode to either the left, right, or down. ",

Playing games is not the objective, instead support for hours doing programming, so text clarity and good colors in static screen is the idea.\n\nPlus could be eye-care protecion. \n\nI found these two:\n\nASUS ROG Strix 27‚Äù 4K HDR400 USB-C Gaming Monitor(XG27UCS)‚ÄìUHD (3840 x 2160), 160Hz, 1ms, Fast IPS,130% sRGB,Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync, G-Sync Compatible, DisplayWidget, Tripod socket. \n\nThis one costs 350 USD, seems good but I'm not sure if it is good for static screen usage, ie for office use.\n\nDell 27 Plus 4K Monitor - S2725QS - 27-inch 4K (3840 x 2160) 120Hz 16:9 Display, IPS Panel, AMD FreeSync Premium, sRGB 99%, Integrated Speakers, 1500:1 Contrast Ratio, Comfortview Plus - Ash White\n\nThis one costs 240 USD, seems to met my requirements, but the question is: are there any monitor like this with better specs below my budget ?\n\nFinally I'm aware that there are monitors for coding like BenQ but those are out of my budgets and have 60 Hz refresh rate.\n\nIf I said something wrong, or you are aware of some other monitor that could fit, or you have some advice for me, please let me know.

    "selftext": "TL;DR: just ranting over AOC being the type of guy who leaves you on delivered while they're online\n\nI bought a monitor from them during black Friday last year when I saw a nice OLED deal for 400$ (not including tax) for a PC build I was planning. Color saturation was a bit weird (especially for an OLED) no matter how much I tweak with the settings, but otherwise it served me well.\n\nAround August, 9 months after purchase, I noticed some weird glitching at the bottom of the panel. I thought it might be a problem with my PC, thought after days of troubleshooting, I realized the problem was with the monitor since using a different cable with a my old laptop still didn't solve the issue. I contacted AOC about this since then thought various methods, from their official website to their email but with no response, and the issue is only getting worse, because on late August black horizontal bars are all over the monitor and on September 16 the monitor started to black screens every 15 seconds or so for around 4 seconds.\n\nThe warranty I got is 4 years of no dead pixels, 4 years of advanced replacement and a year of free replacement for accidental damage, and with my luck so far I'm sure their gonna find something to get them to have it go under user-damage, and I only got 4 weeks until that expires.\n\n\nWhat hurts is that I spent a lot to ship this monitor to my region and that I sacrificed some of the GPU budget to squeeze in that OLED panel so I guess the moral of the story is don't ship monitors overseas and prioritize performance over display for gaming if you can't stretch your budget\n\n",

    "selftext": "If you want to run 4K on a 2K monitor like the **LG 27GX700A-B**, but the game limits your monitor‚Äôs refresh rate at 4K, here‚Äôs how to fix it:\n\n# Steps:\n\n1. **Turn off DSR in NVIDIA Control Panel** first.\n2. Open **CRU (Custom Resolution Utility)**.\n3. Go to **CTA-861 ‚Üí 1 Detailed Resolution ‚Üí 7 Data Blocks**.\n4. **Delete the TV resolutions** from the list.\n5. Run **restart64.exe** (included in CRU) to restart the graphics driver.\n6. Open **NVIDIA Control Panel** again.\n7. Enable **DSR** at 4K for your games.\n\n>\n\n# Why this works:\n\n* The resolutions that come with the monitor (the ‚ÄúTV resolutions‚Äù in CRU) **interfere with NVIDIA DSR**.\n* If they remain, the GPU cannot fully render 4K internally, and it **limits refresh rates** (Hz) or causes zoom/scaling issues in games.\n* Deleting these entries removes conflicts, allowing DSR to work properly.\n* Restarting the driver applies the changes.\n* Now your GPU can render **4K internally** and downscale it to 2K correctly, giving you sharp images and correct refresh rates.\n\n# Tips:\n\n* Always back up your CRU profile before making changes.\n* Test games individually; some need desktop at 4K, others just handle it internally.\n* Works for monitors like **LG 27GX700A-B** and should also work for other 2K panels supporting DSR.\n* Using **Fullscreen Exclusive mode** in games usually ensures correct refresh rates and proper downscaling.",

Thunderbolt 4 (DisplayPort 1.4 DSC).\n\nI‚Äôm deciding between running **two QHD (2560√ó1440) monitors at 120‚Äì144 Hz**, or **two 4K monitors**, where realistically one would run at **120 Hz (via TB4)** and the other at **60 Hz (via HDMI)**.\n\nMy main use: **1) home office work, 2) occasional video editing, and 3) very occasional gaming** (I could use 1 screen for this, and would be fine with playing at a lower resolution than 4k if necessary).\n\n  \n**My questions:**\n\n* How noticeable is the **refresh-rate mismatch** (120 Hz + 60 Hz) in real use ‚Äî cursor movement, window dragging, and smoothness ‚Äî compared with having two matching QHD high-Hz displays?\n* How much would a double 4k setup (1@120+hz, 1@60hz) lag with multiple browser/notion/youtube tabs open?\n\nAnyone using a similar **RTX 4060 Laptop GPU** setup who can share what setup works best over HDMI + Thunderbolt?

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been rocking an Acer Predator Z35P for the past 8 years and I'm finally looking to upgrade to an HDR-enabled monitor. After extensive research, I've narrowed it down to the TCL 34R83Q for both programming and gaming (I'm avoiding OLED due to burn-in concerns).\n\nThat monitor launched around April 2024, so it's been out for 18 months, yet I cannot find any proper long-term reviews. TCL is also relatively unknown in monitors, which bothers me since I'm planning to keep this for 6+ years.\n\nSo I've got a few questions for actual owners:\n\n* Any issues after 6+ months of daily use? If so, have there been firmware updates from TCL to fix these?\n* I've read about flickering/blinkink/VRR troubles... is this Nvidia-specific or also AMD? I'll also be buying a new GPU, currently hesitating between 9070 XT or 5070 Ti.\n* G-Sync-compatibility: is this user-proof? I read about unreliability in one review, perhaps just an isolated case...\n* Are there any issues with blooming/uniformity or dead pixel after 1y+ usage?\n\nIt's currently at 699 EUR on amazon, which seems like good value, but only if it actually lasts. Any real-world experiences would be helpful.\n\nThanks!",

It literally has stick drift brand new and it‚Äôs also in the back instead of the bottom so it‚Äôs harder to reach.¬†\n\n# Monitor Build/looks:\n\nAgain the MSI wins hands down Looks better from the back, the chin doesn‚Äôt bother me. Creaking and build quality seems similar.\n\n# Accessories:\n\nThe MSI has white cables which is nice. I don‚Äôt really care but if you do it‚Äôs a nice add on. Although the MSI cables feel a little short. KTC are black and again fine. Both have the usb type b as the KVM but the msi has a slightly different shaped plug. Not sure what‚Äôs up with that. Ports are fine.¬†\n\n# Software:\n\nMSI wins in some areas and KTC in others. As I said before, it has better customization. It has more crosshairs and the crosshair changes color. You can also update the firmware so there is optimism if anything needs to be fixed and in my experience something does seriously need to get fixed. But I‚Äôll get to that later. You can customize which quick setting is set for each of the four directions. And dual mode is accessible with 2 button clicks. The MSI also has a desktop app so you can configure it there. Pretty nice.¬† The ktc is non customizable and dual mode has to be dug in the settings. BUT, you can actually control gamma, hue, and saturation on it. In case you need to make adjustments with that. It also has more HDR modes. I kept it on the Vesa one the whole time. Keep in mind the KTC likely will not have hardware updates. On their website it says firmware is final, so that‚Äôs a little concerning.¬†\n\n# Dual Monitor:\n\nWould not recommend the 1080 mode on either. It‚Äôs so blurry imo. I have 3 1080p 27 inch monitors for work and they are much clearer. I had to play some games with AA off to make it more bearable. Or maybe TAA and Non Integer scaling don‚Äôt work for me. Too fuzzy and made my eyes strain and my head hurt. You might be ok.¬†\n\n# Now the Good Stuff!\n\n# Response:\n\nIn SDR the input lag is imperceptible to me on both displays. And it seems in professional testing that it‚Äôs around 5 ms without Local Dimming so it‚Äôs not really an issue. Felt snappy and didn‚Äôt notice any issues at 4k 60hz or 4k 120HZ+.\n\nIn HDR, it was a little difficult. I feel like it was just barely close enough to not feel it. What I mean is, you get used to it so fast since it‚Äôs so small, if you can feel it. This is unlike frame gen which adds significant input lag and I can feel it every time. So, HDR or Local Dimming in SDR had no issues with input lag on both monitors. It felt fine to me running at mostly 120fps+ on the competitive games I played (The Finals, Arc Raiders Playtest, BF6). YMMV.\n\n# Brightness:\n\nIn SDR, the ktc gets significantly brighter. It easily outshines the MSI. The MSI by comparison looks a little bit dull. I find that confusing as it‚Äôs the same panel and it‚Äôs SDR, neither is hitting 1000+ nits. The MSI felt around 400 nits, the KTC felt maybe close to double which is crazy. They both get low enough to not have any issues in the dark.¬†\n\nIn HDR, I had weird issues. When running 2 monitors at HDR on windows, it seemed to prefer the MSI all the time. It worked well with auto HDR, and was brighter than the KTC consistently. Which made no sense as the KTC 100 percent is brighter on other platforms. Could be because I have an amd card or could just be KTC and windows. I tried HDMI, DP, different cables, different ports, and updated to 25H2 to see if it was fixed. YMMV.¬†\n\nIn Linux and on my Chromecast, the KTC gets what seems 30-50% brighter than the MSI consistently. The MSI is good, but the KTC actually blows you away a bit and easily destroys my LG CX.¬†\n\nReally only used Linux to A/B test with Windows for some of the issues I had. Didn‚Äôt play games since Linux HDR support is iffy.¬†\n\n# HDR Color:\n\nThis is the point where hopefully I don‚Äôt get called a hypocrite. If you look at my comment history I recommended the E16M consistently once I got it. But I was mistaken. At first when I received the MSI, I thought the KTC looked washed out and overbrightened. But really the MSI is saturated, unnaturally so.¬† Even when trying to dull everything down with HDR calibration and the ODS settings. The greens on the MSI look too green. The trees, grass, and plants are too vibrant. The reds are too red.¬† Dirt, house colors, the sun, even the color of an owl looks to yellowy/orange. Watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s), the sunsets look too deeply red. Not at all like real life. The houses at 13:43 don‚Äôt look a pale, sun beaten orange. It seems like somebody dropped a bit of highlighter red on them and they pop too much. At 5:31 the yellow line on the road looks too orangey-yellowish. I know what those lines look like in real life and they don‚Äôt look red shifted. Feels like I‚Äôm looking at a Samsung AMOLED from like 10 years ago with the vivid setting set to max. I tried everything, updated the firmware, calibrated, changed cables, changed OS‚Äôs, installed the msi driver, used the icc profile from msi, tried the desktop software to try and force the movie preset for more accuracy. I even changed the saturation and color on amd‚Äôs adrenalin. Nothing fixed it. It happens in both linux, windows, and my Chromecast so I know it‚Äôs the panel/firmware/calibration. It‚Äôs very unfortunate because once you catch it in a video or movie. It really irks you that the colors are unrealistic.\n\nFunnily it helps BF6 not look washed out, but it's not good for more regular naturally lit content.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the KTC destroys the MSI in colors, especially in HDR. Compared to my OLED TV and OLED iphone 16PM, the KTC is basically the same. The colors are accurate and realistic in HDR. And the brightness is freaking awesome. The problem is the KTC is not detected by auto HDR usually, and is very wonky with Windows. So it's hard to test video games that don't have native HDR. The MSI was consistently using auto HDR which was awesome for me since I don‚Äôt have an Nvidia gpu.¬†\n\nAlso, at really bright, white scenes, the MSI loses detail. On a scene with a white cat laying down on top of a white blanket, the MSI is just overblown white on the blanket, while KTC preserves detail and you can see the individual blanket strings and the reflections at the tips.¬†\n\n# SDR colors:\n\nIn SDR the panels are very close, although the MSI is slightly saturated still. But it would be passable. It seems they are suitable for professional work due to the clamping down. The sRGB modes looked identical to me.¬†\n\nNote: Don‚Äôt touch the ‚Äúpremium color‚Äù gaming option on the MSI at HDR. All the saturation gets even worse and looks horribly overcolored. in SDR, it's ok. Makes everything pop a lot.\n\n# HDR Contrast/Blooming:\n\nBlooming is handled better by the MSI. It‚Äôs not a stomping, but the MSI gets a bit darker and has a bit less blooming. This is probably related to the brightness with the KTC being brighter. Although blooming is still well controlled, just not as excellently as the MSI. It's actually difficult to notice blooming on the MSI sometimes. It‚Äôs there but you have to pay attention to it. Once you play or watch a video you‚Äôll never notice it again unless it's the youtube video menu's at the edge. I think since those are at the edge and because they cover so much they can be more noticeable. The KTC is close but you can see it a little easier. TBH, neither broke immersion or caused any issues. It‚Äôs just whether you want better contrast and less eye searing light scenes or slightly worse contrast but blinding bright snow scenes. Both do well. Although I have to say, the MSI only does this well on the highest LD setting, the other two settings still have that IPS glow. The KTC has 3 levels and all show what you expect of Mini-LED just at different aggressiveness with the brightness suffering at the highest level.\n\nNote: You can use LD in SDR content but you have to be comfortable with haloing and artifacting around text. Especially on grey backgrounds like youtube, steam, etc..¬†\n\n# Productivity:\n\nBoth are awesome for this. IPS at 4k 27 inch. Text is perfect and no eyestrain. Whites on the KTC are actually white though. The MSI are grayish white it seems again. I think my panel is borked. Or could be brightness issues again, but the MSI does not look white. Even after calibration and on full brightness\n\n# Issues:¬†\n\n**MSI:** Actually I would‚Äôve kept the MSI if color reproduction was good and whites we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ white. It worked every time with windows and auto HDR actually worked consistently. Never had issues with games or playing anything. The software is nice too along with the desktop app. It‚Äôs really just the color inaccuracy which is unacceptable. I think something was definitely wrong with it but not enough to not be sent out. Annoying.¬†\n\n**KTC:** It didn‚Äôt play that well with windows. HDR colors looked washed out on the desktop and auto HDR only turned on in a couple of games as opposed to MSI. If it was consistent, this is a killer panel and awesome monitor. The colors and brightness are exactly what you expect out of this type of tech. I‚Äôm kinda sad I couldn‚Äôt keep this one tbh‚Ä¶..\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAt the end of the day. Neither of the monitors worked out for me for different issues. The KSI has the better panel (or calibration), the MSI the better software. I think I‚Äôll be returning them both and going back to my dual 1440p fast IPS monitors. I can‚Äôt justify spending half a rack for something that doesn‚Äôt work right and waiting for hopefully some update that fixes it. I‚Äôll wait to see if things are ironed out and maybe try again at a later date. OLED is a no go for me since I do development work and supposed eye strain. I hope this helps and if you buy either, I hope you have no issues.¬†\n\nLet me know if you want to know anything else. I‚Äôll be returning them within the next week so I can answer any questions while they are on my desk. AND if you have any suggestions for solutions. I‚Äôm open to it!\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n\nEdit: you can actually customize the joystick quick settings on the KTC. So that‚Äôs nice. You can set the dual mode to either the left, right, or down. ",

Playing games is not the objective, instead support for hours doing programming, so text clarity and good colors in static screen is the idea.\n\nPlus could be eye-care protecion. \n\nI found these two:\n\nASUS ROG Strix 27‚Äù 4K HDR400 USB-C Gaming Monitor(XG27UCS)‚ÄìUHD (3840 x 2160), 160Hz, 1ms, Fast IPS,130% sRGB,Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync, G-Sync Compatible, DisplayWidget, Tripod socket. \n\nThis one costs 350 USD, seems good but I'm not sure if it is good for static screen usage, ie for office use.\n\nDell 27 Plus 4K Monitor - S2725QS - 27-inch 4K (3840 x 2160) 120Hz 16:9 Display, IPS Panel, AMD FreeSync Premium, sRGB 99%, Integrated Speakers, 1500:1 Contrast Ratio, Comfortview Plus - Ash White\n\nThis one costs 240 USD, seems to met my requirements, but the question is: are there any monitor like this with better specs below my budget ?\n\nFinally I'm aware that there are monitors for coding like BenQ but those are out of my budgets and have 60 Hz refresh rate.\n\nIf I said something wrong, or you are aware of some other monitor that could fit, or you have some advice for me, please let me know. Thanks you.\n\n ",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: just ranting over AOC being the type of guy who leaves you on delivered while they're online\n\nI bought a monitor from them during black Friday last year when I saw a nice OLED deal for 400$ (not including tax) for a PC build I was planning. Color saturation was a bit weird (especially for an OLED) no matter how much I tweak with the settings, but otherwise it served me well.\n\nAround August, 9 months after purchase, I noticed some weird glitching at the bottom of the panel. I thought it might be a problem with my PC, thought after days of troubleshooting, I realized the problem was with the monitor since using a different cable with a my old laptop still didn't solve the issue. I contacted AOC about this since then thought various methods, from their official website to their email but with no response, and the issue is only getting worse, because on late August black horizontal bars are all over the monitor and on September 16 the monitor started to black screens every 15 seconds or so for around 4 seconds.\n\nThe warranty I got is 4 years of no dead pixels, 4 years of advanced replacement and a year of free replacement for accidental damage, and with my luck so far I'm sure their gonna find something to get them to have it go under user-damage, and I only got 4 weeks until that expires.\n\n\nWhat hurts is that I spent a lot to ship this monitor to my region and that I sacrificed some of the GPU budget to squeeze in that OLED panel so I guess the moral of the story is don't ship monitors overseas and prioritize performance over display for gaming if you can't stretch your budget\n\n",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring.

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO JA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**‚Ç¨13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 ‚Ç¨/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of ‚Ç¨30 than one of ‚Ç¨100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶let's start with the **package content:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User manual\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the ‚Ç¨13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but‚Ä¶ the highs got easily out of control‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is‚Ä¶ somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child‚Äôs voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors‚Äô behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies‚Äô guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **‚Ç¨13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n¬†",

Yeah the highs are crisp, and I'll admit footsteps sound good, but I'm not getting the same emersive factor that I was getting from the nova pros. For example jumping out the plane in warzone the wind and engine sounded like it was actually up in your face if that makes sense, but with the Maxwells it just sounds thinned out. I have Atmos and the latest firmware installed and yes I tweaked with the EQ. Is there something I'm missing here?",

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick. But for $1000 you don't even get a charger, like how is a dude gonna charge the damn phone???",

Out of the box yes but with EQ bass shelf on 6xx it gets much closer. They complement them well. 6xx is more of an intimate sound, XV is more spacious.\n\nKick drums and high hat sound perfect IMO. Love it\n\nOne weird thing I noticed....I always run through freq sweeps and tone generators every once in awhile to make sure there is no driver buzzing or other weird stuff going on.\n\nWith these Edition XV, there is no driver buzzing. However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos? No. But now that I know it's there...\n\nI'll use for a couple weeks and see if it goes away.",

    "selftext": "I recently realized that most of my headphone stands put undue focused pressure on my headbands or compress the pads. I have seen some really nice stands on vids by Resolve (a Focal stand) and GadgetryTech (forget the brand), but those are $250-$500, more than I want to pay for a stand. I found these HiFi For All stands (pictured) which are affordable, and solve the problem, but I would prefer one with a bit of a longer headband area (vs just wide depth-wise). Like the ones on Gadgetry‚Äôs vids - there is one that has a little knob that looks like it is for length adjustment that looks nice too, but I can‚Äôt find it on the net. (Third picture, from his Aune AR5000 review, sorry for blurriness).\n\nI am thinking there must be some hidden gems out there that are reasonable affordable, and available in the US sans tariff/import fees, preferably.",

I never had a issue with the XS comfort either, but the Arya's feel so far more comfortable.\n\nThe sound is such an upgrade. Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger.

Maybe it‚Äôs different for you.\n\nEdit 2: I repositioned the headphone a bit backwards. Seems to help with the ear pain.

You can feel the wider sound stage or I should say the distance the pads created the second you put them on.\n\nLess bass but just right, stock bass was too much for me. Sub bass doesn‚Äôt seem to be impacted much.\n\nBetter mids IMO. more separation, details.\n\nTreble is definitely more, airy but not really harsh to me so far.\n\nFeels like the tuning is now neutral bright like IEMs but still has good amount of bass.

    "selftext": "**source:** tidal or personal flac files through bluetooth aptx\n\n**FIT:**\n\nHDB 630 - very comfortable but loosest of the bunch. felt a bit insecure. if l looked up or shook my head I had that feeling they may fall off. smaller ear cups too if you're concern about that and I could feel contact with my ears but nothing uncomfortable for me.\n\nPX7 S3 - slightly more clamping force which got a little uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. best seal out of the bunch so pick your poison.\n\nPx8 S2 - most comfortable. not too tight, not too loose. just right on my head. doesn't feel insecure.\n\n**BUILD QUALITY:**\n\nHDB 630 - decent. I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn‚Äôt that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don‚Äôt have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I‚Äôve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don‚Äôt I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars). Any other suggestions are welcome, looking for open backs with a big soundstage as well as a bass boost. Not too concerned with neutrality. ",

    "title": "Sennheiser HDB 630 - Maybe Buy 2 Headphones Instead",
    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Good sound, good customization, bad comfort, finnicky connectivity, high price. Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

Also, if anyone has experience with both these and the Epic Lab Edition TWS, how do they compare/how does the Jlab Signature sound profile for each compare? Thank you.\n\nI am someone who was originally aiming towards the Creative Aurvana Ace 3s, but love the sound profile of the Jlabs too much (I use the Knowles Sound Profile with a bump in the bass) and thought why not upgrade to the headphones instead of the TWS to compensate for the difference in soundstage and generational gap as the Epic Lab Edition TWS are a few years dated now compared to the Creatives.",

    "selftext": "Listening to them as I write this. Technically a fist impression but like I know what I'm listening for and done all my test songs so I feel confident on how I feel. They sound great, shocker right. The big thing is music just sounds correct in these. Good bass extension so still fun. Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow ‚Äî out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence ‚Äî it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they‚Äôre insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other ‚Äî everything has its space.\n\nHaven‚Äôt played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it‚Äôs nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony‚Äôs level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it‚Äôs impressive how well the ANC works ‚Äî definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn‚Äôt.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn‚Äôt quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it‚Äôs not far behind ‚Äî way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts ‚Äî 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I‚Äôd still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I‚Äôm really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic ‚Äî clean, balanced, natural ‚Äî and they‚Äôre super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic ‚Äî super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality‚Äôs surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

The mesh around it too get earwax on them, needing to clean them every few days.  \nIt's just become a regular routine for me to clean off my earwax atleast once a day to avoid getting my ears shut off due to the wax. Was not too confident with hydrogen peroxide, so got an ear camera cleaning tool by bebird, and honestly it is quite good to use.  \nThe scoop is silicone based so i dont feel much sceptical about it to not put in my ear... However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

Once I get that sorted, I will definitely measure them, but for now you are going to have to rely on my impressions.\n\nThe bass is not bad at all! It is tight, quick, and honestly fun. While it has a midbass peak somewhere, likely at 200hz which is common among closed backs, I very much do not dislike it! The midrange is a little forward, and the treble has some peaks that I am very certain is down to the resin chamber.\n\nThis is purely a for fun project, not final as I plan to do stamped metal as the actual chamber for my closed back. There is fog that generates inside the chambers which doesn't look pretty, but overall, I think looks very cool! Everything is hand assembled and designed by me.\n\nThe pads are Yaxi ST pads, the drivers are 40mm titanium speakers that I am currently working on with a manufacturer, and the resin chamber is made by facfox.",

    "selftext": "That cord always ends up tangled in my pocket, a tiny knot of chaos I have to spend minutes undoing. My clumsy fingers wrestle with the plastic wire, while people with wireless earbuds would‚Äôve already finished two songs by now. It‚Äôs been too long‚Äîits rubber coating has started to get sticky, the volume button on the controller feels jammed, and sometimes there‚Äôs a faint electric buzz in the right ear. Maybe it‚Äôs time to replace it.\n\nBut I just can‚Äôt quit that little click when I plug it into my phone.\nSo soft, yet so solid.\nLike the sound of an old door lock turning, shutting the whole world out.\n\nWalking is the worst. The wire swings across my chest, rustling against my jacket‚Äôs zipper. On the stairs I have to hold it tight, or it‚Äôll catch on the railing. Windy days are even worse‚Äîthe wire tangles in my hair and pulls hard enough to hurt. I still remember that rainy day when my best friend and I huddled under the convenience store awning. She naturally took off her right earbud and handed it to me:\n‚ÄúListen‚Äîthis intro is amazing.‚Äù\nA raindrop slid down the wire into my collar, cold and sharp. We stood together in that shared ninety centimeters of space, and the warmth of her body seemed to flow through the copper line. For a moment, the rain really did feel like decoration.\n\nNow my friend wears thousand-yuan noise-cancelling headphones, walking with confidence, never worrying about tangled cords. She says technology is great‚Äîit‚Äôs freed us from the wire.\nBut I‚Äôm still using this glitchy old pair, the left side fine, the right side buzzing now and then‚Äîonly working if I hold it at just the right angle. Like me, struggling in that night without an ending‚Äîbroken, stuttering, unclear.\n\nYesterday on my way to class, the wire snagged on my backpack strap again. I crouched to untie the knot while the person behind me clicked their tongue in annoyance. But honestly, I kind of enjoy this clumsiness. Wireless feels too perfect‚Äîperfect like a lie. The spotless charging case, the precise touch controls, never tangled, never messy. But my life is a tangle‚Äîwhy should my music be perfectly ordered?\n\nThis wired earphone has been with me for nearly three years. The braided cable is pilling, the gold plating on the plug worn thin. These flaws are like folded corners in an old diary, recording every ordinary day. Of course a new pair would be better‚Äîsleek and shiny‚Äîbut it doesn‚Äôt know my ears. It hasn‚Äôt heard the song I played on repeat after you left during that fight. It doesn‚Äôt know the white noise that lulled me to sleep on sleepless nights.\n\nLast month I almost replaced it. I even placed the order for the newest model‚Äîthen canceled it at 3 a.m. The customer service agent asked if there was a problem with the product.\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe problem‚Äôs with me.‚Äù\n‚ÄîNostalgia is a sickness with no cure.\n\nToday, as the taxi climbed the overpass, the right ear suddenly went silent. I instinctively twisted the yellowed plug, feeling the rough edge of the tape under my fingers. The river below flowed calmly, and in my left ear Eason Chan was singing:\n‚ÄòThe water knows well‚Äîit‚Äôs my duty to cherish the flowers.‚Äô\nThe music sounded thin, like a bird that had lost one wing.\nAnd still, I never replaced these earphones.\n\nThe right one is dead now. So be it. One side is enough.\nThis worn-out cord I clung to‚Äî\nin the end, it couldn‚Äôt keep the two worlds playing in sync.",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

    "title": "What's your perfect pair of headphones?",
    "selftext": "That's what I want to know. Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring. At that moment I realised that they are perfect for me.",

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO JA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**‚Ç¨13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 ‚Ç¨/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of ‚Ç¨30 than one of ‚Ç¨100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶let's start with the **package content:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User manual\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the ‚Ç¨13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but‚Ä¶ the highs got easily out of control‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is‚Ä¶ somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child‚Äôs voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors‚Äô behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies‚Äô guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **‚Ç¨13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n¬†",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

Love the flat bass response down to like 20hz, no roll off. I think the treble is perfect for me and I don‚Äôt think vocals are too far back in the mix at all.\n\nI‚Äôve had Sundara and Ananda in the past, as well as LCD 2C.\n\nWhile I never thought the Hifimans were overly piercing or too treble forward, I think the XV is definitely closer to the 2C in terms of overall tonality.\n\nWill definitely be keeping these.\n\nAre they better than 6xx? Out of the box yes but with EQ bass shelf on 6xx it gets much closer. They complement them well. 6xx is more of an intimate sound, XV is more spacious.\n\nKick drums and high hat sound perfect IMO. Love it\n\nOne weird thing I noticed....I always run through freq sweeps and tone generators every once in awhile to make sure there is no driver buzzing or other weird stuff going on.\n\nWith these Edition XV, there is no driver buzzing. However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos? No. But now that I know it's there...\n\nI'll use for a couple weeks and see if it goes away.",

Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them.

We live in a rural area and it‚Äôs two hours to the nearest so it‚Äôs a novel event and we wandered around checking out everything . Outside of some Bose about 15+ years ago, I‚Äôve never had occasion to be near NC Headphones. \n\nAnyway, I popped these on and EVERYTHING went dead silent. Best of all, my wife‚Äôs voice, right in front of my face trying to talk to me. Reminded me of that scene in, I think, Face Off with travolta and cage where someone drops headphones of soothing music on the little 4 yr old kid and then a huge gun battle breaks out. In that crazy, crowded, noisy store I heard nothing but soft cool jazz. I could see my wife‚Äôs lips moving but could hear a word and it was pure bliss. Not sure which model I had but they were like $500+ at the time. \n\nQ: Anything BETTER, or cheaper yet still super isolating and effective these days? How would I go about trying other models out? \n\nAlso appreciate advice on replacing ear pads, battery life, overall longevity of devices. ",

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick.

It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it‚Äôs tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For ‚Äúheavier‚Äù music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that‚Äôs clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It‚Äôs an excellent headphone and if you don‚Äôt AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man...

It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring.

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO KA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FiiO JA11.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**‚Ç¨13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 ‚Ç¨/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of ‚Ç¨30 than one of ‚Ç¨100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶let's start with the **package content:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User manual\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the ‚Ç¨13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but‚Ä¶ the highs got easily out of control‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is‚Ä¶ somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child‚Äôs voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors‚Äô behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies‚Äô guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **‚Ç¨13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n¬†",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

No. But now that I know it's there...\n\nI'll use for a couple weeks and see if it goes away.",

I never had a issue with the XS comfort either, but the Arya's feel so far more comfortable.\n\nThe sound is such an upgrade. Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger.

Easy - you don't need this.  \n  \nBut if the Deck is your ONLY PC?  You're gonna want to use this video.",

    "selftext": "Hello! I understand this is a very, VERY niche situation, but I believe it would be important to share, since there's very few articles about this out there.\n\nSo, I'm making this post as a warning and a guide for how to recover from a \"bricked\" system, after enrolling keys and enabling secure boot through sbctl in Arch Linux ( this locks you out of SteamOS, and any other OSes not signed by your secure boot keys :) )\n\nI just went through a roller coaster of emotions because I hadn't done enough research, went fiddling around with the system, and found out way too late that there's no way to disable secure boot in the SD's BIOS.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to remove the enrolled keys from the system, even if you didn't sign any files before rebooting (don't ask how I managed that):\n\n\nYou will need the following packages:\n\n- sbctl\n\n- efitools\n\n- mokutil\n\n\nIf no system files were signed:\n\n- Take the drive with your OS, and mount it to another computer;\n\n- Disable secure boot in the second device, and boot;\n\n- Sign the necessary files (using \"sudo sbctl verify\", then \"sudo sbctl sign -s <file>\").\n\n\nIf system files are signed:\n\n- Boot into your OS on your Steam Deck;\n\n- Find the \"PK.key\", \"KEK.key\" and \"db.key\" files that were created with \"sbctl create-keys\" (I used the command: sudo find / -type f -name \"*.key\");\n\n- Use the commands \"mokutil --pk\", \"mokutil --kek\" and \"mokutil --db\" to see the keys that are still enrolled into the system;\n\n- And the following commands to delete each key, one by one (you might have to run some of these multiple times, to account for the multiple keys):\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/PK.key PK\",\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/KEK.key KEK\", and\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/db.key db\"\n\nAfter there are no more keys showing up when the mokutil commands are ran, you should be able to use \"sbctl status\", and see that there are no \"vendor keys\"; Now you can reboot your system, and secure boot should be disabled! Yay!\n\nI combined these steps from these two great guides, thank you very much to the authors:\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Assisted_process_with_sbctl\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SecureBootForSteamDeck",

    "selftext": "I have had my Steam Deck OLED for several weeks now, and have made a bunch of changes to it like a 2TB SSD and hall effect sticks and what not. I even built a headless server (Ryzen 7 5800XT, RX 9060 XT 16GB) running Windows 11 specifically for streaming my Windows-only titles (like Battlefield 6) to my Deck. For a while I was just using Steam Remote Play (with all the settings configured according to other threads for the most reliable performance), but frequent gamescope crashes/freezes led me to try Sunshine/Moonlight. Lately I have been using this (along with MoonDeck and MoonDeck Buddy) and have had good results, **when it works**.\n\nFor additional context, I have a pretty high-end home networking setup consisting of all Ubiquiti hardware, and very dense AP coverage (I have a lot of ESP-based IoT devices on a separate SSID). I have a 2.5Gb symmetrical fiber ISP (irrelevant to local streaming but figured I would mention), UCG Fiber gateway/NVR, USW Pro XG 8 PoE 10Gb core switch, USW Flex 2.5g PoE secondary switch, two U7 Pro XGS APs, two U7 In-Wall APs, one U6+ AP and some other PoE switches, etc. etc. The streaming server is on GbE, and I have a highly configured wireless environment with fine-tuned radio transmit power on each AP, minimum RSSI set, etc.\n\nAll that to say, my home network is NOT the issue here, and I have narrowed it down to the WiFi chipset on the Deck being the problem. I have read about these issues and try pretty much every fix there is, but there are just constant issues with the WiFi - dropped packets, disconnects, weird power state issues (even after disabling WiFi power management in the developer settings), and overall just an unplayable streaming experience once the issues start. Sometimes it works without issue, even for several hours, sometimes I cannot even get into a match before it starts stuttering or something crashes. It even frequently causes driver hangs on the host machine because of the connection issues on the Deck.\n\nConversely, using the Moonlight client on my Mac mini (on a 10GbE wired connection), the stream is flawless and rock solid stable even on the longest streaming sessions.\n\nI am wondering if there is any workaround to the frankly unacceptable WiFi issues? Is there a hardware mod to replace the chipset with something better? Third party kernel with different WiFi drivers (or different drivers in general)? Does the SteamOS beta channel have different drivers that solve all these problems? Also, I have tried forcing the WPA supplicant backend, but this just breaks streaming altogether (black screen and choppy audio, Remote Play just flat out refuses to start), so I wasn't able to test stability with the different backend.\n\nI know Valve is 'aware' of the issue, but given that the OLED has been out this long and there still isn't an official fix, I'm at the point of going really far into a rabbit hole to fix it myself. Wondering if anyone in the SD community has come up with a solution.",

    "selftext": "I am trying to play multiple games with friends, like Palworld, Don't Starve Together and the like, but I cannot do it with my Steam Deck plugged into a monitor with a keyboard and mouse. Instead of defaulting to Keyboard and Mouse controls, games will keep the Controller UI, and in some cases, will entirely bar me from certain functions (i.e. riding a mount in Palworld) as there is simply no input to do it. This is not a consistent problem, as games like Abiotic Factor are able to be played just fine with keyboard and mouse, but certain games don't have the built-in functions to receive keyboard and mouse inputs instead of Steam Deck inputs. I've looked all over online and have found no real way to fix this, even trying to boot up games with various versions of Proton. I am losing my mind, and am begging for some way to be able to either \"trick\" my games into thinking a computer is running them, or anything else that might work. Thank you. ",

While this works near perfectly in desktop mode, keeping largely to 30/60 of the four hours I've tried it, Game Mode seems to override this switch. Causing the problem most people experience where the game dips into the 40s instead with plenty of slowdown. I'm not sure how to fix this.\n\nthat's all I've got right now.",

Last week ive started experiencing a problem where my screen is choppy, has lines and randomly black screens upon being docked and running on my monitor for a few seconds over and over again. Ive tried using developer options to change the channel to main to fix, no dice, ive gone into the konsole and reset some resolution properties, nada, changed monitors, changed to a tv, unplugged everything and nothing seems to work. IT did randomly decide to work for a couple minutes after sitting for a while but then I dropped my controller and it unplugged and it proceeded to cause all of the issues all over again. Im guessing it has to do with my dock because there are no problems at all in handheld mode. If anyone has any experience with these kinds of issues and has a fix so that I dont have to go as far as laying down on the road outside, that would be appreciated. \n\nUpdate: it is now even worse as I cannot even get the buggy twitchy screen to show up and now I only have black screen when docked.",

    "title": "How Best To Play Metroid & Castlevania Classics?",
    "selftext": "So I've been playing metroidvanias pretty much nonstop since I got back into them a couple years ago. I've realized that I'm woefully inexperienced on the \"classics\" of the genre; namely, Metroid and Castlevania games. I've only played one of each: Metroid Dread and Castlevania: SotN.\n\nAfter doing some research I've narrowed down my list of games I \"aught\" to play down to 5 from each series (actually, 5 +3 for Castlevania, since it was unclear the quality of those last 3). I'll post the games list at the end. Given the wide swath of consoles these games come from (SNES, GBA, GC, 3DS, DS, PS1, TG16), my question is: what is the best way to play them?\n\nI've also noticed the huge spike in retro handhelds being advertised on social media that come with emulators and tons of games preinstalled. I'm not opposed to buying a device dedicated for this, just for the pure simplicity of just buying it and I'm ready to play. There are a lot out there now. Is there one that you guys think would be best suited for my needs? Is there a 3rd party that sells a version of it with these games on it?\n\nI also have a Switch and Steam Deck. I'm not opposed to buying the games for the switch, though I don't really use it much anymore. The Steam Deck seems like the best solution since (1) I assume it's the most powerful of the three options and (2) I regularly use it for my other portable gaming. Would it be really painful to get all these games working well on the SD? I'm not opposed to putting in the work, but I can see myself spending tons of time getting everything set up, only so not every actually play the, (Skyrim modding anyone). I started looking into it and the sheer number of emulators and options and such seemed a bit... daunting.\n\nTLDR; What's the best way to play the older Metroid and Castlevania games these days?\n\n¬†\n\nSuper Metroid (Super Nintendo, 1994)\n\nMetroid: Fusion (GBA, 2002)\n\nMetroid: Zero Mission (GBA, 2004)\n\nMetroid Prime (GameCube, 2002)\n\nMetroid: Samus Returns (3DS, 2017)\n\nSuper Castlevania IV (SNES, 1992)\n\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night (PS1, 1997)\n\nCastlevania: Aria of Sorrow (GBA, 2003)\n\nCastlevania: Dawn of Sorrow (DS, 2005)\n\nCastlevania: Order of Ecclesia (DS, 2009)\n\n  \n\\-----Castlevania Maybes-----\n\nCastlevania: Rondo of Blood (TG16, 1993)\n\nCastlevania: Circle of the Moon (GBA, 2001)\n\nCastlevania: Portrait of Ruin (DS, 2006)",

    "selftext": "Usually, when I think of a 4X game, I imagine a big screen with Steam opened, keyboard & mouse, and a comfy gamer seat (or back pain if you play for too long!).\n\nBut we‚Äôre currently working on ***A Planet of Mine: MasterMine Edition***, a 4X that is cute, cozy, AND designed for handheld console.\n\n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3391740/A\\_Planet\\_of\\_Mine\\_MasterMine\\_Edition/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3391740/A_Planet_of_Mine_MasterMine_Edition/)\n\nReleasing our demo at Steam Next Fest (the demo is still available) allowed us to understand that our game is more Steamdeck than PC oriented. A lot of PC players are used to play without a gamepad and we didn‚Äôt fully realize that.\n\nWe‚Äôre currently working on keyboard & mouse controls, and it works fine. So you can still play our upcoming game on PC, but it would feel way better on Steamdeck:\n\n* Controls are tailored to play smoothly on a pad and to make full use of all the Steamdeck buttons,\n* UI is designed to be readable on a small screen,\n* There‚Äôs a quick game mode, you decide how long you want it to be,\n* If you feel peaceful, you can be friends with other factions,\n* You can do some actions, then pause the game and continue later,\n* Characters are so cute that you want to keep them in your pocket üíô\n\nThe game is perfect to be played on-the-go.  \nWe hope Steamdeck users will enjoy our alien game üòÖ\n\nNB: Sorry the poor video and sound quality!",

    "selftext": "Hello! I understand this is a very, VERY niche situation, but I believe it would be important to share, since there's very few articles about this out there.\n\nSo, I'm making this post as a warning and a guide for how to recover from a \"bricked\" system, after enrolling keys and enabling secure boot through sbctl in Arch Linux ( this locks you out of SteamOS, and any other OSes not signed by your secure boot keys :) )\n\nI just went through a roller coaster of emotions because I hadn't done enough research, went fiddling around with the system, and found out way too late that there's no way to disable secure boot in the SD's BIOS.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to remove the enrolled keys from the system, even if you didn't sign any files before rebooting (don't ask how I managed that):\n\n\nYou will need the following packages:\n\n- sbctl\n\n- efitools\n\n- mokutil\n\n\nIf no system files were signed:\n\n- Take the drive with your OS, and mount it to another computer;\n\n- Disable secure boot in the second device, and boot;\n\n- Sign the necessary files (using \"sudo sbctl verify\", then \"sudo sbctl sign -s <file>\").\n\n\nIf system files are signed:\n\n- Boot into your OS on your Steam Deck;\n\n- Find the \"PK.key\", \"KEK.key\" and \"db.key\" files that were created with \"sbctl create-keys\" (I used the command: sudo find / -type f -name \"*.key\");\n\n- Use the commands \"mokutil --pk\", \"mokutil --kek\" and \"mokutil --db\" to see the keys that are still enrolled into the system;\n\n- And the following commands to delete each key, one by one (you might have to run some of these multiple times, to account for the multiple keys):\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/PK.key PK\",\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/KEK.key KEK\", and\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/db.key db\"\n\nAfter there are no more keys showing up when the mokutil commands are ran, you should be able to use \"sbctl status\", and see that there are no \"vendor keys\"; Now you can reboot your system, and secure boot should be disabled! Yay!\n\nI combined these steps from these two great guides, thank you very much to the authors:\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Assisted_process_with_sbctl\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SecureBootForSteamDeck",

The kit came with all of the screws bunched together, which made it difficult to figure out which went where. This took up at least half an hour of my time and I feel like it would be so easy to add that to there guild. Along with this, I actually broke a couple of posts while installing the hardware. While this isn't a huge deal and, from I hear its common, I feel like this happens because the whole kit can fit so tightly together that at times you need to use force to get some of the pieces in place \n\nOver all though im satisfied with the end result but I dont think i can recommend this, especially for a beginner",

    "selftext": "I am trying to play multiple games with friends, like Palworld, Don't Starve Together and the like, but I cannot do it with my Steam Deck plugged into a monitor with a keyboard and mouse. Instead of defaulting to Keyboard and Mouse controls, games will keep the Controller UI, and in some cases, will entirely bar me from certain functions (i.e. riding a mount in Palworld) as there is simply no input to do it. This is not a consistent problem, as games like Abiotic Factor are able to be played just fine with keyboard and mouse, but certain games don't have the built-in functions to receive keyboard and mouse inputs instead of Steam Deck inputs. I've looked all over online and have found no real way to fix this, even trying to boot up games with various versions of Proton. I am losing my mind, and am begging for some way to be able to either \"trick\" my games into thinking a computer is running them, or anything else that might work. Thank you. ",

So you can still play our upcoming game on PC, but it would feel way better on Steamdeck:\n\n* Controls are tailored to play smoothly on a pad and to make full use of all the Steamdeck buttons,\n* UI is designed to be readable on a small screen,\n* There‚Äôs a quick game mode, you decide how long you want it to be,\n* If you feel peaceful, you can be friends with other factions,\n* You can do some actions, then pause the game and continue later,\n* Characters are so cute that you want to keep them in your pocket üíô\n\nThe game is perfect to be played on-the-go.  \nWe hope Steamdeck users will enjoy our alien game üòÖ\n\nNB: Sorry the poor video and sound quality!",

    "selftext": "Hello! I understand this is a very, VERY niche situation, but I believe it would be important to share, since there's very few articles about this out there.\n\nSo, I'm making this post as a warning and a guide for how to recover from a \"bricked\" system, after enrolling keys and enabling secure boot through sbctl in Arch Linux ( this locks you out of SteamOS, and any other OSes not signed by your secure boot keys :) )\n\nI just went through a roller coaster of emotions because I hadn't done enough research, went fiddling around with the system, and found out way too late that there's no way to disable secure boot in the SD's BIOS.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to remove the enrolled keys from the system, even if you didn't sign any files before rebooting (don't ask how I managed that):\n\n\nYou will need the following packages:\n\n- sbctl\n\n- efitools\n\n- mokutil\n\n\nIf no system files were signed:\n\n- Take the drive with your OS, and mount it to another computer;\n\n- Disable secure boot in the second device, and boot;\n\n- Sign the necessary files (using \"sudo sbctl verify\", then \"sudo sbctl sign -s <file>\").\n\n\nIf system files are signed:\n\n- Boot into your OS on your Steam Deck;\n\n- Find the \"PK.key\", \"KEK.key\" and \"db.key\" files that were created with \"sbctl create-keys\" (I used the command: sudo find / -type f -name \"*.key\");\n\n- Use the commands \"mokutil --pk\", \"mokutil --kek\" and \"mokutil --db\" to see the keys that are still enrolled into the system;\n\n- And the following commands to delete each key, one by one (you might have to run some of these multiple times, to account for the multiple keys):\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/PK.key PK\",\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/KEK.key KEK\", and\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/db.key db\"\n\nAfter there are no more keys showing up when the mokutil commands are ran, you should be able to use \"sbctl status\", and see that there are no \"vendor keys\"; Now you can reboot your system, and secure boot should be disabled! Yay!\n\nI combined these steps from these two great guides, thank you very much to the authors:\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Assisted_process_with_sbctl\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SecureBootForSteamDeck",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "title": "Smart Curtain Motor help? Motor specs or modificaitons for 16/2 Low-Voltage Power cable?",
    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.

As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob ü§∑\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on¬†https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5.

    "title": "Reverse-engineering DPS 101 on LEDVANCE Tuya RGBIC lamp - unknown LED indices cause device reboot",
    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0‚Äì360, S and V are 0‚Äì1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01‚Ä¶81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests ‚Äúindex‚Äù is the zero-based LED position inside the device‚Äôs internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` ‚Üí hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 ‚Ä¶` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the ‚Äúapply‚Äù byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 ‚Ä¶`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n‚Ä¢ Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n‚Ä¢ Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n‚Ä¢ Working zone writes: `‚Ä¶ 81 01` to `‚Ä¶ 81 04`  \n‚Ä¢ Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n‚Ä¢ Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n‚Ä¢ Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

For example, I‚Äôd like Alexa to turn on other plugs or play music whenever the decoration is activated.\n\nLink: https://www.mainliningchristmas.com/2015/12/toy-review-northpole-treeluminator.html?m=1\n\nSo I am thinking if I could have a smart plug, and plug the other plug into it, maybe the smart plug can pick up when that electrical wattage or whatever changes, and the trigger a routine.\n\nOr is there something I can plug into the hallmark plug‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm open to ideas\n\nMy setup:\n\t‚Ä¢\tAll my current smart plugs are older Tuya plugs and already connected to Alexa.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI exclusively use Alexa routines for automation.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm open to using SmartThings or another hub if it gives clear steps and doesn‚Äôt require wiring.\n\nI saw Smart Things has an energy consumption feature but not sure if it would work for immediate things like this.. and requires a subscription to play with it\n\nHas anyone successfully done something like this? Any advice for a tiny smart plug or sensor that can detect when a device powers up and trigger Alexa routines would be amazing!",

My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I‚Äôve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send ‚Äújammed‚Äù alerts\n\nHere‚Äôs what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it‚Äôs happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%¬± after 90 days. The Thread one‚Äôs down to about 60 %. I‚Äôm guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock‚Äôs spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA‚Äôs network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA‚Äôs core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA‚Äôs event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the ‚Äúold‚Äù one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it‚Äôs been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).",

What if someone hacks the cameral, etc.\n\nI initially thought it was a joke, but I found the product on the Kohler site ([Dekoda - Tracker & Waste Analyzer](https://www.kohlerhealth.com/dekoda/)) and apparently this is a serious piece of equipment; it's not cheap either at $600.\n\nI love home automation with my full Ubiquiti setup including cameras, WiFi switches, outlets, locks, etc., but I don't think I am ready to install a \"poo cam\".",

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "Hi all\n\nKind of an odd post for this thread but I own a commercial bakery and I have a need for an air pressure sensor. Basically if we have negative air pressure in the room I risk burning up my oven control units very quickly. As you can imagine this is expensive both to repair and both in time. Air pressure can be controlled with the facilitation of a make up air system and multiple exhaust fans that can be individually switched on and off. \n\nIdeally I‚Äôd have sensor that goes off and sounds an audible alarm if say there is too much negative air pressure so that the bakers can adjust things.\n\nDoes something like this exist ready to go out of the box?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob ü§∑\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on¬†https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

Is Alexa a good choice for simple automation setups?\n\nWhich protocol would you recommend ‚Äî Matter, Zigbee?\n\nAny recommendations for socket relays and motion/presence sensors that work well with Alexa?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips or personal experiences!",

It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "title": "Been testing Bringnox smart shades with HomeKit for 3 weeks ‚Äî here‚Äôs what I learned",
    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I‚Äôve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox ‚Äî mostly because it supports Matter and doesn‚Äôt need a separate hub.\n\nHere‚Äôs my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn‚Äôt connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz ‚Äî after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It‚Äôs surprisingly consistent ‚Äî every morning when I‚Äôm still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a ‚ÄúMovie mode‚Äù scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they‚Äôre showing around 85%. I‚Äôll update if that changes, but it looks like they‚Äôll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly ‚Äî not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went ‚Äúno response‚Äù üòÖ.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding ‚Äî but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt‚Äôs not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected ‚Äî thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn‚Äôt super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn‚Äôt bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that‚Äôs fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything ‚Äî I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn‚Äôt drop connection every other day.\nIf you‚Äôre building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I‚Äôll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5.

(Should not be too complicated to set up)\n-Do i still need a KNX Server like Gira/Jung?\n-Things like the Shelly displays dont work over BUS-System, just WIFI, right?\n\n\nSo i just would like a solution where everything will be  handled via HA in later future (when i had the time to set all up)\n\nBUT i also would like to have a simple and stable \"ready for basics\" main system.

And I have a few google things. \nIn all I have 3 Google home minis and 2 Google streamers all of which I will move away from as needed. The house has 3 Clipsal Wiser cameras that use Zigbee and a few light switches that are probably clipsal and use zigbee as well. (Clipsal Wiser is an Australian brand using Schneider Electric). I also have 3 Sonos speakers of unknown age that I have been unable to connect to a Sonos app. I want a few more things like a doorbell with camera and some door sensors. \n\nHubs seem to vary in price but there seem to be lots of recommendations here for Home Assistant and the price seems good. I‚Äôve seen a Home Assistant Green. Then it seems I need a dongle that is either zigbee or matter (if I want to add products that use matter ) or both. \n\nIf I understand this:\nI buy the hub\nplug it into my router \nplug the appropriate dongle into the hub\ndownload the app and connect it to the hub\nadd all my smart things through the app\nset up automations\nAdd more smart things - is there a limit?\n\nPlease tell me if I‚Äôm going wrong.

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

    "title": "Are Amazon Echo (3rd + 4th gen, speakers only) + Spotify integration hopelessly broken?",
    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/4NlGFmc\n\n_FWIW, I've disconnected and reconnected my Spotify account via the Amazon Echo / Alexa app many times, this type of thing keeps happening or never goes away_\n\nI have roughly six Amazon Echo speakers in my house. I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

Any suggestions?\n\nI‚Äôve read quite a few reviews saying Aqara can be hit-or-miss in smart setups (lag, stability, hub quirks). I‚Äôm open to solid alternatives available in Europe (EU versions).

    "selftext": "I have a large system that is a collection random smarthome products. I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I‚Äôve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox ‚Äî mostly because it supports Matter and doesn‚Äôt need a separate hub.\n\nHere‚Äôs my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn‚Äôt connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz ‚Äî after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It‚Äôs surprisingly consistent ‚Äî every morning when I‚Äôm still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a ‚ÄúMovie mode‚Äù scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they‚Äôre showing around 85%. I‚Äôll update if that changes, but it looks like they‚Äôll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly ‚Äî not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went ‚Äúno response‚Äù üòÖ.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding ‚Äî but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt‚Äôs not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected ‚Äî thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn‚Äôt super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn‚Äôt bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that‚Äôs fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything ‚Äî I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn‚Äôt drop connection every other day.\nIf you‚Äôre building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I‚Äôll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Right now, I have to turn it by hand every time, but I‚Äôd love to find a way to automate this process.\n\nIdeally, I need something easy to set up that can make the knob turn one notch to the right, or one (at most two) to the left, to bring it back to zero. I don‚Äôt need full remote control, just a simple solution that can handle this small motion‚Äîso I can avoid having to do it manually each time.\n\nHas anybody tried something similar or have any tips or suggestions for a device or hack I could use? Any help would be really appreciated.",

Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud.

Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

It‚Äôs made me realize how much control I could have outside Google‚Äôs ecosystem.\n\nSo, my question:\nWhat‚Äôs the best way to move away from Google/Nest entirely while keeping similar functionality (especially for cameras and hubs)?\n\nIs there a good local/NAS-based alternative for video storage and smart home integration?\n\nAnyone here migrated from Nest to Home Assistant-compatible cameras successfully?\n\nAnd what‚Äôs the best use for the Nest Hubs if I start de-Googling everything?\n\n\nAppreciate any tips or migration stories from folks who‚Äôve done this , I‚Äôm happy to tinker, but I don‚Äôt want to lose reliability or ease of use for the family.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I‚Äôve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox ‚Äî mostly because it supports Matter and doesn‚Äôt need a separate hub.\n\nHere‚Äôs my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn‚Äôt connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz ‚Äî after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It‚Äôs surprisingly consistent ‚Äî every morning when I‚Äôm still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a ‚ÄúMovie mode‚Äù scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they‚Äôre showing around 85%. I‚Äôll update if that changes, but it looks like they‚Äôll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly ‚Äî not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went ‚Äúno response‚Äù üòÖ.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding ‚Äî but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt‚Äôs not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected ‚Äî thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn‚Äôt super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn‚Äôt bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that‚Äôs fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything ‚Äî I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn‚Äôt drop connection every other day.\nIf you‚Äôre building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I‚Äôll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

    "selftext": "# üëã Howdy folks,\n\nI‚Äôm dealing with the SUPERFUN CPU throttling issue with my Dell 7490.\n\nI had it configured ‚Äî or some update years ago FINALLY fixed it ‚Äî and then maybe reset it six months or a year later.\n\nI‚Äôve basically been dealing with this crap for the last year or so and just ignored it ‚Äî but I‚Äôd like to fix this laptop again so I‚Äôm NOT wanting a new one for Black Friday.\n\n# ‚ö° The Issue\n\nWhenever my Dell Latitude 7490 (i7-8650U) is unplugged, the CPU instantly drops to UNDER 0.5 GHz or so and stays there no matter what power plan or Windows setting I use.\n\nPlug it back in and it jumps right back to 3.0+ GHz turbo, runs perfect.\n\nBasically, it‚Äôs unusable on battery ‚Äî I can‚Äôt even open Chrome without it crawling or other things eventually slowing down.\n\n# üîç What I‚Äôve Verified / Tried\n\n‚úÖ¬†**Battery Health:**¬†Excellent (OEM Dell battery detected, ‚ÄúAdaptive‚Äù mode, LG manufacturer)  \n‚úÖ¬†**Windows Power Plan:**¬†Min/Max CPU = 100 %, Cooling Policy = Active  \n‚úÖ¬†**Dell Power Manager:**¬†Set to¬†*Ultra Performance*  \n‚úÖ¬†**ThrottleStop:**¬†Works fine while plugged in, but the moment I uncheck¬†**BD PROCHOT**¬†on battery, laptop¬†**restarts within \\~10 seconds**  \n‚ö†Ô∏è¬†**Behavior:**¬†As soon as I unplug,¬†**BD PROCHOT lights constantly red**¬†in ThrottleStop and CPU locks to around¬†**0.5 GHz**\n\n# What It Looks Like Is Happening\n\nSo it‚Äôs looking like, from what I can see, that it‚Äôs due to¬†**Dell‚Äôs Embedded Controller (EC)**‚Ä¶\n\nEverything points to Dell‚Äôs¬†**Embedded Controller (EC) firmware**¬†forcibly asserting¬†**BD PROCHOT**¬†whenever the system runs on battery.\n\nIt‚Äôs¬†**not a normal thermal throttle**¬†‚Äî it‚Äôs a¬†**firmware current-limit trigger**¬†that Dell uses to protect the battery/VRM from high draw.\n\nWhen I try to override BD PROCHOT, the¬†**EC forces a system reset.**\n\nSo this seems to be¬†**hardware/firmware-enforced**, not a Windows or driver issue.\n\n# ü§¨ My Frustration\n\nHas¬†**ANYONE**¬†solved for how to fix this?\n\nIt‚Äôs so¬†**INFURIATING**¬†to have a laptop that‚Ä¶ basically needs to be plugged in in order to work like it‚Äôs in the¬†**21st century**¬†üôÑ\n\n# ‚ùì Specifically Looking For:\n\nüîπ Any¬†**EC firmware mod or BIOS version**¬†that removes BD PROCHOT enforcement?  \nüîπ Any way to¬†**intercept or spoof the EC‚Äôs BD PROCHOT line**¬†safely?  \nüîπ Any¬†**ThrottleStop or registry-level workaround**¬†that prevents the EC from re-asserting it?\n\nI‚Äôm¬†**not looking for**¬†‚Äúuse it plugged in‚Äù or ‚Äúbuy a new laptop‚Äù ‚Äî that defeats the point of having a laptop in the first place.\n\nI‚Äôm fine with performance¬†**not as high on battery**, but¬†**jesus**, not¬†*56k CPU-level processing.*\n\n# üôè Anyone got anything?",

So I did a fresh install of W11 with a USB. I disconnected my secondary SSD before resetting windows as someone convinced me that that's a good idea. W11 started up smoothly but when I tried to connect my secondary SSD, the PC still won't boot.\n\nThe boot order in BIOS seems fine  \nBIOS does not even detect my secondary SSD when it is connected.  \nI have tested the SATA ports, cables and power cables and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them. I switched the cables my secondary SSD were using and connected them to the Windows SSD and the PC booted up smoothly.\n\nI suspects it's the secondary SSD that's causing the problem and not Windows or something else.\n\nWhat to do next?\n\nThanks.",

    "selftext": "For a few weeks now ive been struggling with the audio on my laptop. Ive tried basically everything to fix it but literally nothing works. Ive reinstalled the audio driver 5 billion times, restarted my laptop a bunch, tried troubleshooting, etc. When i troubleshoot it gives me varied results. Sometimes it detects that the drivers are outdated so it offers to update them. When i have it update it itll say the drivers are updated and that the \"absolute volume settings\" have been restored but nothing changes. Other times itll just say the absolute volume thing or itll say theres no issue at all. Ive tried going in the device manager to restart or update the drivers myself but every time i check for updates it says its up to date. The laptop itself will allow me to raise and lower the volume as if audios playing but nothing actually comes out, even with the volume to 100. Ive tried testing if the speakers themselves were just messed up by doing a discord stream on one account and then watching it on another but on the stream theres 0 audio coming from my laptop. My mic works fine though. The only time audios worked has been when id connect them to my bluetooth headphones. Now when i try to use the headphones they no longer work though. Like, no audio plays still. \n\n  \nIts been like this for weeks and i have literally no clue what to do. Ive only had this laptop for about a year and havent had any issues with it until the audio started messing up. Please GODD if anyone knows whats wrong or has any solutions PLEASE lmk ",

    "selftext": "Hello, everyone. I hope you're all doing great. If anyone could please help out with this, I would be so immensely grateful.\n\nI've been the owner of an Acer laptop for the last few years, and it came with the previous Windows. For the whole time I owned it in the previous version of Windows, there were no issues whatsoever with the integrated or dedicated graphics. Integrated is simply an Intel UHD, Dedicated is a 1650 max q.\n\nSince previous version hit its end of life, I felt urged to upgrade Windows to 11, which I did once it was offered to me via Windows Update. It mostly went off without a hitch and everything transferred over well.\n\nHowever, now after some days of usage, a very concerning problem has arisen. At one point my screen briefly turned black and the audio lagged before restoring to normal, and checking Reliability Monitor reveals a problem labeled a 'Hardware error' from Windows. Checking the technical details reveals the following.\n\n>Problem Event Name:\tLiveKernelEvent\n\n>Code:\t141\n\n>Parameter 1:\tffffb80c5b3e6050\n\n>Parameter 2:\tfffff8042053a9d0\n\n>Parameter 3:\t0\n\n>Parameter 4:\tffffb80c542df080\n\n>OS version:\t10\\_0\\_26200\n\n>Service Pack:\t0\\_0\n\n>Product:\t768\\_1\n\n>OS Version:\t10.0.26200.2.0.0.768.101\n\n>Locale ID:\t1033\n\nChecking Event Viewer doesn't reveal any error messages directly by comparison, but 'Livekernelevent 141' type notifications appear semi-frequently in the info logs for Windows.\n\nI have tried updating the Intel graphics drivers, uninstalling and reinstalling, running system checks like /scannow and the DISM one, the problem seems to persist if I try to benchmark/stress test the integrated GPU.\n\nAny further hints or clues as to what can be done would be much appreciated. Reliablity Monitor can also give me a temporary copy of related files such as a dump file if that helps anyone. Thank you all so much for your time, God bless, and have a great day.",

Like, I have two screens, 1080p@60hz and when I am playing some YouTube full hd video in a windowed mode, it stutters like crazy.\n\nThings that I tried to resolve this issue:\n\n* I tried updating basically all drivers on my Dell, including both BIOS drivers and integrated GPU drivers\n* set the thunderbolt setting in my laptop bios to no authorization\n* restarted the dock couple of times or unplugged it to try to pair again\n\nBut none of these helped, the screens are not recognized at all. Also note:\n\n* I am using the original cable from the dock, it is connected to my Thunderbolt port on my dell\n* Windows are up to date\n\nAny ideas are welcomed. If I wont be able to resolve this issue in a day or two, I will just return the dock, because this is not worth the headaches.",

    "title": "Random stand-by's while running the desktop computer.",
    "selftext": "Right. Let's get the most obvious outta the way:\n\n1. Model: ASUS GL12CP NR069T\n2. OS: Windows 11 Home\n3. Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz\n4. BIOS-version: American Megatrends Inc. GL12CP.314, 16-10-2020\n5. (RAM): 32,0 GB\n6. GPU: Nvidia RTX 5060.\n7. PSU: Argus Intel ATX 12v 2.31. 720W.\n\nI guess that's that. If there's anything else, feel free to ask. Anyways, the short version is that I've been getting random stand-by's on my desktop after switching the GPU, PSU and RAM blocks. They are all brand spanking new and I would say I checked as well as I could beforehand, and all the drivers, components etc. should be compatible and in theory be able to run without a hitch... except they kinda don't. All drivers also are as new as they come, so... yeah.\n\nMy computer quite simply goes to stand-by, while I'm doing random stuff. I wish I could say there's a pattern to it, but it'll just go to stand-by while I'm looking at a random, low-effort page in a browser, while I can run through rather demanding games for hours at a time without a hitch. In comparison, I've had a 6 or so hour stint in WoW during rush hour. No problems what so ever. And at another time the system has a seizure, because I opened a web page... a page I opened plenty of times before without it causing any kind of stand-by, by the way. There is no real pattern, and it happens where there is no particular load or stress to the system that I can see. Task Manager gives me no real indicator of anything big going on, unless I'm trying to run demanding tasks on purpose, and even then that's no guarantee of a stand-by. Actually, I'll say far from it.\n\nI just don't get it. I tried various diagnostics, fiddling with the BIOS settings (someone online tried recommending to see if there is an option in the BIOS settings disabling any forced stand-by (not that I could find any), tried limiting the CPU to 99% max, disabling any stand-by option in the power settings, unseating the hardware and reinserting it again... and so on and so forth. I've been unable to come to any kind of solution, where I even feel I'm on the right track to solving it. CPU isn't overheating or anything as well, so that bit doesn't seem to be the fault as well. The PSU should also be above specs for the GPU and the overall system demands, even during peak performance, so that should be covered. At least that's what I've been told. 720W should cover it.\n\nHell, the last time I tried combing through the BIOS settings just to look, I had roughly 3 minutes to study, and... the damn thing went to stand-by. I tried doing a memory diagnostic, and once it got to 20%... stand-by. At one point I had to restart twice before even getting past the pin code login, because the second I entered my pin and logged into Windows... yeah, you get the idea. On the third restart, I got to the desktop and it was business as usual, as if nothing was essentially wrong.\n\nAnd you'd think the system logs gives an idea about what causes it. You would get some kind of event with an error code, but that stuff is just as inconsistent. The last two stand-by shutdowns produced exactly ZERO lines with any indication that the computer even WENT to stand-by. Before that, I got an error in the log about the network the moment it went to stand-by, but I've gotten that error code before, where it didn't shut down. \n\nI just don't get it. My theory (flawed, maybe) is that if something is essentially wrong, I would get shanked during peak loads or far more regularly, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I can get 2 stand-by events in 2 minutes and then go 24 hours (or whatever) while wildly abusing system ressources with, say, gaming without any problems before the next event.\n\nI don't even know where to start, and the web is a massive font of options that'll have me testing non-stop until March, where pretty much all of those options have massive disclaimers about the likelyhood of success attached.\n\n... help?",

    "selftext": "Hello\n\nQuick Disclaimer: My first language isn't english so I probably will do some errors in my writing, also I tried to solve the problem via AI and got some helpful advices but none of them really solved my problem.\n\nA month ago I noticed that my Browser (OperaGX) was heavily lagging after like 20min. Mostly UI things like Volume Controls on YouTube, Twitch but also things like clicking on a Twitter post to read the replies. All the hovering effects are heavily delayed and I couldn't use the Browser properly mostly. I wanted to switch browsers a while ago and I switched to Vivaldi. I thought my problem would be solved but I quickly realized that it didn't. I did many tests with AI and I noticed that I dont encounter lagging when using Firefox, a non chromium Browser. Everytime I found out something new I told the AI to get some suggestions. I prompted to give me a summary of all the things we tried. It didn't put all of their suggestions in it but the most important ones.  \nI would really appreciate it if someone reads it and really tries to help me.  \nI will try to gladly reply to all your questions for further information\n\nAI Summary:\n\n**System:**\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 3600\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 2070\n* **RAM:** 16GB 2133MHz\n* **OS:** Windows 11\n* **Browser(s) tested:** Opera GX, Vivaldi (Chromium-based), Firefox\n* **Typical apps running:** Browser, Discord, Minecraft, Twitch/YouTube/Twitter\n\n**Main Problem:**\n\n* **Chromium-based browsers become slow and laggy after a few minutes of use.**\n* UI interactions delay noticeably:\n   * Hovering UI elements (e.g., Twitter tweets, Twitch UI, YouTube volume control)\n   * Clicking elements\n   * Scrolling feels delayed\n* Initially smooth **after browser restart**, then consistently degrades over time.\n* **Firefox does not have the issue at all.** Only Chromium browsers are affected.\n\n# Troubleshooting Steps Already Performed (with Results)\n\n# 1. Hardware Acceleration\n\n* **Turned off** ‚Üí Browser performance became **much worse**\n* **Re-enabled** ‚Üí Returned to original issue (lag after a few minutes)\n\n# 2. Updated GPU Drivers\n\n* NVIDIA drivers updated to latest version\n* **No improvement**\n\n# 3. Changed Chromium ANGLE Graphics Backend\n\n* Switched from **Default** to **OpenGL** ‚Üí **UI improved for ChatGPT**, but lag continued elsewhere\n* Later switched to **D3D11** ‚Üí **No significant improvement**\n\n# 4. Discord / Overlay / Game Interaction\n\n* **Discord overlay disabled**\n* **Minecraft closed while testing**\n* **Issue still occurs without games open** ‚Üí Not caused by overlays or game hooks\n\n# 5. Checked chrome://gpu rendering state\n\n* Hardware acceleration active:\n   * **WebGL/WebGL2:** Hardware accelerated\n   * **Compositing:** Hardware accelerated\n   * **Video decode/encode:** Hardware accelerated\n* **Rasterization Disabled** (Chrome reports driver blocklist condition) ‚Üí No clear improvement after any state changes\n\n# 6. GPU Shader Cache Reset\n\n* Deleted:\n   * GPUCache\n   * ShaderCache\n   * GrShaderCache\n   * DawnCache\n* **No noticeable change**\n\n# 7. CPU Load and Clocks Observed\n\n* Average CPU temperature \\~ **54¬∞C**\n* **Effective clock sometimes very low (1000‚Äì2000MHz)** even during UI lag\n* Ryzen power plan already set to **AMD High Performance**\n* Reinstalled **AMD Chipset Drivers** ‚Üí Power plans refreshed ‚Üí **No change**\n\n# 8. Adjusted Ryzen Power Limits (PPT/TDC/EDC) in BIOS\n\n* Values changed and tested\n* **No change in browser behavior**\n\n# 9. Disabled Low-Power States\n\n* **C-States disabled in BIOS**\n* **No improvement** (hover/UI lag remains)\n\n# 10. Tested Chromium Without GPU Process\n\n* Forced Chromium to run **without GPU acceleration**\n* Result: lag **same as before** (or worse) ‚Üí Root cause likely **not GPU rendering performance itself**\n\n# 11. Checked VRR / G-SYNC / V-Sync\n\n* Disabled:\n   * G-SYNC/FreeSync/VRR\n   * NVIDIA V-Sync (global off)\n* **No improvement**\n\n# 12. Disabled Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS)\n\n* Restarted PC\n* **No improvement**\n\n# 13. Disabled MPO (Multiplane Overlay) in Windows Registry\n\n* Restarted PC\n* **No improvement**\n\n# üß≠ Key Observations\n\n|Browser|Behavior|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Vivaldi / Chrome / Opera GX**|Input latency increases after a few minutes; hover delay; UI sluggishness|\n|**Firefox**|Runs smoothly with no lag under identical conditions|\n\nThis strongly suggests an **interaction issue between Windows desktop composition, Chromium GPU/CPU thread scheduling, and the system environment.**  \nHowever, all common causes (HAGS, MPO, VRR, overlays, power states) were eliminated.\n\n# üí¨ Current Status\n\nThe issue **still persists.**  \nIt is **not affected** by:\n\n* GPU acceleration on/off\n* Game overlays\n* Power states\n* VRR / V-Sync\n* Browser GPU backend selection\n* GPU driver updates\n* Chromium shader cache\n* Running or not running Minecraft\n* Running or not running Discord\n\nThe **only consistent differentiator** so far is:\n\nFirefox is running smoothly, Chromium Based browser aren't",

They are all connected via a standard WiFi router, and they are all running Windows 11. PC 0 has a USB-C 2TB external SSD, and of course its own built-in SSD as well.\n\nI'd like to turn PC 0 into a dedicated file server, with a nightly backup from PCs 1, 2, and 3 saved on its local SSD. Then, I'd like for the connected external SSD to be a password-protected backup of PC 0, with overwrite abilities turned off. Simply put: if a user on PC 2 saves a file, I want it to go to the local machine, to PC 0, and to the external SSD. But if that user deletes the file from PC 2, I only want it to delete from PC 0, not the SSD. (Same with file revisions: backup most recent to PC 0, save ALL revisions to the external SSD.) Bonus points if I can dictate what is backed up based not just on directory, but by file extension as well (e.g. don't backup .mp4 files).\n\nFurther, I'd like for PC 0 to be remotely accessible (maybe all of the PCs, really) from outside the local network.\n\nIdeally this would be accomplished with minimal upfront costs, $0 monthly fees, and without changing the OS.\n\nThanks for your help everyone!",

    "selftext": "So my rog 3 keeps restarting every 5 mins idk why, there was a history of it before, around december, this rog phone 3 was just a hand down to me by my brother, and its main problem was it kept restarting, and it will show a \"Qualcomm CrashDump Mode\" in the screen. Didnt know what was the problem, so i asked a phone technician if what was the problem, and they said it was the Cpu of the phone. Had no money that time to get it fixed so just gave up trying to get it fixed.\n\nFast forward to around June this year, tried to find some solutions to how to fix it, then i tried to update the firmware? Or the system thing itself, so i did. After that, i (somehow) fixed the restarting issue, then used it like a normal phone afterwards and playing some heavy games like Genshin Impact, Mobile Legends, Zenless Zone Zero, etc. . But then, around this time (my timezone) Oct 26, 2025 maybe at afternoon, was just scrolling through tiktok, then suddenly my phone restarted somehow. Thought it was a one time only, and thought it was alright, so did my usual thing to do, played some Genshin,  but then later on, hopped on tiktok again, and it happened again, then again, and again, and again, then i noticed, it was the same problem that happened earlier this year, but there was no \"Qualcomm CrashDump Mode\" popping after restarting, was just like a normal restart of phone. I noticed also it was the same duration of 5 mins after my phone starts, before it restarts again. \n\n\nPlease help me with this, can you guys figure out whats the main cause of it? But based on my researches before, my guess is that my cpu needs to be fixed.\nA problem i noticed before when was playing, sometimes i get massive frane drops from 120 fps to prob 30-40? Or some stuff like that\n\nIm not sure if i asked the right subreddit about this, but i think i did? Since its a problem with my phones software/hardware, if you guys know some subreddits i can ask about this problem, please lmk, thanks.\n\nTil now, my phone keeps restarting over and over again, please help me with this. Thank you",

    "selftext": "Im flairing this as a hardware issue because this issue is before my computer is actually on, but I'm not entirely sure. My specs are:\n\n3060 Ti  \nI7-14700k  \n2x 16gb 7200mhz RAM sticks (toned down in bios)  \nROG Strix Z-790H  \n850w power supply\n\nThe issue started when I came home one day to go on my computer and it just wouldn't turn on. So first, I flipped the power switch off and on, this didn't work. Then, I unplugged the PSU cord from the computer and plugged it back in, then turned the power switch on. This didnt work. At a loss, I just unplugged everything from the wall (monitor and PSU cord) and plugged it back in, then turned the power switch back on. This worked. Then, my computer functions as normal. Now, in order to turn on my computer, every time I have to replicate this. Switch off the power, unplug the cords from the wall, then plug them back in, and turn on the power. This morning I tried just unplugging from the wall and it didnt work. I have to exactly switch off power, unplug from the wall, plug back in, then switch power back on, and it'll work.\n\nMy computer so far functions as normal otherwise. If it's important, LEDs on my motherboard that are unrelated to the computer itself being turned on will still be on, so I suppose that means the PSU is still supplying power to some extent. I'm not quite sure how to resolve this, if I have to get a new PSU, or just deal with a complicated method of turning on my computer every morning.",

For about 5-20 seconds, our devices stop receiving internet which happens countless times a day.  \nIt's strange though as our computers will drop out but our phones will work just fine and vice versa. It's also odd that when on calls that require internet, the person on the other end of the line can hear us but we can't hear them.  \n  \nSome examples of what's happening are the following:  \nWatching videos on any app, the video just abruptly stops.  \n  \nI play video games and chat with my mates on discord. When the internet drops out while I'm gaming with mates it sometimes either drops out for the game only and not discord as I can still hear and talk with friends, or only discord drops out as I can keep playing the game. When the latter happens, my friends can still hear me but I can't hear them.   \nAlso when the internet drops for the game, it still receives my inputs.  \n  \nThis can get especially frustrating when I'm in a zoom meeting for work or uni.   \n  \nI've had this problem for probably over a year now and was wondering if anyone knew what the problem is, or even better have a fix for it.\n\nThank you!!!",

    "selftext": "I live with two people. Me and the other person can be home all day with no issues, and then as soon as our roommate gets home and starts using the internet, it goes out. It works again after we reset it, but it usually happens a couple times as long as she's using it. And it's not that our wi-fi is getting overloaded or anything because whenever our roommate is home alone it still goes out on her. It goes out without fail literally every single time she uses her laptop. I think it's only when she uses her laptop, not her phone. And today she told me that her work wi-fi has been having issues but her coworkers say it doesn't happen when she is off. She's had two different laptop since we moved in and it happens with both of them.\n\nI know it sounds crazy but what could possibly be the explanation here?\n\n  \nETA: we don't honestly have too many devices plugged into wi-fi at once. Just our three laptops, phones, and a Roku. We use Wow internet with Download Speed: 600 Mbps, Upload Speed: 50 Mbps. ",

So I did a fresh install of W11 with a USB. I disconnected my secondary SSD before resetting windows as someone convinced me that that's a good idea. W11 started up smoothly but when I tried to connect my secondary SSD, the PC still won't boot.\n\nThe boot order in BIOS seems fine  \nBIOS does not even detect my secondary SSD when it is connected.  \nI have tested the SATA ports, cables and power cables and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them. I switched the cables my secondary SSD were using and connected them to the Windows SSD and the PC booted up smoothly.\n\nI suspects it's the secondary SSD that's causing the problem and not Windows or something else.\n\nWhat to do next?\n\nThanks.",

    "selftext": "For a few weeks now ive been struggling with the audio on my laptop. Ive tried basically everything to fix it but literally nothing works. Ive reinstalled the audio driver 5 billion times, restarted my laptop a bunch, tried troubleshooting, etc. When i troubleshoot it gives me varied results. Sometimes it detects that the drivers are outdated so it offers to update them. When i have it update it itll say the drivers are updated and that the \"absolute volume settings\" have been restored but nothing changes. Other times itll just say the absolute volume thing or itll say theres no issue at all. Ive tried going in the device manager to restart or update the drivers myself but every time i check for updates it says its up to date. The laptop itself will allow me to raise and lower the volume as if audios playing but nothing actually comes out, even with the volume to 100. Ive tried testing if the speakers themselves were just messed up by doing a discord stream on one account and then watching it on another but on the stream theres 0 audio coming from my laptop. My mic works fine though. The only time audios worked has been when id connect them to my bluetooth headphones. Now when i try to use the headphones they no longer work though. Like, no audio plays still. \n\n  \nIts been like this for weeks and i have literally no clue what to do. Ive only had this laptop for about a year and havent had any issues with it until the audio started messing up. Please GODD if anyone knows whats wrong or has any solutions PLEASE lmk ",

    "selftext": "Hello, everyone. I hope you're all doing great. If anyone could please help out with this, I would be so immensely grateful.\n\nI've been the owner of an Acer laptop for the last few years, and it came with the previous Windows. For the whole time I owned it in the previous version of Windows, there were no issues whatsoever with the integrated or dedicated graphics. Integrated is simply an Intel UHD, Dedicated is a 1650 max q.\n\nSince previous version hit its end of life, I felt urged to upgrade Windows to 11, which I did once it was offered to me via Windows Update. It mostly went off without a hitch and everything transferred over well.\n\nHowever, now after some days of usage, a very concerning problem has arisen. At one point my screen briefly turned black and the audio lagged before restoring to normal, and checking Reliability Monitor reveals a problem labeled a 'Hardware error' from Windows. Checking the technical details reveals the following.\n\n>Problem Event Name:\tLiveKernelEvent\n\n>Code:\t141\n\n>Parameter 1:\tffffb80c5b3e6050\n\n>Parameter 2:\tfffff8042053a9d0\n\n>Parameter 3:\t0\n\n>Parameter 4:\tffffb80c542df080\n\n>OS version:\t10\\_0\\_26200\n\n>Service Pack:\t0\\_0\n\n>Product:\t768\\_1\n\n>OS Version:\t10.0.26200.2.0.0.768.101\n\n>Locale ID:\t1033\n\nChecking Event Viewer doesn't reveal any error messages directly by comparison, but 'Livekernelevent 141' type notifications appear semi-frequently in the info logs for Windows.\n\nI have tried updating the Intel graphics drivers, uninstalling and reinstalling, running system checks like /scannow and the DISM one, the problem seems to persist if I try to benchmark/stress test the integrated GPU.\n\nAny further hints or clues as to what can be done would be much appreciated. Reliablity Monitor can also give me a temporary copy of related files such as a dump file if that helps anyone. Thank you all so much for your time, God bless, and have a great day.",

    "selftext": "# üëã Howdy folks,\n\nI‚Äôm dealing with the SUPERFUN CPU throttling issue with my Dell 7490.\n\nI had it configured ‚Äî or some update years ago FINALLY fixed it ‚Äî and then maybe reset it six months or a year later.\n\nI‚Äôve basically been dealing with this crap for the last year or so and just ignored it ‚Äî but I‚Äôd like to fix this laptop again so I‚Äôm NOT wanting a new one for Black Friday.\n\n# ‚ö° The Issue\n\nWhenever my Dell Latitude 7490 (i7-8650U) is unplugged, the CPU instantly drops to UNDER 0.5 GHz or so and stays there no matter what power plan or Windows setting I use.\n\nPlug it back in and it jumps right back to 3.0+ GHz turbo, runs perfect.\n\nBasically, it‚Äôs unusable on battery ‚Äî I can‚Äôt even open Chrome without it crawling or other things eventually slowing down.\n\n# üîç What I‚Äôve Verified / Tried\n\n‚úÖ¬†**Battery Health:**¬†Excellent (OEM Dell battery detected, ‚ÄúAdaptive‚Äù mode, LG manufacturer)  \n‚úÖ¬†**Windows Power Plan:**¬†Min/Max CPU = 100 %, Cooling Policy = Active  \n‚úÖ¬†**Dell Power Manager:**¬†Set to¬†*Ultra Performance*  \n‚úÖ¬†**ThrottleStop:**¬†Works fine while plugged in, but the moment I uncheck¬†**BD PROCHOT**¬†on battery, laptop¬†**restarts within \\~10 seconds**  \n‚ö†Ô∏è¬†**Behavior:**¬†As soon as I unplug,¬†**BD PROCHOT lights constantly red**¬†in ThrottleStop and CPU locks to around¬†**0.5 GHz**\n\n# What It Looks Like Is Happening\n\nSo it‚Äôs looking like, from what I can see, that it‚Äôs due to¬†**Dell‚Äôs Embedded Controller (EC)**‚Ä¶\n\nEverything points to Dell‚Äôs¬†**Embedded Controller (EC) firmware**¬†forcibly asserting¬†**BD PROCHOT**¬†whenever the system runs on battery.\n\nIt‚Äôs¬†**not a normal thermal throttle**¬†‚Äî it‚Äôs a¬†**firmware current-limit trigger**¬†that Dell uses to protect the battery/VRM from high draw.\n\nWhen I try to override BD PROCHOT, the¬†**EC forces a system reset.**\n\nSo this seems to be¬†**hardware/firmware-enforced**, not a Windows or driver issue.\n\n# ü§¨ My Frustration\n\nHas¬†**ANYONE**¬†solved for how to fix this?\n\nIt‚Äôs so¬†**INFURIATING**¬†to have a laptop that‚Ä¶ basically needs to be plugged in in order to work like it‚Äôs in the¬†**21st century**¬†üôÑ\n\n# ‚ùì Specifically Looking For:\n\nüîπ Any¬†**EC firmware mod or BIOS version**¬†that removes BD PROCHOT enforcement?  \nüîπ Any way to¬†**intercept or spoof the EC‚Äôs BD PROCHOT line**¬†safely?  \nüîπ Any¬†**ThrottleStop or registry-level workaround**¬†that prevents the EC from re-asserting it?\n\nI‚Äôm¬†**not looking for**¬†‚Äúuse it plugged in‚Äù or ‚Äúbuy a new laptop‚Äù ‚Äî that defeats the point of having a laptop in the first place.\n\nI‚Äôm fine with performance¬†**not as high on battery**, but¬†**jesus**, not¬†*56k CPU-level processing.*\n\n# üôè Anyone got anything?",

    "selftext": "I recently updated my PC to to W11 from the cloud but after some time my PC wouldn't boot and kept loading with the motherboard logo showing. So I did a fresh install of W11 with a USB. I disconnected my secondary SSD before resetting windows as someone convinced me that that's a good idea. W11 started up smoothly but when I tried to connect my secondary SSD, the PC still won't boot.\n\nThe boot order in BIOS seems fine  \nBIOS does not even detect my secondary SSD when it is connected.  \nI have tested the SATA ports, cables and power cables and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them. I switched the cables my secondary SSD were using and connected them to the Windows SSD and the PC booted up smoothly.\n\nI suspects it's the secondary SSD that's causing the problem and not Windows or something else.\n\nWhat to do next?\n\nThanks.",

    "selftext": "For a few weeks now ive been struggling with the audio on my laptop. Ive tried basically everything to fix it but literally nothing works. Ive reinstalled the audio driver 5 billion times, restarted my laptop a bunch, tried troubleshooting, etc. When i troubleshoot it gives me varied results. Sometimes it detects that the drivers are outdated so it offers to update them. When i have it update it itll say the drivers are updated and that the \"absolute volume settings\" have been restored but nothing changes. Other times itll just say the absolute volume thing or itll say theres no issue at all. Ive tried going in the device manager to restart or update the drivers myself but every time i check for updates it says its up to date. The laptop itself will allow me to raise and lower the volume as if audios playing but nothing actually comes out, even with the volume to 100. Ive tried testing if the speakers themselves were just messed up by doing a discord stream on one account and then watching it on another but on the stream theres 0 audio coming from my laptop. My mic works fine though. The only time audios worked has been when id connect them to my bluetooth headphones. Now when i try to use the headphones they no longer work though. Like, no audio plays still. \n\n  \nIts been like this for weeks and i have literally no clue what to do. Ive only had this laptop for about a year and havent had any issues with it until the audio started messing up. Please GODD if anyone knows whats wrong or has any solutions PLEASE lmk ",

    "selftext": "Hello, everyone. I hope you're all doing great. If anyone could please help out with this, I would be so immensely grateful.\n\nI've been the owner of an Acer laptop for the last few years, and it came with the previous Windows. For the whole time I owned it in the previous version of Windows, there were no issues whatsoever with the integrated or dedicated graphics. Integrated is simply an Intel UHD, Dedicated is a 1650 max q.\n\nSince previous version hit its end of life, I felt urged to upgrade Windows to 11, which I did once it was offered to me via Windows Update. It mostly went off without a hitch and everything transferred over well.\n\nHowever, now after some days of usage, a very concerning problem has arisen. At one point my screen briefly turned black and the audio lagged before restoring to normal, and checking Reliability Monitor reveals a problem labeled a 'Hardware error' from Windows. Checking the technical details reveals the following.\n\n>Problem Event Name:\tLiveKernelEvent\n\n>Code:\t141\n\n>Parameter 1:\tffffb80c5b3e6050\n\n>Parameter 2:\tfffff8042053a9d0\n\n>Parameter 3:\t0\n\n>Parameter 4:\tffffb80c542df080\n\n>OS version:\t10\\_0\\_26200\n\n>Service Pack:\t0\\_0\n\n>Product:\t768\\_1\n\n>OS Version:\t10.0.26200.2.0.0.768.101\n\n>Locale ID:\t1033\n\nChecking Event Viewer doesn't reveal any error messages directly by comparison, but 'Livekernelevent 141' type notifications appear semi-frequently in the info logs for Windows.\n\nI have tried updating the Intel graphics drivers, uninstalling and reinstalling, running system checks like /scannow and the DISM one, the problem seems to persist if I try to benchmark/stress test the integrated GPU.\n\nAny further hints or clues as to what can be done would be much appreciated. Reliablity Monitor can also give me a temporary copy of related files such as a dump file if that helps anyone. Thank you all so much for your time, God bless, and have a great day.",
