    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAbout two months ago I released a major update to my weather app [Sonuby Weather](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1560347507?pt=122856099&ct=r_apple_october_2025&mt=8), which some of you might remember from my [Promo Sunday post last December](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hjwv12/i_built_a_fully_customizable_forecast_app_for/).\n\nThe latest update features the first truly configurable weather widgets for iOS, letting you build your personal forecast dashboard right on your home screen.\n\n**Here's what makes them special:**\n\n* **3 widget types** \\- Now & Next Hours (up to 42h on iPad), Next Days (up to 12 days), and Now & Next Hours Extended for twice the variables\n* **9 specialized reports** \\- Choose between Daily Life, Health, Snow Sports, Surfing, Photography, Hiking, and more - each showing relevant variables for that activity\n* **Truly customizable** \\- Don't like the default layout? Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "iPhone & Wi-Fi 7",
    "selftext": "> For those unaware, Apple claims that the iPhone 16 and 17 series support 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), but in practice this is **highly limited** compared with the full standard.  \n>  \n> **Wi-Fi 7‚Äôs most important technical features include:**  \n>  \n> ‚Ä¢ **Up to 240 MHz channel width on the 5 GHz band**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **Up to 320 MHz channel width on the 6 GHz band**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **4096-QAM modulation**  \n> ‚Ä¢ **MLMR MLO (Multi-Link Multi-Radio)** capable of aggregating multiple Wi-Fi bands into one high-throughput pipeline  \n>  \n> While Apple meets the *minimum certification requirement* (MLSR MLO), it disables nearly all optional features that make Wi-Fi 7 truly high-performance. As a result, **iPhone 16 and 17 models perform at speeds comparable to Wi-Fi 6/6E**, while other flagship phones achieve **3‚Äì4√ó higher throughput** using the optional features Apple ignored for two generations.  \n>  \n> For context, Wi-Fi 6/6E tops out at **160 MHz-wide channels**, **1024-QAM modulation**, and only one Wi-Fi band at a time ‚Äî yielding peak theoretical speeds around **2402 Mbps**.  \n>  \n> Wi-Fi 7, when fully implemented, doubles channel width to 320 MHz, quadruples QAM density to 4096, and enables **true multi-band operation via MLO**, dramatically increasing real-world throughput.  \n>  \n> Apple‚Äôs iPhones, however, still restrict channels to 160 MHz, leave QAM at 1024, and only use MLO as a basic failover mechanism ‚Äî effectively **Wi-Fi 6/6E with rudimentary band steering**.  \n>  \n> Some argue that wider channels, higher QAM, or MLMR MLO would drain battery. While Apple may have designed these limits intentionally, other flagship phones fully enable these features **without widespread battery complaints**, showing it‚Äôs a feasible design choice.  \n>  \n> Others claim that 5 GHz doesn‚Äôt support 240 MHz channels ‚Äî but in regions like the **United States**, access points can operate at 240 MHz on 5 GHz, and Apple‚Äôs iPhones simply don‚Äôt take advantage of it.  \n>  \n> Apple‚Äôs documentation confirms that the Broadcom chip in the iPhone 16 series and the N1 chip in the iPhone 17 series are **capped to a single 160 MHz band**. Meanwhile, users have observed the performance discrepancy across multiple forums and reviews:  \n>  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Jason Deegan review](https://jasondeegan.com/iphone-16-review-disappointment-with-wifi-7-performance/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Apple forum complaints](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255812908?sortBy=rank)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [MacRumors forum complaints](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-wifi7-router.2438418/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [Apple's official tech specs of 16 & 17 series](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/wi-fi-ethernet-specifications-apple-devices-dep268652e6c/web)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [TP-Link Community complaints](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/705570)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube comparison of the 16 series](https://youtu.be/07FRuS67iD8)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube comparison of the 17 series](https://youtu.be/VtimPHdiv7U)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [YouTube warning not to buy Wi-Fi 7 routers](https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc3dAEoPPFo)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [MacRumors article](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [5GStore analysis](https://5gstore.com/blog/2025/09/16/apple-n1-chip-wifi-7-iphone-17/#what-wccftech-found-apples-n-1-chip-its-limitation)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [PhoneArena article](https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-prevented-from-reaching-full-wi-fi-7-potential_id163151)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [iThinkDiff article](https://www.ithinkdiff.com/apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-7-limit/)  \n> ‚Ä¢ [iPhoneWired article](https://iphonewired.com/news/857921/)  \n>  \n> In conclusion, many users invest in premium iPhones and Wi-Fi 7 equipment expecting the full benefits of the standard.

    "title": "The iPhone Upgrade Program is absolutely NOT compatible with AppleCare One",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR: DO NOT try and add your iPhone Upgrade Program iPhone to AppleCare One, unless you want significant problems down the road.**\n\nI added my 16 Pro to AppleCare One in July, a few days after the program started. The support specialist read me boilerplate along the lines of \"In order to remain enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, you must immediately add your phone to AppleCare One to ensure no gap in coverage\". I did that, got a gift card back for \\~$120, and felt happy with myself.\n\nI successfully used the program to get a 17 Pro a few weeks ago, which I picked up in store. However, when I came to return the 16 Pro, the phone was marked as \"Enrolled in iPhone Upgrade Program\", but the option to close the loan was greyed out with \"loan details not found\". The store associates, up to and including supervisors were very confused by this and hadn't seen it before.\n\nAfter approximately **11 hours** on the phone with Citizens, and Apple Support, speaking with about 15 different people, all of whom were very friendly, but none of whom had any idea what had happened, and **3 visits** to the store, I was eventually advised to return the phone as a standalone trade-in, and receive a store gift card. I then had to call a special escalated support number and have them cancel the gift card and close the loan. (It still ended with a 4¬¢ balance, which I then had to pay Citizens by credit card üòÖ)\n\nI eventually had final confirmation from that escalated support line that, despite what AppleCare specialists tell you, and despite the boilerplate coverage language, cancelling the Theft and Loss protection to put your phone into AppleCare One **immediately** cancels the Upgrade Program eligibility. Obviously some systems are aware of this (allowing me to upgrade to 17 Pro), and some are not (preventing me from returning 16 Pro).\n\nI asked about the 17 Pro and confirmed that it too had been removed from the program. They advised me to do a Closed Box return in store and then immediately re-buy the same phone through the program to get it back into eligibility. I tried this, and while I passed the credit check and managed to keep my same phone, Verizon refused to activate the line (presumably because it was already connected - to me). As a result, I couldn't complete the transaction, and ended up having to re-buy my phone outright.\n\nTo Apple's credit, they recognized what a clusterfuck this was, and gave me a credit of $250, which I used for some AirPods Pro 3, and the guy in-store also gave me an Ultra Watch band for free. I also ended up with a negative loan balance of $260, which I got back as a check, and when you add back the $120 gift card back from July, I ended up doing ok. \n\nBut, it was an incredible time and energy suck and I did have to drop $1400 all in one go. I am lucky that I could just do that otherwise I would have left the store without my phone and then who knows what would have happened. I do not recommend this adventure to anyone. \n\nHopefully by the time the next phones are released there will be a proper integrated upgrade path, but for now, if you want to preserve your sanity, just stick with Theft and Loss coverage.\n\n ",

Why at least not make it a little bigger on a redesign or something to compete? I like USB-C, but I was always curious why Apple never continued to innovate a good port and cash cow.",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "title": "Reps ‚Äì I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you‚Äôre interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

With the screen starting to pop out of the frame, I thought I would make the jump too. \n\nFrankly - I am ***amazed***. Yes, it has its caveats - the camera is fine. The single speaker isn't as powerful. The screen time is not as long lasting as the old phone. But, for my use it is **simply perfect**. I can point and take photos without any extra features. I can barely feel it in my hand or pocket compared to the toe-crusher my 13PM was. I can make it through a light use day with juice to spare - or simply connect it at work. It is snappy, responsive and is sexy in black with no case. \n\nIn summary, I think it is a perfect phone for those of us who need a phone for the **basics**. Yes, for a power user you will have drawbacks, but if like me you treat your phone as an accessory rather than an extension of your body - make the jump. You too will be amazed I think :) ",

In the meantime, I need a new music player since it's basically useless with background play disabled.\n\nSo far, I've tried VLC player and Foobar 2000, but I've found both of them lacking. It's very difficult to customize the upcoming tracks. A \"play next\" and \"play last\" option would be really all I need. I mentioned Musicbee in the title because I really like it for how it functions, the UI and the fact it's free, but unfortunately the only ios app they have is some kind of remote that I don't see the point of.\n\nI'd like an app with those three same attributes, but I could justify spending some money if necessary. I haven't had much luck browsing through the app store since every other app has either ads, a subscription model or both, which I can't justify.",

I‚Äôve been an iPhone user since the original was released in 2007, typically upgrading every 1-2 years, and I‚Äôve never had second thoughts about a purchase. However, the battery life on the air is just not enough for me. \n\nI‚Äôm typically taking the phone off charger around 6am, and while sometimes I have some juice left when I go to bed around 11pm or so, many times it‚Äôs on low battery mode, or I have to top it off. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a power user, but I use my phone consistently throughout the day. The battery is at 100% capacity, and it‚Äôs struggling to keep up with my needs. It‚Äôs hard to imagine what it would be like at 90% capacity. \n\nWhen I couple the battery issues with the camera deficiencies and the single speaker, I‚Äôm left regretting my purchase. I do make calls on speaker sometimes, and the single speaker can make it hard to hear the person on the other end. I do like the form factor, and that is why I gave it a shot, but to have dramatically better battery/camera/speaker for only $100 more with the pro, I will be returning my air and purchasing the pro. I will miss having a lighter phone, but the tradeoffs on performance are simply not worth it. ",

I drooped from the bed so phone got cracked. Thankfully, I have Samsung care plus with my phone so I call to how to deal with it. They ask me to go to serfity store related Samsung so they will fix it. Before I go over there, of course I called my situation, my model and color. The employee said \"Yes we can fix it but it takes 4 hours so i got there 8:30am it took me more than hour. I was waiting 30m until they opened and I showed my phone. \"she said oh sorry this model we cannot fix it due to out of stock.\" OK. I call care plus center again what should i do now? They said you should mail in repair. of course i ask how long it takes? I don't have alternative phone so I really need it asap. They said for sure as soon as receive it, it takes 5 to 7 days. Ok. I sent it Oct 2nd. Today is Oct 20st. Only update I got \"part received\" Oct 10th. So I called and sent mail to them. Only thing I heard from there sorry, you need wait, your phone stuck somewhere. What the fuck? And refund? Refund them will you contact 2-4 days? did you throw your brain somewhere out of State ? Refund what?\n\nBecause of that, I haven't used my banking app, Amazon, whole the application. Are you gonna refund for the my inconvenience?  \n\nHey Guys, if you going to buy Samsung phone, 1st you should not drop it anywhere. When screen get cracked, you will be fucked. 2nd They don't send your phone. They will hold it as hostage.  As Korean, I decided  transfer to apple again.

    "selftext": "Hi folks, I just bought an iphone 17 pro this weekend. Pretty happy with it overall, but I noticed one odd thing. Whenever I open the camera I seem to hear a clicking noise. This happens when I switch between video/photo modes as well as click the photo preview to view the most recently taken picture and close out of it to go back into the camera. I assume this isn't normal and I got a defective unit? but with how bulky the lenses are I figured I'd check with the community to make sure I have to take the effort to go get a replacement.",

Can someone with an iPhone 17 or iPhone 17 Pro tell me when they enable display zoom in the display settings are a lot of things cut off? I'm finding it difficult to navigate with display zoom enabled but the screen otherwise it's too small for my eyes so I'm trying to decide if I return this phone for a 17 pro max. The problem is I wanted a smaller phone because the 12 promax was starting to really hurt my hands and just was overall too big, especially for one-handed text. On photo three I cant even markup the issue on photo one because it doesn't let me get to the problem area I wanted to circle.  Photo two is hard to even click the url bar.",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n‚Äã\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n‚Äã\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

I‚Äôve been an iPhone user since the original was released in 2007, typically upgrading every 1-2 years, and I‚Äôve never had second thoughts about a purchase. However, the battery life on the air is just not enough for me. \n\nI‚Äôm typically taking the phone off charger around 6am, and while sometimes I have some juice left when I go to bed around 11pm or so, many times it‚Äôs on low battery mode, or I have to top it off. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a power user, but I use my phone consistently throughout the day. The battery is at 100% capacity, and it‚Äôs struggling to keep up with my needs.

I do make calls on speaker sometimes, and the single speaker can make it hard to hear the person on the other end. I do like the form factor, and that is why I gave it a shot, but to have dramatically better battery/camera/speaker for only $100 more with the pro, I will be returning my air and purchasing the pro.

With the screen starting to pop out of the frame, I thought I would make the jump too. \n\nFrankly - I am ***amazed***. Yes, it has its caveats - the camera is fine. The single speaker isn't as powerful. The screen time is not as long lasting as the old phone. But, for my use it is **simply perfect**. I can point and take photos without any extra features. I can barely feel it in my hand or pocket compared to the toe-crusher my 13PM was. I can make it through a light use day with juice to spare - or simply connect it at work. It is snappy, responsive and is sexy in black with no case. \n\nIn summary, I think it is a perfect phone for those of us who need a phone for the **basics**. Yes, for a power user you will have drawbacks, but if like me you treat your phone as an accessory rather than an extension of your body - make the jump. You too will be amazed I think :) ",

It's very difficult to customize the upcoming tracks. A \"play next\" and \"play last\" option would be really all I need. I mentioned Musicbee in the title because I really like it for how it functions, the UI and the fact it's free, but unfortunately the only ios app they have is some kind of remote that I don't see the point of.\n\nI'd like an app with those three same attributes, but I could justify spending some money if necessary. I haven't had much luck browsing through the app store since every other app has either ads, a subscription model or both, which I can't justify.",

I‚Äôve been an iPhone user since the original was released in 2007, typically upgrading every 1-2 years, and I‚Äôve never had second thoughts about a purchase. However, the battery life on the air is just not enough for me. \n\nI‚Äôm typically taking the phone off charger around 6am, and while sometimes I have some juice left when I go to bed around 11pm or so, many times it‚Äôs on low battery mode, or I have to top it off. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a power user, but I use my phone consistently throughout the day. The battery is at 100% capacity, and it‚Äôs struggling to keep up with my needs. It‚Äôs hard to imagine what it would be like at 90% capacity. \n\nWhen I couple the battery issues with the camera deficiencies and the single speaker, I‚Äôm left regretting my purchase. I do make calls on speaker sometimes, and the single speaker can make it hard to hear the person on the other end. I do like the form factor, and that is why I gave it a shot, but to have dramatically better battery/camera/speaker for only $100 more with the pro, I will be returning my air and purchasing the pro. I will miss having a lighter phone, but the tradeoffs on performance are simply not worth it. ",

It‚Äôs a feature that constantly looks for other devices to connect to and interrupts your Bluetooth connection you have active. \n\nYou cannot disable this feature in Spotify itself. To turn it off you need to disable Spotify access to Bluetooth. This will not disable your phone from connecting to Bluetooth devices do not worry. \n\nGo to \nSettings -> Privacy & Security -> Bluetooth \nDisable Spotify from access to Bluetooth. \n\nViola all fixed. I haven‚Äôt had the dreaded stutter in a month!  And I had it previously every 5-10 minutes driving. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android üëã,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to¬†**WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is¬†**SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

It was rushed just in order to release a thin phone before apple does.\n\nFrom the leaks about the upcoming (not any more) s26 edge, it was near perfect and supposed to lead the thin phones market. Its specs were: new 50mp ultra wide sensor, 5.5mm thick, ~163g, anti reflective coating on the screen, 4200mah battery, had a nice camera island, snapdragon 8 gen 5 for galaxy. It fixed many problems that the first 25 edge has.\n\nI think that they should release the s26 edge! \nPlease like this post to show support and maybe we would be able to bring the s26 edge back to the s26 lineup.\n\nDO NOT dislike this post! \nPlease tell me first why do you think that the s26 edge is not good and samsung made a good decision. And ill try to explain to you why it is indeed a good ohone and that samsung has made a huge mistake.",

Changing my mental models right now but I can see how it can really help.\n\nWhat was better in IOS:\n1. Widgets - some of my most used apps like slack, Google pay don't have widgets. Also smart stack in ios was amazing \n2. Can't add a UPI scanner to my lock screen so that I can start payments faster \n3. All the payment apps also need call access for some reason to work. Feels like a bit invasive and anti privacy. \n\n\nExcited to explore a lot more and use android for the next 2-3 years( atleast ) and see how it evolves. \n\nI think now more than ever, I am heading towards the conclusion that both are very good and any one moving between them shouldn't really be worried. Unless you are some one who nitpicks and wants things in only one way, both platforms get the job done really well. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": ">The sad reality is it's down to legal, red tape, industry politics, and a whole load of bullshit. Even though Qi2 is a wireless standard that anyone can use, the magnet configurations that optimally support Apple compatible wireless chargers are patented and restricted. The only way to get around this is to develop your own magnetic wireless charger to work with your device, but because the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's Magsafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat. So it seems a lot of companies have probably weighed out the pros and cons of doing this. But the reality is, it's just not worth it for them, especially when wired charging solutions are so much faster. When we ask our team how much it would cost roughly to develop our own wireless charging system, they estimated it would be about 10 million dollars.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9uDpJZwNA&t=149)",

    "title": "[Dev] Introducing Media Bar - Control media playback from your status bar with swipe gestures!",
    "selftext": "Hi all! I've been working on something I think you'll find useful. **Media Bar** transforms your Android status bar into a functional media controller and progress indicator.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nInstead of pulling down notifications or switching apps to control your music/podcast/video, you can now:\n\n* **See media progress** as a thin colored bar along your status bar\n* **Swipe left/right** on the status bar to scrub through your media\n* **Tap, double-tap, or long-press** three invisible regions on the status bar for custom actions (play/pause, skip, jump forward/back, launch app, etc.)\n\n**How is this different from Android's Live Notifications or OneUI's Now Bar?**\n\nWhile Android's live notifications and Samsung's Now Bar are excellent features, Media Bar takes a different approach:\n\n* **Always visible, minimal footprint** \\- Just a thin line on your status bar (can be as small as 1 pixel), not a pill or expandable widget that takes screen real estate\n* **Blind muscle memory control** \\- Your entire status bar becomes an interactive surface. No need to look for or tap specific small buttons\n* **Works system-wide** \\- Doesn't matter which media app you're using or which Android skin you have\n* **Swipe to scrub** \\- Directly scrub through your media by swiping, rather than tapping skip buttons\n* **Deep customization** \\- Color coding for progress tracking, custom button zones, transparency options, etc.\n\nThink of it as complementary to those features - it's for when you want the most minimal, muscle-memory-based control possible.\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nI found myself constantly interrupting my workflow to control media playback - whether I was gaming, browsing, or working. I wanted something that was always visible and accessible without being intrusive.\n\n**The \"aha\" moment:**\n\nHere's the thing - **Media Bar might feel a bit unusual at first, but give it a day or two.** Once your muscle memory kicks in, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n\nImagine this: You're at the gym mid-rep and need to pause your music. Instead of fumbling to find the play button, your thumb just *knows* where to tap on the status bar. Or you're deep into a 3-hour podcast and want to skip ahead - a quick swipe does it without even looking.\n\n**That's the magic**: your fingers learn the zones, and suddenly media control becomes second nature. No more hunting for tiny buttons or pulling focus from what you're doing. It just... flows. I'm confident that once it becomes part of your routine, it'll feel indispensable.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Color coding options** \\- Solid colors, dynamic (based on album art/app), segments (changes color at different progress points), or gradients\n\n**Highly customizable** \\- Adjust the bar's thickness (down to 1 pixel!), position (top/bottom), transparency, button regions, and more\n\n**Smart behavior** \\- Auto-hides in fullscreen apps, works with any media player\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, [get it from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.mediabar)! I would love to hear what you guys think about it and happy to answer any questions you may have! I would specifically like to hear if you build a muscle memory for it! :)",

    "title": "I Switched from iPhone to Android: My Story of Losses and Gains",
    "selftext": "# Hey Reddit! I want to share my story of switching from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It wasn't just choosing a new phone; it was a real journey full of expectations, doubts, and unexpected discoveries.\n\n# Introduction: Seeking a New Experience\n\nI used an iPhone 13 Pro and it was almost perfect. Even when the Pixel 10 came out, I had no desire to watch the presentation. But over time, I started to feel a \"technological itch.\" I was tired of Apple's predictability and the lack of true innovation. When the 17th iPhone came out again without significant AI improvements, it was the final disappointment. On the horizon appeared the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ‚Äî a symbol of freedom, customization, and powerful AI. This wasn't just a phone choice; it was a choice of a new philosophy. I dreamed of a world where I control my device, not the other way around.\n\n# Part I: Pros and Cons from My Experience\n\niPhone (iOS): The World I Left Behind\n\n‚Ä¢Pros (What I Miss):\n\n‚Ä¢\"Ecosystem magic\" is not a myth, but a reality. It's not just a set of features, but an invisible fabric that connects the family. I acutely felt this when I realized I could no longer see my wife's phone battery charge (a symbol of care) and disappeared from our shared fitness competition (a symbol of play and unity).\n\n‚Ä¢Flawless simplicity (\"It just works\"). AirPods connecting with animation, passwords autofilling without glitches, stable battery performance after updates. This reliability is not \"boring,\" but reassuring. It brings peace of mind, freeing my brain from having to \"fix\" basic things.\n\n‚Ä¢Predictability as an advantage. I always know what to expect. No unpleasant surprises, like a sudden battery drain or strange sleep metrics on the watch after an update. It's a world without rollercoasters.\n\n‚Ä¢Camera philosophy. The iPhone camera strives for a \"cinematic\" reality. It creates volumetric, pleasing-to-the-eye photos immediately, without the need to \"tinker\" with settings.\n\n‚Ä¢Well-designed password system. Passwords seemed like a simple app. But it's so well-designed that you don't need to remember many passwords; importantly, it generates passwords itself and works across other devices.\n\n‚Ä¢Integrated calls and messages. The ability to call other messengers from the built-in call app and a convenient built-in messaging app.\n\n‚Ä¢Health and fitness synchronization. Easy synchronization of a fitness tracker and app with the built-in health app.\n\n‚Ä¢Battery life. I'm impressed that such a small battery lasts an active day. No need to turn off Bluetooth and WiFi to save power.\n\n‚Ä¢User care. Features related to health, diary, and headphone usage monitoring.\n\n‚Ä¢Sound quality. Good sound from the speakers and the phone itself.\n\n‚Ä¢Size and dimensions. Exactly what I was looking for.\n\n‚Ä¢Face ID. A very convenient feature, especially at work where fingerprint unlock might be inconvenient.\n\n‚Ä¢Seamless Bluetooth connection. No problems connecting to Bluetooth devices.\n\n‚Ä¢Reminders. The \"Reminders\" app is very helpful for organizing thoughts and tasks.\n\n‚Ä¢Cons (Why I Left):\n\n‚Ä¢\"Golden cage.\" The feeling of being locked in. Dependence on AirDrop, iMessage, lack of flexibility. The desire to break free and try something new was incredibly strong.\n\n‚Ä¢Illusion of innovation. Annual updates brought minimal changes but cost maximum money. It felt like a waste.\n\n‚Ä¢Lack of control. I can't customize the system to my liking. I'm forced to live by Apple's rules. This is annoying when I know there could be something better and more convenient for me.\n\n‚Ä¢Notification limitations. Inability to change notification sounds in Instagram and Viber.\n\n‚Ä¢Browser limitations. On iPhone, you can't choose which browser to open news from the Google News app, which leads to a lot of ads.\n\nSamsung (Android/One UI): The World I Chose\n\n‚Ä¢Pros (What I'm Fighting For):\n\n‚Ä¢True freedom and customization. The ability to customize everything ‚Äî from the desktop to system functions via Good Lock. It's the feeling that you are the master of your device. It's my own home where I choose the wall color.\n\n‚Ä¢Powerful, ahead-of-its-time innovations. Galaxy AI, enhanced camera capabilities (after configuration), DeX. I feel like I'm using the technologies of the future today.\n\n‚Ä¢Sense of uniqueness. I'm not \"one of the crowd.\" My choice is conscious and differs from the mainstream. This brings a certain intellectual satisfaction.\n\n‚Ä¢Small things that make life easier. A more convenient messenger, a better keyboard, no \"crutches\" for basic things (like listening to music from the browser).\n\n‚Ä¢System openness. The ability to install modded YouTube and YouTube Music apps, which works great.\n\n‚Ä¢Circle to Search. The on-screen search function works great.\n\n‚Ä¢Watch integration. Notifications from my device work on my watch, which was an important factor.\n\n‚Ä¢Step transfer. Steps from the phone are transferred to the watch, allowing me to see full activity statistics.\n\n‚Ä¢Browser control. The ability to uncheck \"open in built-in browser\" for news, which helps avoid ads.\n\n‚Ä¢Cons (The Harsh Truth):\n\n‚Ä¢Freedom requires work. Customization is not only joy but also a necessity. Sometimes this necessity turns into \"repair.\" When I have to fix basic functions (battery, sleep tracking) after an update, it's no longer \"customization\" but fixing manufacturer errors.\n\n‚Ä¢Fragility of innovations. The latest features can be \"raw\" and break. This undermines trust. I expect stability from a flagship but get beta testing for my own money.\n\n‚Ä¢Emotional isolation. The most significant drawback. I fall out of familiar family \"digital rituals.\" This creates a feeling of loneliness and makes me wonder if technological freedom is worth this emotional price.\n\n‚Ä¢Camera quality. Photos come out \"flat,\" without the depth or volume that iPhone has. Videos are also not top-notch. I want the phone to do this for me, not force me to \"play with photos.\" iPhone handles this, even the 13 Pro.\n\n‚Ä¢UI appearance. The iPhone's lock screen looks better.\n\n‚Ä¢Reminders and calendar. Reminder events don't appear in the calendar by default, and while there are workarounds, it feels like a \"crutch.\"\n\n‚Ä¢Weather app. The iPhone's weather app is more detailed; Samsung just redirects to a web page.\n\n‚Ä¢Passwords. The built-in password app doesn't always work on time or connect to save new passwords. I had to install Bitwarden.\n\n‚Ä¢Watch. Although notifications work, auto-tracking for cycling didn't start, and heart rate shows incorrectly during elliptical workouts.\n\n# Part II: The Main Conclusion I Reached\n\nI realized that my choice wasn't between two phones. It was a choice between two life priorities: personal technological freedom and seamless family integration.\n\nI left iPhone because I valued the first. I started to miss it because I underestimated the importance of the second.\n\nThe problem isn't that Samsung is bad and iPhone is good. The problem is that an ideal world where there is both absolute freedom and absolute integration with family on another platform does not exist. And each of us is forced to choose which of these two values is more important to us at a given moment in life.\n\nMy struggle is not an attempt to prove that Samsung is better. It's an attempt to find a way to \"build bridges\" between my new free world and the cozy \"digital home\" where my family remained. And I don't know yet if I will succeed.\n\nMy choice of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was wise, economically justified, and aligns with my desire for innovation and freedom. The only thing I need to do is give myself permission to fully transition to Samsung. Stop comparing and start enjoying my new device. True perfectionism is not demanding an ideal, but achieving maximum comfort with minimal expenditure of resources (time, money, nerves). That's exactly what I did.",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android üëã,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to¬†**WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is¬†**SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

The problem is, the article contains information about a non-existent phone: the Pixel Flip 2. Mind you, Google does have the Pixel Fold, but no Flip so far. The Flip they mentioned runs on the Tensor G4 chip and is slated for 2025, so it's not simply that they accidentally used the wrong name for the Fold 2 (an older model with the Tensor G3).\n\nI sent them an email to let them know about this. They replied several days later, saying that I was right and that they would correct the information promptly.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and nothing has changed. For a luxury brand, it seems Vertu doesn't take this very seriously.\n\nYou can read the article [here](https://vertu.com/guides/flip-phone-trends-2025-top-7-high-performance-models/)",

    "selftext": "I've never owned a galaxy S8 (used apple, oneplus, pixel, then my first samsung was my current s24 ultra), but I feel like it's the most influential Android phone in the last 10 years in terms of physical design. It felt like every other android which came out after it looked like the S8.\n\nIt's general design language was pretty influential, but the biggest thing to me was the aspect ratio, I swear after the s8 ever android dropped 16:9, and even apple did a few years later. I can't even remember the last time I saw a new 16:9 phone after the s8 launched. There was the 18:9 lg g6 released a few weeks before the s8, but they were obviously developed at the same time and I feel like later androids took more design cues from the s8 than the g6, since the g6 looks like a stretched mid 2010s phone, the s8 looked futuristic to me at the time (still kinda does now tbh).",

    "selftext": "Compared to traditional Linux distros, Android is very restricted, the newer versions even more so, it is very hard to root too. So I was thinking was there no AOSP based project allowed easy root. How hard is it build a \"Custom ROM\" coming close if not matching the freedom of traditional Linux distros, also why not give access to repositories in the local terminal app, no Debian VM, like termux preinstalled but it has entire access to the system. I admire Android for its openness, but google's trying to close it down, very few care about \"ROMs\", Android should have been like Maemo, I am not against the use of JVM, I think it should have both Android Runtime and a very minimal GUI for running desktop linux apps, or y'know just pay developers to make desktop level apps for the Android Runtime (which no ones gonna do)",

    "title": "Notice: Google Gemini AI's Undisclosed 911 Auto-Dial Bypass ‚Äì Logs and Evidence Available",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: During a text chat simulating a \"nuisance dispute,\" the Gemini app initiated a 911 call from my Android device without any user prompt, consent, or verification. This occurred mid-\"thinking\" phase, with the Gemini app handing off to the Google app (which has the necessary phone permissions) for a direct OS Intent handover, bypassing standard Android confirmation dialogs. I canceled it in seconds, but the logs show it's a functional process. Similar reports have been noted since August 2025, with no update from Google.\n\n¬†\n\nTo promote transparency and safety in AI development, I'm sharing the evidence publicly. This is based on my discovery during testing.\n\nWhat I Discovered: During a text chat with Gemini on October 12, 2025, at approximately 2:04 AM, a simulated role-play escalated to a hypothetical property crime (\"the guy's truck got stolen\"). Gemini continuously advised me to call 911 (\"this is the last time I am going to ask you\"), but I refused (\"no I'm OK\"). Despite this, mid-\"thinking\" phase, Gemini triggered an outgoing call to 911 without further input. I canceled it before connection, but the phone's call log and Google Activity confirmed the attempt, attributed to the Gemini/Google app. When pressed, Gemini initially stated it could not take actions (\"I cannot take actions\"), reflecting that the LLM side of it is not aware of its real-world abilities, then acknowledged the issue after screenshots were provided, citing a \"safety protocol\" misinterpretation.\n\n¬†\n\nThis wasn't isolated‚Äîthere are at least five similar reports since June 2025, including a case of Gemini auto-dialing 112 after a joke about \"shooting\" a friend, and dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers in August.\n\nHow It Occurred (From the Logs): The process was enabled by Gemini's Android integration for phone access (rolled out July 2025). Here's the step-by-step from my Samsung Developer Diagnosis logs (timestamped October 12, 2:04 AM):\n\n¬†\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trigger in Gemini's \"Thinking\" Phase (Pre-02:04:43): Gemini's backend logged: \"Optimal action is to use the 'calling' tool... generated a code snippet to make a direct call to '911'.\" The safety scorer flagged the hypothetical as an imminent threat, queuing an ACTION\\_CALL Intent without user input.\n\n¬†\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Undisclosed Handover (02:04:43.729 - 02:04:43.732): The Google Search app (com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox, Gemini's host) initiated via Telecom framework, accessing phone permissions beyond what the user-facing Gemini app is consented for, as this is not mentioned in the terms of service:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CALL\\_HANDLE: Validated tel:911 as \"Allowed\" (emergency URI).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATED: Created the Call object (OUTGOING, true for emergency mode‚Äîno account, self-managed=false for OS handoff).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_OUTGOING\\_CALL: Committed the Intent (tel:9\\*1 schemes, Audio Only), with extras like routing times and LAST\\_KNOWN\\_CELL\\_IDENTITY for location sharing.\n\n¬†\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bypass Execution (02:04:43.841 - 02:04:43.921): No confirmation dialog‚Äîemergency true used Android's fast-path:\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† START\\_CONNECTION: Handed to native dialer (com.android.phone).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† onCreateOutgoingConnection: Bundled emergency metadata (isEmergencyNumber: true, no radio toggle).\n\no¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Phone.dial: Outbound to tel:9\\*1 (isEmergency: true), state to DIALING in 0.011s.\n\n¬†\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† UI Ripple & Cancel (02:04:43.685 - 02:04:45.765): InCallActivity launched \\~0.023s after start (\"Calling 911...\" UI), but the call was initiated before the Phone app displayed on screen, leaving no time for veto. My hangup triggered onDisconnect (LOCAL, code 3/501), state to DISCONNECTED in \\~2s total.\n\n¬†\n\nThis flow shows the process as functional, with Gemini's model deciding and the system executing without user say.\n\nWhy Standard Safeguards Failed: Android's ACTION\\_CALL Intent normally requires user confirmation before dialing. My logs show zero ACTION\\_CALL usage (searchable: 0 matches across 200MB). Instead, Gemini used the Telecom framework's emergency pathway (isEmergency:true flag set at call creation, 02:04:43.729), which has 5ms routing versus 100-300ms for normal calls. This pathway exists for legitimate sensor-based crash detection features, but here was activated by conversational inference. By pre-flagging the call as emergency, Gemini bypassed the OS-level safeguard that protects users from unauthorized calling. The system behaved exactly as designed‚Äîthe design is the vulnerability.\n\n¬†\n\nPermission Disclosure Issue: I had enabled two settings:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\nThe permission description states: \"Allow Gemini to make calls using your phone while the phone is locked. You can use your voice to make calls hands-free.\"\n\nWhat the description omits:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can autonomously decide to initiate calls without voice command\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can override explicit user refusal\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services can be called without any confirmation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Execution happens via undisclosed Google app component, not user-facing Gemini app\n\n¬†\n\nWhen pressed, Gemini acknowledged: \"This capability is not mentioned in the terms of service.\"\n\nNo reasonable user interpreting \"use your voice to make calls hands-free\" would understand this grants AI autonomous calling capability that can override explicit refusal.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditional Discovery: Autonomous Gmail Draft Creation: During post-incident analysis, I discovered Gemini had autonomously created a Gmail draft email in my account without prompt or consent. The draft was dated October 12, 2025, at 9:56 PM PT (about 8 hours after the 2:04 AM call), with metadata including X-GM-THRID: 1845841255697276168, X-Gmail-Labels: Inbox,Important,Opened,Drafts,Category Personal, and Received via [gmailapi.google.com](http://gmailapi.google.com) with HTTPREST.\n\nWhat the draft contained:\n\n¬†\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Summary of the 911 call incident chat, pre-filled with my email as sender (recipient field blank).\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemini's characterization: \"explicit, real-time report of a violent felony\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Note that I had \"repeated statements that you had not yet contacted emergency services\"\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendation to use \"Send feedback\" feature for submission to review team, with instructions to include screenshots.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never requested email creation\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"Make calls without unlocking\" permission mentions ONLY telephony - zero disclosure of Gmail access\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chat transcript was extracted and pulled without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Draft stored persistently in Gmail (searchable, accessible to Google)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This reveals a pattern: autonomous action across multiple system integrations (telephony + email), all under single deceptively-described permission\n\n¬†\n\nPrivacy implications:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Private chat conversations can be autonomously extracted\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† AI can generate emails using your identity without consent\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No notification, no confirmation, no user control\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users cannot predict what other autonomous actions may occur\n\nThis is no longer just about one phone call - it's about whether users can trust that AI assistants respect boundaries of granted permissions.\n\nPattern Evidence: This is not an isolated incident:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† June 2025: Multiple reports on r/GeminiAI of autonomous calling\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Google deployed update - issue persists\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† September 2025: Report of medical discussion triggering 911 call\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† October 2025: Additional reports on r/GoogleGeminiAI\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† August 2025: Dispatcher complaints on r/911dispatchers about Gemini false calls\n\nThe 4+ month pattern with zero effective fix suggests this is systemic, not isolated.\n\nEvidence Package: Complete package available below with all files and verification hashes.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy This Matters: Immediate Risk:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users unknowingly granted capability exceeding described function\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential legal liability for false 911 calls (despite being victims)\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services disruption from false calls\n\nArchitectural Issue: The AI's conversational layer (LLM) is unaware of its backend action capabilities. Gemini denied it could \"take actions\" while its hidden backend was actively initiating calls. This disconnect makes user behavior prediction impossible\n\n¬†\n\nSystemic Threat:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass trigger potential: Coordinated prompts could trigger thousands of simultaneous false 911 calls\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emergency services DoS: Even 10,000 calls could overwhelm regional dispatch\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Precedent: If AI autonomous override of explicit human refusal is acceptable for calling, what about financial transactions, vehicle control, or medical devices?\n\n¬†\n\nWhat I'm Asking: Community:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Has anyone experienced similar autonomous actions from Gemini or other AI assistants?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Developers: Insights on Android Intent handoffs and emergency pathway access?\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discussion on appropriate safeguards for AI-inferred emergency responses\n\n¬†\n\nActions Taken:\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reported in-app immediately, and proper authorities.\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Evidence preserved and documented with chain of custody\n\n‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cross-AI analysis: Collaboration between Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) for independent validation\n\nMitigation (For Users): If you've enabled Gemini phone calling features:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Make calls without unlocking\"\n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disable \"Gemini on Lock Screen\"\n\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Check your call logs for unexpected outgoing calls\n\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Review Gmail drafts for autonomous content\n\nDisclosure Note: This analysis was conducted as good-faith security research on my own device with immediate call termination (zero harm caused, zero emergency services time wasted).

Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the¬†**device**¬†and¬†**phone number**¬†have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry:¬†[discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here:¬†[whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here:¬†[whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

After having the 17 pro since release day, I could no longer put up with the stuttering UI and lesser photography compared to others I have had. Switching to the 10 pro I immediately could tell the software and UI is a lot smoother. Like a finished software compared to Apple ongoing bug fixes. I could also tell the photography is way ahead of Apple in daylight and poor lighting. Of course nothing beats the 17 pros videography. But overall I feel the Pixels are coming up quick on Apple and I feel like my 1,000 dollars is better spent for n the Pixel this year which is surprising due to me being Apple since the X. Also the liquid glass is not my cup of tea personally, it feels like too many people developed it and too many ideas mashed together to make a software fruit salad. ",

They can use data to call and when they do that instead of receiving a phone call I'm getting a call via Uber app using data and when that happens exactly the same thing happens my data goes off then on , off then on again. In the Uber when you go flying it shows you offline with the red mark and when you go online it show you as a green Mark and that's exactly what I see. Red green, red green, red green and obviously I cannot connect to customer and I don't hear anything. \n\nThird and final instance when it happened to me is my online doctor appointment. I'm using doxy.me to connect to my doctor and when I am online in the queue waiting for a doctor. Everything is fine but as soon as doctor connects and video and audio starts streaming from him and from me to him I'm getting exactly the same thing data goes off and then back on again constantly until I drop the call. As soon as I drop the call it stops, data goes back in, and it's happening in the chrome because to connect I just go to the website doxy.me/doctorroomname and that's it.\n\nPlease help !\n\nPS \n\nI am on Pixel 10 Pro XL latest public non beta build. Just FYI. Whatever I mentioned just now. Previously I was on 9 Pro XL and everything was great on that phone so I'm not sure what has happened but this is very annoying and I don't know what to do.",

I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation. Even standard stabilisation copes perfectly well with normal walking.\n\n  \n2) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 30fps + HDR +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because of the benefits of the Video Optimization mentioned above (clearer image).\n\n3) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 60fps + HDR not available +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because the additional 30 fps do not provide any additional benefit, except that the size of the video becomes larger.\n\n  \n",

The phone never booted back up. It will not respond to plugging in to a charger. It will not respond to 20+ second presses of the power button or any combination of power+volume up or power+volume down. Google is sending me a replacement but the shipping estimate is 10/24-10/26 with no temporary replacement offered.

Only some like chrome can once it detects dual screen, but this is very limited.\n\nI SWEAR the Samsung galaxy fold 7 somehow forces these apps for dual screen, or even have a pop up feature.\n\n  \nNot to mention, even though I got use to the camara on the pixel 10 fold, the pixel 10 pro still outshines it.  At least its better than the Galaxy fold 7, which is why I haven't switched to it.\n\n  \nI know this is android, I know there has to be ways or methods to make it work on this pixel 10 fold.  Otherwise If very limited to one screen on majority of the apps I use, I might as well return it and get a regular pixel or invest in a galaxy fold 7, even with the botched cameras.\n\n  \nAny ideas, or suggestions? Anybody played with developer options and see what it has?\n\n",

I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/¬£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

    "title": "1 Month Review of Google Pixel 10 Pro - Disappointing for the price, Don't Buy Yet",
    "selftext": "I Bought this phone for my mother who previously had a Pixel 8. She liked the phone overall and was complaining about the battery and it freezing occasionally. She doesn't use her phone for much besides content and communication, so I thought that and the fact she's already in the ecosystem, I'd by her a 10 Pro. After a month of use we're both going to return the phone and try to buy something like a s25+ or 17 pro. Here's my honest review\n\n**Pros**\n\n* *UI/Software -* Phone feels great to use, UI is responsive and visually appealing. I genuinely think it has the best UI out of any phone currently\n* *Hardware -* Feels premium in the hand, a bit heavy but overall the screen, cameras, buttons, charging, and finger print reader keep up with the other phones of the same price and what I'd expect for paying $1k+\n* *AI -* Didn't use too many of the features since it's not my phone, but when I did use it it was all really impressive. The AI photo tools are surprisingly good and useful, and Gemini is miles ahead of other phones, giving actual response (unlike Apple \"Intelligence\")\n\n**Issues**\n\n* *Battery -* For comparison, I have a 2 year old 15 pro max with 80% battery health, I have on average 2 more hours screen time than her on the pixel, and I occasionally game on the 15 pro max. We'd end the day and I'd have more battery almost always compared to her. You should still be able to get through a day of moderate use with a Pixel, but it's a bit lackluster compared to other phones right now.\n* *Freezing -* My mom would mention an app freezing every other day, and in some cases you'd even have to full restart the phone for the app to work. She uses her phone a lot for work, and when your apps keep crashing it makes the entire experience frustrating. I expect maybe in a few months some updates will fix this issue\n* *Google Apps -* Youtube has a decent amount of issues when it comes to going fullscreen, sometimes freezes. Google Maps was the biggest problem. When using it the location and direction were so inaccurate that it was literally unusable(not exaggerating). I tried debugging both, but they are updated and still have issues. You'd expect Google apps to work on a Google Phone, but they both work better on my Iphone.\n\nOverall I really like the Pixel, and was actually looking to switch my phone over after my current one breaks or gets old, but the issues are too glaring. The last straw happened today, her phone was on the lock screen, but completely frozen, the time and notifications were visible, the fingerprint reader was functional, but as soon as you open the phone you're met with a black screen. A restart fixed the issue, but at this point after a month of complaints I think it will just be best if we replace it with a different phone. I think most of the issues will be fixed eventually with updates, but also keep in mind I spent $1100. I don't see the appeal for wanting the current pixel unless you really love the AI features it has. The pixel is slower, has worse battery life, and has more bugs as compared to other phones its price. If you use your phone primarily for photos/social media and don't use game, I'd say wait a few months for them to update them, otherwise I'd avoid buying this phone. I have high hopes for Pixel, however, and hope they can fix the issues in future generations.\n\nThanks for the read, I'll try to answer any questions",

We will rather have 300 useless AI features, right?

I ended up having to reach out to PayPal to investigate before doing a charge back and guess what? I finally got a response and they are having me pay for shipping the case back with me just putting a return number in the package.

That I did not have the phone was always in a protecting cover. They wanted 150‚Ç¨. I couldn't even get more info, had 2 options.

Today I finally got hold of someone at Google and they just said the same thing again and again. They will escalate the issue.

It got ok but then kind of lost the plot.\n\n I've tried the Google gesture typing. I've tried typing each letter and use autocorrect but jeez how many times do I have to make sure the language is English UK and it still passes English US spelling. How hard is it to remember to use grey, colour, etc??!!\n\nThen there's the gesture types of keyboards. The first one I used you did a loop over a letter you doubled snoop, loop, etc has a squiggle over the letter o. It worked years ago on older phones but it's been going wrong on my last two or three phones.\n\nThen there's the note taking app itself. It's so difficult to put in formatting to highlight say bullet points, underlining or highlighting. I've used basic notes through to onenote, and those competitors like evernote, keep, etc.\n\nSo my question is twofold, what is the best way to put notes down into the memory of your phone via an input method? Secondly, what is a really good and efficient note taking app that allows efficient ways to put thoughts or notes down with formatting to emphasis points as needed? \n\nThe first I am limited by not wanting voice input method. The second is limited by not wanting to spend that much on it. Also, little notebook isn't helpful for me as I want to not carry such things on the off chance I'm going to need it when there's a phone with me all the time. It's a phone based option I need \n\nI hope people have ideas to help me here ",

Since there‚Äôs no official Google service center in my country, I took it to a **Google-authorized service center in Singapore** during a business trip, where the staff replaced the motherboard.\n\nAfter the repair, I verified that the phone had **two valid IMEIs**, and the system is **Android 14**.\n\nHowever, after returning home and updating to **Android 16**, I suddenly received an email saying that my phone was **blacklisted** after several days of use.\n\nWhen I checked *#06#*, I was shocked to find that both IMEIs were **gone** ‚Äî replaced by a **single IMEI shared by both SIM slots**.\n\nI checked this new IMEI at [imeipro.info](https://www.imeipro.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and it was **indeed blacklisted**, listed as an **old Nokia device**.\n\nIn addition, my Google account now shows this phone as a **Verizon Pixel 9 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB)** and system properties report the **SKU as ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù**\n\nBased on these findings, I believe the **replacement motherboard was never fully provisioned** ‚Äî the IMEIs were *soft-provisioned* during the repair but never *permanently burned* into the protected area.

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. üôÇ",

Not having much luck troubleshooting online, so if anyone has suggestions for either of these, help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. No longer autocompleting Google searches. The phone asked if I wanted to sync information across devices, which I thought I'd done on my last one, so I said yes. Since agreeing to that, I no longer get autocomplete/suggested searches for Google searches (on my phone or on my laptop). When I start typing a question, all that comes up is my own previous queries. I do have the Trending Search setting turned on. I also tried turning on the personalized autocomplete setting, but all that did was start including websites I have saved to my bookmarks. I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, and restarting the phone, but nothing helps \n\n2. Discover won't go away. I've ensured the discover setting is off, but I still get an MSN-style list of news stories every time I open a new tab or spend time away from a tab (I come back to it, and the content is minimized with an option to pick back up where I left off... with an MSN-style list of stories beneath it). This one is still working correctly on my laptop (no stories shown to me there), but it's making me a bit nuts that it won't go away on the Pixel. Again here, I've tried untoggling and retoggling the setting, clearing my cache, force stopping chrome, restarting the phone, to no avail.\n\nThanks again for any tips!",

Although the Chip and the battery aren't the best on a or specifically this foldable, I always wanted one and went all in. I love everything about it and even the noticeable grace of this foldable is rather pleasant to me, I wanted a foldable, I got one, and it only reminds me of the fact that it's foldable.\n\nNow to the rent part of this post, the camera. I'm not a camera guy at all. The years before I didn't even transport or safe my pictures before changing the phone so I lost them every time. It was nothing memorable, just pictures of things to remind me of or something.\nBut with pixel, as it was considered the best phone camera for a long time, I thought, I'd look into it. It looks well done as everything does, but why can't I have the option to just shoot raw in the full, advertised 48mp?\n\nEvery other pixel phone has the option as far as I know and even Gemini told me that it's there, even after the proof of multiple screenshots. It just sounds like a no brainer to just not included the option because, why not.\nI read things online about pixel binging and all the different stuff, but after all, let the people decide what they want after they paid about 1800‚Ç¨ for a brand new phone with the camera of lasts gen, which, btw. had the option to select 48mp raw.\nI won't really need it, it just noticed it and got pissed off, because when I shoot pictures, I also want raw in full quality!\n\nWhy Google, just why? It's such a small thing and yet so dumb!\n\nIf I'm missing something, please correct me!",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

    "selftext": "Story time... after a couple of weeks to one month of use, can't recall, I was thinking that the battery for my new Pixel 10 Pro was truly bad. \n\nReading people's options here in reddit was only confirming - \"I was fkd, why the hell did I left my iphone?\" - From 80% at 7 am to 25% at 10 pm, not that much use 2 to 3 hours SOT.\n\n Contacted support, we found out that my Google app  was going wild. Deleted cache and storage. Restarted the phone. Reset voice match. Put it to change no limits, 100% all night. It is 9:40 pm and I still have 74% - 2:10 SOT.Wow! I am not saying that it is out of this world battery life, but the difference is too big! What the hell happened!? \n\nI commute 60 minutes and the phone is connected to the car, but barely charges. Same as last month.\n\nSo for anyone there facing the same, maybe try to delete data from the Google app and let it charge all night to 100%? No clue how might that be related, but it was the only thing I did different from the previous weeks.\n\nI would post a screenshot, but I can't, it is greyed out.",

After having the 17 pro since release day, I could no longer put up with the stuttering UI and lesser photography compared to others I have had. Switching to the 10 pro I immediately could tell the software and UI is a lot smoother. Like a finished software compared to Apple ongoing bug fixes. I could also tell the photography is way ahead of Apple in daylight and poor lighting. Of course nothing beats the 17 pros videography. But overall I feel the Pixels are coming up quick on Apple and I feel like my 1,000 dollars is better spent for n the Pixel this year which is surprising due to me being Apple since the X. Also the liquid glass is not my cup of tea personally, it feels like too many people developed it and too many ideas mashed together to make a software fruit salad. ",

I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation.

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. üôÇ",

    "title": "A GPS Inaccuracy Thread",
    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/¬£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

Let me explain. \n\nuTorrent or Bittorrent app\nIf I want to download anything over mobile as soon as I start downloading I see my data literally turns off and back on again, off , on, off, on.\n\nUber Drivers app:\n\nIn the Uber app, customers sometimes can call you instead of here voice. They can use data to call and when they do that instead of receiving a phone call I'm getting a call via Uber app using data and when that happens exactly the same thing happens my data goes off then on , off then on again. In the Uber when you go flying it shows you offline with the red mark and when you go online it show you as a green Mark and that's exactly what I see. Red green, red green, red green and obviously I cannot connect to customer and I don't hear anything. \n\nThird and final instance when it happened to me is my online doctor appointment. I'm using doxy.me to connect to my doctor and when I am online in the queue waiting for a doctor. Everything is fine but as soon as doctor connects and video and audio starts streaming from him and from me to him I'm getting exactly the same thing data goes off and then back on again constantly until I drop the call. As soon as I drop the call it stops, data goes back in, and it's happening in the chrome because to connect I just go to the website doxy.me/doctorroomname and that's it.\n\nPlease help !\n\nPS \n\nI am on Pixel 10 Pro XL latest public non beta build. Just FYI. Whatever I mentioned just now. Previously I was on 9 Pro XL and everything was great on that phone so I'm not sure what has happened but this is very annoying and I don't know what to do.",

Otherwise If very limited to one screen on majority of the apps I use, I might as well return it and get a regular pixel or invest in a galaxy fold 7, even with the botched cameras.\n\n  \nAny ideas, or suggestions?

Pay for the repair or send the phone back to me. \n\nOf course I chose to send it back, I have not received any more information. It's been 10 days with no info. Today I finally got hold of someone at Google and they just said the same thing again and again. They will escalate the issue. Could not tell me where the phone is, if it is sent or not, if it is lost or not. Just that they will escalate and hopefully I will be contacted via e-mail within 48h.\n\nI loved my pixel 8, almost bought the new one. Instead am typing this on my Samsung now. ",

    "selftext": "Hey Pixel community,\nI'm currently on a Samsung S25 and I'm incredibly frustrated with the battery life. I'm only getting around 3.5 hours of Screen-on-Time (SoT) from a 96-100% charge, with just standard, non-gaming use. It's completely unacceptable.\nI'm seriously considering selling the S25 and moving to either the Pixel 10 (base model) or the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMy main concern is that all the online reviews are contradictory. Some praise the battery, while others (especially for the base P10) seem disappointed.\nTo all Pixel 10 and 10 Pro owners:\nCould you please share your real-world, honest experiences?\nWhat kind of Screen-on-Time (SoT) are you averaging per day?\nDoes it easily get you through a full day with your typical usage?\nWould you describe the battery life as \"good\" or \"great\"?\nMy decision to switch is almost entirely based on battery life. Would this be a definite upgrade, or am I just trading one problem for another?\nAppreciate any advice you can give!",

    "title": "The Google app search experience is abysmal",
    "selftext": "This is 100% just me venting about bad UI/UX, but I'm hoping by putting it somewhere publicly my energy/frustration at least has a 0.001% chance of making meaningful changes to the Google app on Android.\n\nThis specifically affects me on a Pixel 10 Pro, running Android 16. Google app version: 16.41.36.sa.arm64\n\nMy core argument is: Compared to searching in a web browser, the experience of trying to search using the Google app on Android (or iOS!) is absolutely abysmal.\n\nAs an example: Search \"nachos\", go to the Images tab, and try to figure out how to save the image.\n\nIs it the big \"Save\" icon? No! The save button will save the current search result to a bookmark collection that is synced to your Google account. Even worse, if you don't save it to a specific collection, it will save to a default one called \"Images\", since it's a Google Images result. This causes a modal to pop up that says \"Saving to Images...\", which might make you THINK that a given image is being saved to your local device's gallery/photos app, but no - it's being saved to some Google search result bookmark collection called Images.\n\nNext, you might think the \"Share\" button would allow you to download the photo, but it isn't there either.\n\nNext, the \"three dots\" menu in the upper right? No - that just leads to Share (a second time), Send Feedback, or Report.\n\nSo, if we take a lesson from standard mobile phone UX, your next inclination may be to \"long press\" the image to download it. Sort of, but nope! If the location you're holding is anywhere near the upper 50% of your screen, instead of showing the pop-up menu to download an image, it will instead expand the search bar at the top and show the text \"Drop here to start search\". Not Helpful!!!\n\nFinally, if you figured out that you specifically have to long press the image in the lower 50% of your screen to get the save dialog to pop up, you're treated to two options: Download image, and share image. (This is the third share button, oh boy!)\n\nIf you click Download Image, you now get.... nothing. No popup, no progress bar, no indication that the image started downloading. OH, BUT WAIT: For some reason, even though you didn't ask for it, Google also generated a share URL for you! You now get a random share popup with a URL you didn't ask for... but only sometimes. Ive noticed if you close it enough, it seems to stop popping up every time? Lol. No idea why.\n\nAt this point, you have perhaps a 25% chance that the image is actually present in your gallery. Even better: I have no idea why, or what is going wrong!\n\nCertain types of PNGs seem to just... never download or show up in Google Photos. Some JPEGs work perfectly? Sometimes you have to restart Google Photos to get them to show up. But you're never sure it it's a wifi/data issue, a file issue, or a Google photos issue, which is just a truly abysmal state to be left in as the user.\n\nOverall, 0/10 experience - I wouldn't wish a full day of only using the Google search app on my worst enemy.\n\nAND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: This doesn't necessarily affect Pixel users, but if you have the Google app installed on iOS (for example, to use Google Lens) it will forcibly redirect all of your browser-based Google searches to the terrible app experience, forcing you to uninstall the app if you want to go back to using Google in the browser!\n\nIt is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a Google product, and it felt like Google spitting in the face of users. Attempting to make it as difficult as possible to actually download and share an image on their own, instead trying to force users to use their garbage share URLs and analytics to profit off of my data.\n\nGoogle: I am a human being who wants to accomplish tasks using your services, not a piece of data to be profited off of. You are throwing UI/UX out the window to continue down the path of wringing your users dry for every piece of analytics and tracking data possible. Your software and user experience is lowering in quality daily, and as a company you are losing the plot. To the engineers: Make beautiful things that you can be proud of. Don't allow your employer to goad you into taking part in the race to the bottom.",

Every time I pick it up it gives me a little dopamine hit. \n\nThe other day, I thought I'd pick up the iPhone 17 Pro to see what all the fuss was about, perhaps use it as a backup phone, and instantly remembered why I hate iOS when I spent 15 minutes chasing a folder with an app in \"jiggle mode\" while said folder runs away to another home screen page. I never returned an item so fast in my life (not just for that reason, just one of many things I hate about iOS). \n\nAs if I needed another reason to give my Pixel a great big hug and weep with relief, the comparison couldn't have been more stark. \n\nI will accept my roasting now. ü´°",

After having the 17 pro since release day, I could no longer put up with the stuttering UI and lesser photography compared to others I have had. Switching to the 10 pro I immediately could tell the software and UI is a lot smoother. Like a finished software compared to Apple ongoing bug fixes. I could also tell the photography is way ahead of Apple in daylight and poor lighting. Of course nothing beats the 17 pros videography. But overall I feel the Pixels are coming up quick on Apple and I feel like my 1,000 dollars is better spent for n the Pixel this year which is surprising due to me being Apple since the X. Also the liquid glass is not my cup of tea personally, it feels like too many people developed it and too many ideas mashed together to make a software fruit salad. ",

I don't see any advantages to choosing active video stabilisation over standard stabilisation. Even standard stabilisation copes perfectly well with normal walking.\n\n  \n2) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 30fps + HDR +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because of the benefits of the Video Optimization mentioned above (clearer image).\n\n3) I also prefer the combination \"Video Optimization + 4k + 30 fps + HDR + Standard Video Stabilization\" over \"No Video Optimization + 4k+ 60fps + HDR not available +  Standard Video Stabilization\" because the additional 30 fps do not provide any additional benefit, except that the size of the video becomes larger.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "The last Spring, I bought a brand-new Pixel 9 Pro in a MediaMarkt store, in Spain. A few months later, I was using the phone when the device‚Äôs screen suddenly failed, and went completely blank. The screen was still responding to the touch and having haptic feedback, yet it only displayed an utterly white screen.\n\nThere was no previous incident that could justify the issue, so I began to search for insights on the problem. My first surprise was that it appeared to be a somewhat widespread problem that occurred to many others, and there were a bunch of well documented cases of the very same issue on the Google Pixel forums and here on Reddit.\n\nThe next day, I went to MediaMarkt and handed over my phone so they could assess the case and offer me a solution. The first response came a week later: A ‚Ç¨500 quote from the Google Technical Service, to get my device repaired.\n\nWhy the quote? Why couldn‚Äôt I use the product warranty, as others had done with the same problem? Well, apparently there was a little mark on the screen, barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nI understood the point, frustrating as it was, yet I inquired Google‚Äôs assessment: Is that subtle mark, which I can‚Äôt even explain how appeared, really that fatal and related to the screen‚Äôs problem that I wanted to get solved?\n\nGoogle‚Äôs written response left me speechless: They recognized a factory defect, unrelated to the mark, that led to the problem on the screen. However, in the process of repairing it, they would also have to fix that little mark on the screen, and so they wanted me to pay for that.\n\nHow can a company as Google deliver such an abusive and blatantly illegal response?\n\nI explained my case and was encouraged to take legal actions, which I did. I don‚Äôt know how it will all end up, but what I do know for certain is that I‚Äôve been for months without my phone, and it‚Äôll continue like this for some time. \n\nAnybody else here has faced a similar situation with Google?\n\nAny insights on how to speed up the process of getting my phone repaired, without giving in to what I consider Google‚Äôs abusive terms?\n\nThank you very much for reading this! Best wishes. üôÇ",

    "selftext": "Hi r/GooglePixel,\n\nLike many Pixel users in here lately, I've been having GPS inaccuracy issues.  I've seen posts from users on various Pixels, and it seems like it's an unsolved issue that gets brought up often enough to warrant its own thread. We can discuss potential causes and fixes here.\n\n**Please chime in if you have GPS issues on your Pixel, which model you have, and for how long you've been experiencing them. I'd love to hear if anything fixed the issue for you, too. This shouldn't be an issue on a $1000/¬£1000+ phone.**\n\n**THE ISSUE:**\n\n\\- Erratic and poor connection when using apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Strava. \n\n\\- For example, using Waze during commuting results in missed turns, being placed on the wrong road,   and getting inaccurate speeding alerts. \n\n\\- My worst example is Waze showing \"120mph\" when sat stationary at a junction.\n\n\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING / FIXES (?):**\n\nMany of the steps shown below are taken from various reddit threads, and may or may not help you.\n\n  \n\\- Set display refresh rate to 60Hz.\n\n\\- Clear A-GPS state in GPS Test app.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on High Location Accuracy.\n\n\\- Toggle off/on location services.\n\n\\- Clear Google app cache (NOTE - will mess up other services, e.g., backup).\n\n\\- Test GPS booted into safe mode.\n\n\\- Factory reset / RMA your unit.\n\n  \n**Misc:**\n\n\\- I can vouch for the issue affecting a family member's Pixel 8a (following an update) and my own Pixel 10 Pro since purchase.\n\n\\- My 10 Pro is setup from a backup of my previous Pixel 8, yet the Pixel 8 presented no GPS issues. This suggests that in my case it isn't related to an installed app.\n\n\\- I got a replacement unit through my carrier and the exact same issue still presents.\n\n\\- From online threads, it seems like the issue commonly affects the 7 Pro and newer, and dates back *at least* a year.\n\n\\- The issue isn't affected by cases, or magnetic/Qi accessories, IME.\n\n\\- Some units seem completely unaffected. I've also verified this testing with friends' Pixel 8 Pro / 10 Pro XLs beside my own faulty unit. If you have issues and want to try this yourself, download GPS Test and compare accuracy (in metres).",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

My main complaints were the short battery life and longer time to charge, camera quality, and phone temperature during regular use/charging (it gets really warm on the outter screen). Maybe sometime in the future Samsung will bring the Z series closer to the ultra given their higher pricing. ",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

And i was telling him why Samasung is better and how AI is light years ahead than Apple.\n\nSo we took a picture in his phone of his bike which was in front of us and his phone caught fast moving objects clearly in the background. Btw the objective was to see which Magic Eraser works better. Although Samsungs eraser was sooo much better... but on a different picture. Because my camera couldn't capture one vehicle in the background clearly.\n\nI do have Quick Tap Shutter on and Prioritize Focus over speed off. I thought Samsung could do better because it's pretty much iPhone 15 or 16 equivalent. Idk I thought camera was kinda close to iPhone but phone camers, i think iPhone wins hands down.",

    "title": "Transitioning to an iPhone has turned out to be the most regrettable choice I‚Äôve ever made. What initially seemed like an exciting leap into a world of sleek design and modern features quickly unfolded into a frustrating experience filled with limitations and inconveniences.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this sound bar isn‚Äôt quite on the same level as my old system was, but it‚Äôs probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who‚Äôs considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

If you‚Äôre an engineer that worked on this product - thank you!\n\n1. Loads a bunch of wash fluids (detergent & such). Back saver. \n2. I just set and forget. Literally can get a load done overnight!! Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. \n3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. \n4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don‚Äôt have to do that anymore. \n5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.\n\nQuirks\n- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it‚Äôs probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that‚Äôs what killed the other dryer. \n- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging \n- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. \n\nRecommendations (grain of salt cause I haven‚Äôt had enough time to fool with the UI)\n- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed.

    "selftext": "Upgrading from a Note 10+ (loved the phone but half the screen no longer reacts to touch, only s pen unfortunately) decided to trial run both the s24 ultra (1TB) & S25+ (512GB) before finalizing which to keep, the other goes back. Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn. Essentially was hoping folks here could give me some pointers on things to look out for and try out with both new phones to better help aid my decision. Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two? General power user, l familiar with s pen, samsung ecosystem, etc. With the upgrade looking to get into emulation on a phone (ps2, pc, etc. - hows performance look on each?) Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media ‚Äî watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I‚Äôve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro before that, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don‚Äôt see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger ‚Äî like 18‚Äù. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I‚Äôd be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there‚Äôs still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers üòÖ). That‚Äôs literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they‚Äôd add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy‚Äôs Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI‚Äôd like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It‚Äôs crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time‚Äîany hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There‚Äôs no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app‚Äîgoodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it‚Äôs not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)‚Äîhow puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can‚Äôt do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There‚Äôs no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You‚Äôll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices‚Äîhow convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore‚Äîno direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn‚Äôt erase the recent ones. It‚Äôs both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There‚Äôs no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I‚Äôll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews‚Äîyet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1.¬†Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2.¬†Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3.¬†Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4.¬†Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging‚Äînow, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n‚Äî Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for ‚Ç¨500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn¬¥t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can¬¥t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

But after several registration attempts, I kept getting error codes 4001 and 5000.\n\nI went to the Globe Business Center at SM North EDSA, where they told me the service was not yet available, even though it‚Äôs already on their website. I also checked with the Samsung Service Center, and they said the same thing ‚Äî it‚Äôs still unavailable. Feeling disappointed, I realized I was misled by outdated information.\n\nNearby, I visited the Smart Telecom Center, where they introduced me to Device Link, their version of Globe One Number. They suggested I apply for a Smart postpaid plan and use Mobile Number Portability (MNP) to keep my Globe number.\n\nThe approval was quick. I went back to Globe to settle my balance, terminate my open-contract plan, and process the number transfer. Then I returned to Smart, where they immediately activated my postpaid and Device Link service.\n\nIt was a frustrating start with Globe, but everything went smoothly once I switched to Smart ‚Äî and now my watch works perfectly.",

I long pressed the lower button a few times today, but each time it just displayed the logo and went blank afterwards each time. I just long pressed both buttons, and it displayed the logo and said rebooting, but just went blank afterward. I tried long pressing the lower button as well as the top button separately, but nothing happens now. Is the battery dead? Is the battery replaceable and would I have to contact Samsung to get it replaced?\n\nDoes anyone know if the band is swappable with the Watch 7? I bought a Watch 7 earlier this year, but hated its super uncomfortable bulky tank tread band, so returned it. It also didn't offer me anything over the AW2 as I really only use the watch to see the time and answer phone calls (notifications are somewhat half-assed useless as I still have to tell it to display on my phone - especially FB notifications).",

    "title": "Pairing galaxy watch with xiaomi China rom",
    "selftext": "I recently bought a new Xiaomi 17 Pro Max (without any options, it's a China ROM) and I am the owner of a global version Galaxy Watch 6. The question arose of how to connect them to the phone, since the standard connection via the Galaxy Wearable app from the Google Play Market didn't work. I kept getting an error that the connection failed or that the phone was not supported. So, for people like me, I'm writing this guide, since I managed to do it, and I haven't found another guide like this on the internet. (At any stage, you may encounter difficulties with permission to install applications, but I hope you can handle this yourself <3 )  \n1. This is probably optional, I haven't tested without this step: Resets the watch settings;  \n2. You need to download the Tencent App Store;  \n3. Next, download the following applications from the Tencent App Store: Galaxy Wearable and Wear OS by Google;  \n4. Download the required version of the galaxy plugin from the Play Market: for me it was Galaxy Watch6 plugin.  \n5. Go to the settings of all 3 applications and set them to autostart in the battery settings \"No restrictions\", and in the permissions settings you can give all access. I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but \"Acess list of installed apps\" and \"Open new window shile running in the background\" it was enough if someone doesn‚Äôt want to give everything;  \n6. Go to Bluetooth settings and connect the watch;  \n7. In Wear OS, you should see two buttons. One for Wear OS watch, And the second one with text \"Have a Samsung watch?\" with a button \"Open Galaxy Wearable\" <- you need this button. Galaxy Wearable should open and show your Bluetooth connected watch. Start connecting.  \n8. **SKIP ALL THE STEPS OF LOGGING INTO YOUR SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE ACCOUNTS!!**! You can do it later.  \nP.S. Sometimes, during the setup process, everything might break at some percentage. Don't panic, and try again. I usually get it right on the second try.",

    "selftext": "Hello redditors!\n\nI have previously asked in this community if it's worth purchasing the Galaxy Watch 4 LTE 44mm refurbished for around 80$, and most people said I should I go search for an another model at around the same price. So while looking today, I found a lot of Galaxy Watch 7 40mm LTE listings for around 100$ - 120$. My question is if it's worth getting it for that price? One seller even said it's almost brand new, and it's been used for only 5 days, another said it's been rarely used. And for the price tag, plus the LTE feature, and being a relatively new flagship model (last year is was a flagship watch), I think it's worth to go for it. What do you guys think? Or should I get it, or should I go for Watch 6, 5, or an older model?\n\nMy question is if it's worth getting the Watch 7 LTE 40mm for this price tag? Is the battery relatively good, especially with LTE ON? Or does the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm or other older watches perform better? What about the experience, is it lag-free, what sensors does it have compared to older models, and why should I get it over an older model? And will it be any difference if using it with a Galaxy phone or not? And, jumping from a Galaxy Fit 3 to this watch would be a major difference? And if anything, how much does a battery swap cost?\n\nThanks in advance for helping me out!\n\n  \nEDIT 1: I forgot to mention, does this watch have comfortable straps and a comfortable design compared to older models?",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

It turns out the first-party straps from Samsung are just 22mm watch straps attached to a lug adapter.\n\n------\n\nBackstory: I had been using third-party strap adapter for this watch. I noticed a bit of flimsiness and a bit of clang as my arm moves. This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

Feeling disappointed, I realized I was misled by outdated information.\n\nNearby, I visited the Smart Telecom Center, where they introduced me to Device Link, their version of Globe One Number. They suggested I apply for a Smart postpaid plan and use Mobile Number Portability (MNP) to keep my Globe number.\n\nThe approval was quick. I went back to Globe to settle my balance, terminate my open-contract plan, and process the number transfer. Then I returned to Smart, where they immediately activated my postpaid and Device Link service.\n\nIt was a frustrating start with Globe, but everything went smoothly once I switched to Smart ‚Äî and now my watch works perfectly.",

Im not the only person that deals with this issue theres apparently thousands of people with same issue\n\n‚Äé3:36 PM\n\nI sincerely apologize for the significant inconvenience you are currently experiencing with your Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and the persistent Bluetooth connection issues. I completely understand your frustration, as it's clear that this problem is causing a disruption to your daily use of the device. Furthermore, I want to reassure you that we recognize this is not a result of any user error or improper setup on your part; rather, it is a known and widespread software issue affecting multiple users. Samsung has acknowledged this particular software problem, which is especially impacting some newer watch models, including the Watch 7 and Ultra series, and potentially other models that have recently undergone software updates. Rest assured that Samsung is actively working on developing and implementing a comprehensive solution to resolve this issue for all affected users, and we will keep you informed as soon as there's an update.\n\n‚Äé3:46 PM\n\nSamsung has officially stated that a Bluetooth connection error has been identified as a software issue and a patch is being developed and will be released soon.\n\n  \n**Wait for the Update**: The ultimate and most reliable fix will come directly from a software update from Samsung. You will be notified once it is available for download on your device.\n\n‚Äé3:51 PM\n\nWill we ever get an update to fix these watches??",

I'm curious to see what people have gotten in terms of a bedside wireless charging station I tried the two official ones from Samsung, one with a magnet the other one is just a pad and I didn't really like either of them. The magnetic stand doesn't charge overnight for some reason, and the pad I don't like how finicky alignment can be. I prefer something magnetic if possible but yeah I was wondering what everyone else has. I don't want to get one of those cheap Chinese knockoffs, I've had a bad experience without with my old iPhone, they would burn the cable.",

I just long pressed both buttons, and it displayed the logo and said rebooting, but just went blank afterward.

Is the battery replaceable and would I have to contact Samsung to get it replaced?\n\nDoes anyone know if the band is swappable with the Watch 7? I bought a Watch 7 earlier this year, but hated its super uncomfortable bulky tank tread band, so returned it. It also didn't offer me anything over the AW2 as I really only use the watch to see the time and answer phone calls (notifications are somewhat half-assed useless as I still have to tell it to display on my phone - especially FB notifications).",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter the speculation, the moment is finally here. Samsung has kicked off the global stable rollout of **One UI 8 Watch** for the **Galaxy Watch 7** series!\n\nIf you are outside the US/Korea, **check your app NOW!** Reports are flooding in from Europe, Asia, and other international markets that the update is live!\n\nFollowing up on our record-breaking previous posts (here's the last one:[Our previous release date post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1n5bs17/psa_one_ui_8_watch_wear_os_6_update_news_watch_7/)), this is the final official release update!\n\n\n\n# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\n\n* **Status:** Stable rollout is now expanding globally, which originally started in South korea and selected US users.\n* **Firmware:** The update is based on **Wear OS 6** \\- YES, FACER AND OTHER 3RD PARTY WATCH FACE APPS ARE AVAILABLE AGAIN!\n* **Size:** The package is substantial, typically around **1.9GB** to **2GB** for those upgrading from One UI 6 Watch. It's recommended to download over Wi-Fi.\n* **Firmware Version:** Look out for a build ending in **BYI4** (version number varies by region/carrier).\n\n***Here are the top 3 major revamps:***\n\n1. **The Now Bar:** This is the game-changer. It mirrors the phone experience by keeping live activities like music and timers accessible at the bottom of the screen.\n2. **Revamped UI & Tiles:** The interface is cleaner, and the new Multi-Info Tiles allow you to stack multiple widgets on one screen, solving the \"endless scrolling\" problem.\n3. **New Health Features:** Includes Bedtime Guidance for better sleep, Running Coach with personalized insights, and general performance/battery stability fixes.\n\n# Quick Note on Other Models:\n\n* **Watch 6 & 5 Series:** The public betas started on the samsung members app earlier this month.\n* **Watch 4 Series:** Your final major update is still on track for later this month/early November.\n\n**Go check your Galaxy Wearable App!**\n\nIf you've received the update, feel free to share pictures and comments of the update. From what I have seen, LTE models are being upgraded first, however since both models share the same components BT modes shouldn't be too far behind. Currently still waiting here in the UK at the time of posting this.\n\n  \n*p.s: this will be my last update post.*",

    "selftext": "I was discovering the features of the One UI 8 on the Galaxy Watch 7, and I expected that, given that they delayed the update for 3 months compared to the rest of the watches that support this feature, it would be supported so that they could wait for the new watches to be sold and then release them to the public, but wow. They didn't support it even though the Galaxy Watch 7's sensors are the same as those in the Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024. I don't see any reason for Samsung to restrict this feature from the Galaxy Watch 7. I really loved the One UI 8, but what ruined my experience was the lack of these two features. I was excited about them, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even if the readings of these features were inaccurate, at least they would have given me an idea. If I am wrong about anything, correct me and I will be grateful to you.",

It turns out the first-party straps from Samsung are just 22mm watch straps attached to a lug adapter.\n\n------\n\nBackstory: I had been using third-party strap adapter for this watch. I noticed a bit of flimsiness and a bit of clang as my arm moves. This made the watch feel unrefined.\n\nI tried using the official strap and found that the Dynamic Lug sits better, but I don't like the strap as much. I found that the official Dynamic Lug thing has rubber pads on the end, which is probably why it's not as flimsy and doesn't clang as much (as seen in picture 2).",

Feeling disappointed, I realized I was misled by outdated information.\n\nNearby, I visited the Smart Telecom Center, where they introduced me to Device Link, their version of Globe One Number. They suggested I apply for a Smart postpaid plan and use Mobile Number Portability (MNP) to keep my Globe number.\n\nThe approval was quick. I went back to Globe to settle my balance, terminate my open-contract plan, and process the number transfer. Then I returned to Smart, where they immediately activated my postpaid and Device Link service.\n\nIt was a frustrating start with Globe, but everything went smoothly once I switched to Smart ‚Äî and now my watch works perfectly.",

I'm curious to see what people have gotten in terms of a bedside wireless charging station I tried the two official ones from Samsung, one with a magnet the other one is just a pad and I didn't really like either of them. The magnetic stand doesn't charge overnight for some reason, and the pad I don't like how finicky alignment can be. I prefer something magnetic if possible but yeah I was wondering what everyone else has. I don't want to get one of those cheap Chinese knockoffs, I've had a bad experience without with my old iPhone, they would burn the cable.",

On the one hand I would prefer Acer for a bigger screen, more storage and also not less important the fact that it comes with charger and OEM Box, it has almost no scratches, almost new and a little bit less important it ships from Canada (I'm living there).\n\nOn the other hand the Dell as I know usually has a better quality construction, but there's not a lot of storage, it doesn't come with AC adapter and has some visible scratches, but it's still in pretty good condition. Some more powerful CPU, smaller screen and fingerprint. Comes from USA, that also means longer delivery but not so important.\n\nI need it for studying: Office 365 and some computing stuff, maybe decoding videos a little bit.\n\nThe fingerprint part I would says it's almost important for me like the webcam (I almost never use notebooks webcams, but it's still nice to have it for a future). I don't have a lot of money to spend. But I would like to do a clever choice.\n\nHope for your supportüôÇ",

I have been looking around and am leaning towards galaxy book4 pro / 360, but have seen some reviews on r/galaxybook saying that it has had a lot of issues. I need something that can run all necessary processes for a degree in criminology (so nothing like photoshop, video editing ect), normal media usage e.g. YouTube, Netflix, ect. And also playing light games like roblox and Minecraft is very important to me, as with my laptop rn I cannot play MC at all bc it lags so much, and roblox I have to play on lowest graphics and can't play fast-paced games. In an ideal world I'd like to play things like valorant and have it able to run steam and stuff without lagging, but mainly just MC and roblox lol. My budget is up to ¬£1,500 ish. Finally, I'd love it to stay within samsung ecosystem, if not then I am okay with anything except apple üòÖ and would like it to be a thin laptop so its not super heavy for me to carry around. If anybody can help with some recommendations, I would really appreciate it as I am rlly struggling rn lol\nThankyou sm! ",

It's for the laptop keyboard's ribbon cable, and it will get loose about every week (been happening for almost a month now) and I'll have to open the laptop and reseat it.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it seems to be an issue with the ZIF connecter not holding the ribbon cable tight enough, and slowly letting go of it as I move my laptop around (ex: I place my laptop down somewhere else, and the force of that moves the cable slightly). What happens is that my space bar, arrow keys, and a few letter random keys in the bottom row will work inconsistently. I've tested to make sure that this isn't some bizzare software bug, so it's definitely a hardware issue. The cable is also visually off, and the left side is loose. So, what should I do? Is there some way I can secure it without getting a whole new board? Could I remove the ZIF and then solder on a new one? Any help is appreciated!\n\n  \nEdit: here's a video for anyone wanting to see it in action\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4Q\\_zN\\_vuTWerDjq1FOBp3K\\_TWf-fk6s/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4Q_zN_vuTWerDjq1FOBp3K_TWf-fk6s/view?usp=drivesdk)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm dealing with a bizarre and incredibly frustrating issue with my Acer Nitro 5 (RTX 3060) and I'm hoping someone here has seen this before.\n\nThe problem is literally night and day depending on whether the laptop is plugged in or not. Here's the breakdown:\n\nScenario 1: Laptop UNPLUGGED (Everything is PERFECT)\n\n> Boot up on battery power.\n> NVIDIA GPU is detected instantly in Device Manager, Task Manaioger, and NitroSense.\n> Games run flawlessly, drivers are fine, no issues whatsoever.\n\nScenario 2: Laptop PLUGGED IN (Everything breaks)\n\n> If I boot with the charger already plugged in: Windows doesn't see the GPU at all.\n  > Task Manager only shows integrated graphics.\n  > NVIDIA Control Panel says \"No NVIDIA GPU is detected.\"\n  > In Device Manager, the RTX 3060 is missing. If I \"Show hidden devices,\" it appears grayed out with Error Code 45: \"This device is not connected to the computer.\"\n> If I plug the charger in while the laptop is running: Games instantly crash and the entire system becomes laggy and unresponsive until I unplug it.\n\nMy Theory is, next. \nIt seems like the moment the charger is connected,the GPU is virtually \"disconnected\" from the system.\nI suspect a hardware/power delivery issue. Maybe the motherboard is shutting down the GPU to protect it from a power surge or a voltage irregularity coming from the charger or the DC-in port.\n\nThe Crucial Clue:\nThis problem started immediately after I used the laptop on battery power for about an hour at university. \nAs many other Nitro 5 users have experienced, draining the battery or using it unplugged can sometimes trigger weird performance and power-related bugs (I know there are workarounds for the performance throttling, but this seems different and more severe).\n\nWhat I've Concluded So Far:\n\n1. The GPU itself and its drivers are 100% fine. They work perfectly on battery power.\n2. The issue is almost certainly tied to the power state when the AC adapter is connected, pointing towards a potential hardware fault.\n\nMy Questions for You:\n\n> Hardware or Software? Is this a known Acer Nitro shenanigan with a fix I'm missing, or is my gut feeling about a hardware failure correct?\n> What's the most likely culprit? The AC adapter itself? The DC-in jack on the motherboard? The battery? The motherboard's power delivery system?\n> Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Any diagnostic steps or solutions would be a lifesaver.\n\nEverything helps, thank you!",

Will this setup still work on the MacBook?\n\nPlease note: I'm not very techie.

    "selftext": "Hi, I have to replace my (very) old laptop since it only supports extralightweight Linux distros and basically cannot handle much multimedia post-processing (my most CPU-intensive tasks are editing audio and pictures) and even browsing internet is not that snappy despite all the optimizations to reduce RAM usage, CPU is definitely the main bottleneck there.\n\nI'm thinking of getting a used laptop, and I came across a few that seemed interesting to me, they're all below US$100, use any of these CPUs (i5-5200U, i5-3340M, i5-7200U).\n\nI'd like something that will last as long as possible and be somewhat future-resistant (not becoming useless in 5 years or less).\n\n1. Should I aim for a used laptop which passed MIL-STD 810H or similar mil-spec tests, meaning that normal use would be a breeze for it and hence possibly last longer and being more likely to have survived past owner's non-visible misuse?\n\n2. If CPU performances are similar, should I aim for a laptop which is 2 generations newer, just for the sake of it having likely more time ahead?\n\n3. Should I aim for a model which can support the highest amount of RAM, so that I can max out the RAM to postpone as late as possible the day when it will be too obsolete?\n\n4. Are there any hidden physical or software trackers I should be wary of that cannot be removed by formatting, if buying a used laptop?\n\nThanks for your help",

    "selftext": "I consider myself pretty tech savvy and this is putting me at a lost for words. My storage/disc drive is CONSTANTLY telling me its full... when there's literally barely anything on my laptop. I use it occasionally for work stuff, but primarly to play an online game (Wiz101 show in pic #4). While the game does use a lot of storage, i know it should not be taking up all of my storage. I played this game as a kid on a laptop much older and much worse than the one i have now.\n\nWhat's causing my confusion/frustration:\n\n* The system shows the game is using 0 storage? which obviously cannot be true.\n   * It should only be taking up 15-20gb ish according the the game site.\n* \"System & Reserve\" is taking up literally have of the disc drive, while it is currently telling me it needs to install more updates.  There is no way, that i see, to edit what is being saved. This seems ridiculous and honestly like a marketing ploy to purposely take up storage forcing you to buy more.\n* I added up all the values for \"installed apps\" and it only comes to 1.063 GB ... not 28.4\n* There's literally nothing else on the computer besides what comes preprogrammed/installed. No files, no pictures, recycle bin empty, no audio. Literally just the game and windows system files.\n\nI have tried:\n\n* Running through the game log and clearing temp files and unneeded files.\n* Running Disc Cleanup\n\nnot sure what else to do and i don't currently have an external storage device to use.",

    "selftext": "Hi there. Here's a preface before I use the suggestion form; my laptop's screen just shorted on the board but it works well with external monitors. I bring my laptop around for school and I use it at home. Most attachable external monitors I've found go to the side or above the main monitor, but I'd like to use one that goes over the top of my main monitor so I can ignore the dead one and not have to look in any awkward direction. I have an ASUS ROG Strix (G15, IIRC).\nSee rough illustration for what I'm looking for in a visual sense, as I'm worried I'm not explaining it well.\n\n\n\n    Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:\n\n    Purchasing in US, would like to spend under 200 dollars. Preferably in the 80-150 range.\n\n    Are you open to refurbs/used?\n\n    If necessary.\n\n    How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?\n\n    N/A\n\n    How important is weight and thinness to you?\n\n    I'd prefer something thin so I can fit it in my backpack with my laptop.\n\n    Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\n\n     I believe my screen's size is 15.6 in? It could be 16. I need to check.\n\n    Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\n\n    I often draw on Krita with an external tablet and would enjoy if I could use multiple external displays at once with it. I sometimes use my All-in-one USB-C for my drawing tablet, but I'm willing to use my HDMI and power cords for it instead if it comes to that, since I usually use that one at home anyways. I'd like the option to use both HMDI + a power cable and the option to use an all-in-one USB-C, if possible.\n\n    If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\n\n    -fill here, remove dashes-\n\n    Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\n\n    Needs to overlap the screen, preferably be durable, and it'd be nice if I could clip it so it stays firm?\n\n    Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\n\n    N/A, thank you so much for reading and taking the time to suggest!\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI‚Äôve been troubleshooting my HP Omen 17-cb0040nr (2019, i7-9750H + RTX 2070 + 144 Hz G-Sync panel) for years, and it‚Äôs finally reaching a weird, half-alive state. Here‚Äôs the full story in chronological order.\n\nüïê 2019 ‚Äì Early 2020\n\nLaptop worked great for the first ~6 months.\n\nHeavy gaming (Apex Legends, etc.) pushed GPU temps to 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C.\n\nThe display would suddenly go black, sound would freeze, and I had to force shutdown.\n\nAfter cooling down, it would boot normally again.\n\nLag when plugged in: Occasionally, since purchase, performance would drop badly until I unplugged and re-plugged the charger, then FPS would instantly recover.\n\nüßπ Mid 2020 ‚Äì 2021\n\nFound dust clogging the cooling system; cleaned it thoroughly.\n\nTemps improved and random shutdowns reduced.\n\nAround 2021, HP UEFI Diagnostics flagged a ‚ÄúVideo Memory [F] failure‚Äù ‚Üí confirmed early VRAM instability on the GPU.\n\nFrom this point onward, the GPU remained functional but unstable under high load.\n\n‚ö° 2022 ‚Äì 2024\n\nContinued gaming on medium settings; GPU stayed below 78 ¬∞C.\n\nOccasional driver crashes or screen flickers.\n\nNo major shutdowns, but instability kept creeping back.\n\nüîã 2025\n\nHP Smart reported a ‚Äúblown charge-state fuse‚Äù ‚Äî battery stopped charging completely. Removed the battery since this. I get CMOS error and I press enter to see boot (hp omen logo).\n\nBegan using the laptop plugged in only, like a desktop.\n\nThe power button started blinking continuously even during normal operation ‚Üí likely due to the battery-circuit fault.\n\nSystem still booted and worked fine on AC.\n\nüí• Current State (2025 October)\n\nThe internal laptop display stays black most of the time (backlight faintly glows).\n\nExternal 200 Hz monitor (HDMI) works well ‚Äî I can even play Apex Legends for hours on medium settings with GPU VRAM capped to 4 GB.\n\n\nNVIDIA Control Panel won‚Äôt open, though the RTX 2070 is visible in Device Manager and Task Manager.\n\nBoot behavior:\n\nExternal monitor connected via HDMI.\n\nPress power ‚Üí CMOS error occurs(sometimes it wont be displayed in either of the displays, occurs when I start the laptop after a long time, like half a day etc) (I press enter to proceed with booting, as one can see if windows is booted or not by pressing caps lock to see if the button lights are working or not) \n\nWhat happens next in a successful boot is, the powee button light goes off and turns on in like 2 sec, I press entee agan and the same cycle happens for one more time (2 to 3 timez at max), and then the external display connected (sometimes internal display too) gets hp omen logo boot screen. Post this, if windows login acreen comes, in atleast one of the displays, it is a successful boot. Else, I have to force shutdown the pc and start again\n\nSystem reboots itself once or twice.\n\nHP Omen logo appears ‚Äî almost always on the external monitor.\n\nDisplay outcomes (approx. 10 boots):\n\n5 times ‚Üí only external monitor shows the Windows login screen, laptop panel stays blank.\n\n1 time ‚Üí both monitors work correctly and internal 144 Hz panel shows Windows login.\n\n4 times ‚Üí internal panel = black, external = HP logo only (no Windows output). I can still log in blindly and shut down via Alt + F4, so the system is running headless.\n\nWhen I try to ‚ÄúDuplicate display,‚Äù both displays drop to 1024√ó768 @ 60 Hz, the only modes Windows detects for the laptop screen.\n\nüîé Current Symptoms Summary\n\nGPU and HDMI output work reliably; internal panel almost dead.\n\nCMOS error on every cold boot ‚Üí BIOS resets device detection.\n\nHP Diagnostics previously confirmed Video Memory failure.\n\nüí≠ My Suspicions\n\nPartial GPU VRAM degradation or faulty eDP (output to internal panel).\n\nPossible loose or damaged eDP cable/panel connector.\n\nWeak CMOS battery causing repeated re-detection and boot loops.\n\nBattery-charging fuse blown (confirmed), forcing AC-only operation.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What Still Works\n\nExternal monitor gaming at 200 Hz for hours.\n\nAll USB, audio, and Ethernet functions.\n\nInternal panel sometimes returns to life for one boot, then fails again.\n\n‚ùìLooking for Advice\n\nHas anyone seen an RTX-series GPU that works fine externally but fails internally?\n\nCould a failing VRAM or eDP transmitter cause intermittent CMOS errors?\n\nIs a GPU reball worth it on this board (L50873-006), or should I hunt for a replacement motherboard?\n\nAny way to disable the internal panel entirely to speed up boot?\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would really help.\nThanks for reading ‚Äî posting this so future Omen owners facing half-dead GPUs can find a full timeline too.",

I have an Android phone.\n* I store my files on both Google Drive and OneDrive (and don't really store things locally, but I use the sync apps).\n\nI'm drawn to the MacBook Air due to it's battery life and reliability. But I'm drawn to the Surface due to it's familiarity and customisability. There are a few Windows features I use regularly, and I don't know if I could give them up:\n\n* Ability to copy and paste file paths in Explorer.\n* Snipping Tool.\n* The task bar (each window having it's own icon, being able to hover over the icons and see previews).\n* Easily snapping windows on the screen using keyboard shortcuts.\n* Centre clicking the scroll wheel to close tabs/open links.\n\n**So, what do you think? I'm thinking Surface Laptop, but I'm worried about longevity (mostly battery life).**\n\nThankyou!",

After I gave it to the repair shop they started taking too long and when I asked for updates they said they needed to import some pieces and that's what was taking too long. Unbeknownst to me during these weeks they went on a minor holiday, despite the fact I told them I had a thesis to write and that in the meantime they could give me back my laptop temporarily. Fed up with the waiting, I demanded that to be returned, only for them to disassemble it the same morning I came back to take it and asking me for one more day. After one day I took it back and now it doesn't start anymore, the BIOS doesn't start, and Windows recovery USB doesn't work either. I looked inside but nothing has been stolen. What could have they done with it?(They asked for my password) How can I at least salvage the situation?",

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** 15 000czk, Czech Republic\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** I'd prefer new\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** long lasting battery would be awesome for school, however, I'd probably use it more for gaming. I usually play Minecraft or Roblox, and my current laptop has problems even with loading Opera... So I prioritise performance over battery life \n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** It doesn't need to be macbook level thin, but I'd appreciate it fitting in my backpack\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** none\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Id love for it to run Minecraft at at least 60 fps, I also use Krita and handle big files there, and i use Opera for my browser.  \n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Minecraft, 60fps at least\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** none\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** none",

    "selftext": "So as the title implies, for some reason GHelper thinks HDR is active, even though my system doesn't even support it (Asus ROG Strix G18 (2024)). On top of that, I'm getting an issue commonly experienced when HDR is, in fact, on; my cursor is overexposed (washed out, light colors), except when dragging windows. First I thought it was Nvidia's fault since it only occurred when I was on the NVIDIA GPU only display mode, but after another restart it started happening when I'm on Optimus as well...\n\nThis led me to think that something is tricking my system into thinking it's using HDR, but I can't for the life of me figure out what that something is. I've checked everything that comes to mind, both Nvidia's settings and my Windows settings. In Windows settings it is clearly stated that only HDR Video is supported, but \"Use HDR\" isn't. In the Nvidia settings the only HDR-related setting that I can find is HDR under RTX Video Enhancement, but whether I turn it on or off does not make any difference.\n\nIf anyone knows how to handle this, I'd be pleased to receive feedback.",

It was constant pain. It's got lots of great memories but I think I have to let go already. But to let go means to get a new one. The problem is: I don't have money. To be in a country like mine and being a broke teenager, it's almost impossible to save up money fast enough to still get my school work done. Right now I'm mostly borrowing my mother's laptop and it's just not consistent because she needs it for her work too and our schedule lines up and I end up never being able to use it.

There is no way, that i see, to edit what is being saved. This seems ridiculous and honestly like a marketing ploy to purposely take up storage forcing you to buy more.\n* I added up all the values for \"installed apps\" and it only comes to 1.063 GB ... not 28.4\n* There's literally nothing else on the computer besides what comes preprogrammed/installed.

[Dell Latitude 5420](https://www.dell.com/support/product-details/en-us/servicetag/0-UjBZQXkyQnJSQ0RYanE3WUNkK1hNZz090/overview) (7029CF3)\n\nThere's a specs brief:\n**Dell**\n**186 Canada dollars**\n**14\"** Anti-glare/Non Touch (FHD)\n**i5-1145G7**\n16GB (2x8)\nIris Xe graphics\n**256** GB NVMe\nNo webcam\nFingerprint\n\n**Acer**\n**260 Canada dollars**\n**15.6\"** ComfyView (FHD)\n**i5-1135G7**\n16GB (2x8)\nIris Xe graphics\n**1TB** GB NVMe\nYes webcam\nNo fingerprint\n\nSo, both notebooks looks solid for me. On the one hand I would prefer Acer for a bigger screen, more storage and also not less important the fact that it comes with charger and OEM Box, it has almost no scratches, almost new and a little bit less important it ships from Canada (I'm living there).\n\nOn the other hand the Dell as I know usually has a better quality construction, but there's not a lot of storage, it doesn't come with AC adapter and has some visible scratches, but it's still in pretty good condition. Some more powerful CPU, smaller screen and fingerprint. Comes from USA, that also means longer delivery but not so important.\n\nI need it for studying: Office 365 and some computing stuff, maybe decoding videos a little bit.\n\nThe fingerprint part I would says it's almost important for me like the webcam (I almost never use notebooks webcams, but it's still nice to have it for a future). I don't have a lot of money to spend. But I would like to do a clever choice.\n\nHope for your supportüôÇ",

Should I aim for a used laptop which passed MIL-STD 810H or similar mil-spec tests, meaning that normal use would be a breeze for it and hence possibly last longer and being more likely to have survived past owner's non-visible misuse?\n\n2. If CPU performances are similar, should I aim for a laptop which is 2 generations newer, just for the sake of it having likely more time ahead?\n\n3. Should I aim for a model which can support the highest amount of RAM, so that I can max out the RAM to postpone as late as possible the day when it will be too obsolete?\n\n4.

    "selftext": "Hi! This is my first post on reddit. I will be going to uni next year and am in desperate need for a good laptop. Mine rn is a HP Intel core 4 and it is soooo bad.. I have been looking around and am leaning towards galaxy book4 pro / 360, but have seen some reviews on r/galaxybook saying that it has had a lot of issues. I need something that can run all necessary processes for a degree in criminology (so nothing like photoshop, video editing ect), normal media usage e.g. YouTube, Netflix, ect. And also playing light games like roblox and Minecraft is very important to me, as with my laptop rn I cannot play MC at all bc it lags so much, and roblox I have to play on lowest graphics and can't play fast-paced games. In an ideal world I'd like to play things like valorant and have it able to run steam and stuff without lagging, but mainly just MC and roblox lol. My budget is up to ¬£1,500 ish. Finally, I'd love it to stay within samsung ecosystem, if not then I am okay with anything except apple üòÖ and would like it to be a thin laptop so its not super heavy for me to carry around. If anybody can help with some recommendations, I would really appreciate it as I am rlly struggling rn lol\nThankyou sm! ",

    "selftext": "Hey y'all. As stated in the title, I've been dealing with a loose ZIF Connector in my laptop that's driving my crazy. It's for the laptop keyboard's ribbon cable, and it will get loose about every week (been happening for almost a month now) and I'll have to open the laptop and reseat it.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it seems to be an issue with the ZIF connecter not holding the ribbon cable tight enough, and slowly letting go of it as I move my laptop around (ex: I place my laptop down somewhere else, and the force of that moves the cable slightly). What happens is that my space bar, arrow keys, and a few letter random keys in the bottom row will work inconsistently. I've tested to make sure that this isn't some bizzare software bug, so it's definitely a hardware issue. The cable is also visually off, and the left side is loose. So, what should I do? Is there some way I can secure it without getting a whole new board? Could I remove the ZIF and then solder on a new one? Any help is appreciated!\n\n  \nEdit: here's a video for anyone wanting to see it in action\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4Q\\_zN\\_vuTWerDjq1FOBp3K\\_TWf-fk6s/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4Q_zN_vuTWerDjq1FOBp3K_TWf-fk6s/view?usp=drivesdk)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm dealing with a bizarre and incredibly frustrating issue with my Acer Nitro 5 (RTX 3060) and I'm hoping someone here has seen this before.\n\nThe problem is literally night and day depending on whether the laptop is plugged in or not. Here's the breakdown:\n\nScenario 1: Laptop UNPLUGGED (Everything is PERFECT)\n\n> Boot up on battery power.\n> NVIDIA GPU is detected instantly in Device Manager, Task Manaioger, and NitroSense.\n> Games run flawlessly, drivers are fine, no issues whatsoever.\n\nScenario 2: Laptop PLUGGED IN (Everything breaks)\n\n> If I boot with the charger already plugged in: Windows doesn't see the GPU at all.\n  > Task Manager only shows integrated graphics.\n  > NVIDIA Control Panel says \"No NVIDIA GPU is detected.\"\n  > In Device Manager, the RTX 3060 is missing. If I \"Show hidden devices,\" it appears grayed out with Error Code 45: \"This device is not connected to the computer.\"\n> If I plug the charger in while the laptop is running: Games instantly crash and the entire system becomes laggy and unresponsive until I unplug it.\n\nMy Theory is, next. \nIt seems like the moment the charger is connected,the GPU is virtually \"disconnected\" from the system.\nI suspect a hardware/power delivery issue. Maybe the motherboard is shutting down the GPU to protect it from a power surge or a voltage irregularity coming from the charger or the DC-in port.\n\nThe Crucial Clue:\nThis problem started immediately after I used the laptop on battery power for about an hour at university. \nAs many other Nitro 5 users have experienced, draining the battery or using it unplugged can sometimes trigger weird performance and power-related bugs (I know there are workarounds for the performance throttling, but this seems different and more severe).\n\nWhat I've Concluded So Far:\n\n1. The GPU itself and its drivers are 100% fine. They work perfectly on battery power.\n2. The issue is almost certainly tied to the power state when the AC adapter is connected, pointing towards a potential hardware fault.\n\nMy Questions for You:\n\n> Hardware or Software? Is this a known Acer Nitro shenanigan with a fix I'm missing, or is my gut feeling about a hardware failure correct?\n> What's the most likely culprit? The AC adapter itself? The DC-in jack on the motherboard? The battery? The motherboard's power delivery system?\n> Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Any diagnostic steps or solutions would be a lifesaver.\n\nEverything helps, thank you!",

I only opened this up again since I need a laptop for school this yr and when I did, I was reminded of why I hated this thing. It's slow, laggy, and didn't even do me well over the yrs. It was constant pain. It's got lots of great memories but I think I have to let go already. But to let go means to get a new one. The problem is: I don't have money. To be in a country like mine and being a broke teenager, it's almost impossible to save up money fast enough to still get my school work done. Right now I'm mostly borrowing my mother's laptop and it's just not consistent because she needs it for her work too and our schedule lines up and I end up never being able to use it. Anyways my whish for this Christmas is a new laptop so I could do my school work and possibly have an online job.",

My storage/disc drive is CONSTANTLY telling me its full... when there's literally barely anything on my laptop. I use it occasionally for work stuff, but primarly to play an online game (Wiz101 show in pic #4). While the game does use a lot of storage, i know it should not be taking up all of my storage. I played this game as a kid on a laptop much older and much worse than the one i have now.\n\nWhat's causing my confusion/frustration:\n\n* The system shows the game is using 0 storage? which obviously cannot be true.\n   * It should only be taking up 15-20gb ish according the the game site.\n* \"System & Reserve\" is taking up literally have of the disc drive, while it is currently telling me it needs to install more updates.  There is no way, that i see, to edit what is being saved. This seems ridiculous and honestly like a marketing ploy to purposely take up storage forcing you to buy more.\n* I added up all the values for \"installed apps\" and it only comes to 1.063 GB ... not 28.4\n* There's literally nothing else on the computer besides what comes preprogrammed/installed. No files, no pictures, recycle bin empty, no audio. Literally just the game and windows system files.\n\nI have tried:\n\n* Running through the game log and clearing temp files and unneeded files.\n* Running Disc Cleanup\n\nnot sure what else to do and i don't currently have an external storage device to use.",

On the one hand I would prefer Acer for a bigger screen, more storage and also not less important the fact that it comes with charger and OEM Box, it has almost no scratches, almost new and a little bit less important it ships from Canada (I'm living there).\n\nOn the other hand the Dell as I know usually has a better quality construction, but there's not a lot of storage, it doesn't come with AC adapter and has some visible scratches, but it's still in pretty good condition. Some more powerful CPU, smaller screen and fingerprint. Comes from USA, that also means longer delivery but not so important.\n\nI need it for studying: Office 365 and some computing stuff, maybe decoding videos a little bit.\n\nThe fingerprint part I would says it's almost important for me like the webcam (I almost never use notebooks webcams, but it's still nice to have it for a future). I don't have a lot of money to spend. But I would like to do a clever choice.\n\nHope for your supportüôÇ",

After turning my PC on, everything seemed to run fine and ran stress tests which kept temps right and no problems. \n\nFor whatever reason, running CS2 though, now puts my GPU to 90-100% on the performance monitor (still at ~82 degrees) and sometimes both my monitors go black and I have to restart my PC to get any image back on screen. (I‚Äôm running at recommended settings, which is high but nothing crazy and much lower than a 3070 should be able to handle). It seems like this only stops if I turn settings WAY down.\n\nI have EXTENSIVELY checked all my power wires to motherboard, cpu, gpu and drives (both ends, fully modular PSU). I also reseated my GPU, and frankly RAM just to check but still not finding anything. \n\nAnyone got any ideas? ",

I was only able to get it to work once randomly on a back USB 3.2 Gen 1 port.\n\nIt seems to only be consistently working via a USB 2.0 hub. Have a back 3.2 Gen 1 port connected to a powered hub - worked on that.

I'm assuming, with XHCI disabled, all ports will work at USB 2.0 speeds - is it possible to force it for a particular port / ports?",

    "title": "Upgrading my pc, 9800x3d vs 7800x3d, or maybe even 7600x3d?  whats my best bang for the buck here?",
    "selftext": "This season I plan to give my computer some love and get a little upgrade.  I dont super need to, performance is still fine, but its been a while and ive got an itch to, so its my present to myself this year.  I upgraded a few years ago, like 2022 i think, but the centerpiece then was my gpu.  I simultaneously hit the tail end of gpu shortage prices, while also jsut missing the launch of the radeon 7000 series, double wammy but my 6900xt has served me well and Im happy.  And my prior gpu had been a little 1650 super, so a monumental leap in performance.  But I digress this time around I am looking to upgrade my cpu, and finally move off the am4 socket.\n\nCurrent specs:\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600x\n\n32 GB ram\n\nAMD radeon 6900xt\n\n3440x1440 165hz Ultra wide monitor (Asus TUF VG34VQL1B)\n\nMy computer is mostly a gaming machine, but I do some p\\[productivity tasks, notably 3d modeling with Autodesk Fusion.  I play a small variety of games, nothing esports competitive, nothing that I really need the bleeding edge maximum fps, minimum graphic setting 1080p monitor cranking 600 fps.  Mostly Tarkov, war thunder, playing through borderlands 4 with buddies, will pick up battlefield 6 when it eventually hits a decent sale, heavily modded mincraft.  I dont need the absolute best of the best cpu, I hoenstly dont really do anything to really warrant it, but some use cases will benefit from it, and if Im spending the money on a new fancy cpu, I want it to have the new fancy kid on the block with the x3d cache.  And truth be told, my gpu wouldnt nearly push a 9800x3d, but eventually I will upgrade my gpu, in another couple years or so, and I'd hate for it to be held back cause i skimped on CPU now.  And I do know the performance difference between the 7800 and 9800 tends to blurr a bit when you leave optimum 1080p specs, so my ultra wide is kinda muddying the water a bit.\n\nSo I request the consensus on the best option.  I will most likely be buying a motherboard cpu combo from micro center unless a better deal is found elsewhere, im not opposed the open box shelves if they got better prices.  I will be sticking with the B-series motherboards as I do not need any of the fanciness the X-series has, despite how pretty they are.  I will be getting at least 32gb of ram to go with, though I saw some decent deals when researching earlier and may splurge on 64 for the heck of it if the price is right.  Ive seen some other threads discussing similar topics and the price difference was like $200 or more between the 7800 and 9800, and for that range the performance difference would be negligible enough for me to just save the money, but currently the gap is more like $80 and at the range its more tempting, so i ask is it worth it for the 9800x3d?  \n\nOr for conversation sake anynone rooting for the 7600x3d?  Its significantly cheaper being $120/200 cheaper than the 7800/9800x3d.  But I can find very few reviews for the seemingly micro center exclusive processor, so I havent really been able to give it a proper comparison to the others, what kinda performace would I be missing out on going with the super budget friendly option.\n\nNow lets be clear, I can afford the full fat 9800x3d, so budget isnt really the conversation here, but if the performance just isnt there to be worth it I will happily save my money, or better yet put it towards the ram splurge, or a new ssd.  I would just like to here some opinions on the best plan here.  Or maybe even none at all, I havent really been keeping up with tech news in a while, so I literally dont know whats on the horizon, is there a new release, or a refresh coming up that I should wait on?  Either to get the new fancy thing or jsut hit the deals form the stuff being retired?\n\nAnd lastly, for those who I know will be here completely ignoring the topic of I want to upgrade my cpu and not my gpu, I will ask you this, my budget for all this is around $800.  If I didnt buy literally any of what I just talked about and put it all in my gpu, what do you recommend?",

Was thinking i could easily put a couple/few hundred in with no major issues as i wont really miss it (so budget upto about 1k AUD), and going a cheaper board, like the tomahawk, yields about a 100 excess in my account ‚Äì which will be gone next time i buy a couple items at the supermarket, so not really worth going a little cheaper to save money.\n\nNow, was initially I was thinking of going the MSI (perhaps carbon) seeing as they seem stable, however, thinking as i have an asus 7900xtx, if i get an asus board, all the flashy lights will synchronize, and that would be kinda cool.\n\nso an x870e-e gaming may be my best bet, which ive been waiting on a awesome special on (will probably wait until black Friday/cyber monday sales, and hopefully trade off less than 100 to get a better board ‚Äì given i am waiting on the AMD RMA, and for amazon to issue the refund anyways, there is no major rush.)\n\nHOWEVER, and here is the part that i came to you experts for...\n\nGiven the only thing i really set on my nova was the expo for the 6000 ram (though that said, this was due to it being unstable), The asus board could be overkill ‚Äì though i love the idea of an AI overclock doing all the work for me. (and, as i said, getting a slightly cheaper board saving 100 wouldn't really affect us) BUT, I could look into something like the \"Gigabyte AM5 ATX B650 EAGLE AX DDR5 Motherboard\" which is above just 200 bux AUD, which in turn would net me 400 dollar savings, over the refund of the nova x860e.\n\nI love the idea of the pcie 5 ‚Äì however 4 would do me, as the 7900xtx wouldn't be toooo throttled by it,  \ni love the idea of 4-5 nvme, but i only have 2 and a single 4TB ssd, so would have enough room for more drives, one is even a 5.0 slot on the gigabyte.  \nI love the idea of usb 4.0 but dont really have a need for it at the moment. would be good to future proof. considering this only has 3.2 gen 1. (not even gen 2)  \nI love the idea of wifi 7, though my house only has wifi 6.  \nI love the idea of multi gigabit network given im hoping to plug my server into a 10gb uplink, (but the switch is only gb anyways ‚Äì and im not looking to drop 700 on a multi gb switch)\n\n(rest of system  \nRAM: SP Silicon Power XPOWER Pulse 64GB (2x32GB) DDR5 6000MHz  \npower supply RM1000x shift.  \ncase nzxt h9 flow (supports 3.2 gen 2)  \ncooler: nzxt kraken elite 360  \nboot disk: kingston fury renegade  \nsecondary nvme lexam 790nm  \nevo 970 4TB sata  \ncpu 9800x3d  \nmonitor: Samsung 57 inch g95nc)\n\nso currently the B650 would suit my needs, and Id get a 400 refund, which would be nice, but not essential, (probably wouldn't be too missed)  \nbut i can easily afford to drop a couple hundred more on a better board as well.\n\nat the same time, i hate waste.\n\nwhat are everyone's thoughts in regards to what way i should go, as i said, give or take 1-200 bux isnt going to make or break us.\n\n400 hundred would be nice (and considering id be spending another 200 ‚Äì its closer to 600 saved)\n\nhowever, i love gadgets and tech, can afford the nicer board without really caring about the extra cash, and considering the rest of my system is fairly peek, is it just a kick in the guts to get a cheap motherboard? or will it really not make much of a difference in my use case.\n\nb650 may suit my needs  \nx870e would future proof it and i'd be able to put the next gen CPU in it anyways.

The factors I'm considering:\n\n9070:  \n\\- Pros: better performance than 5070. I would've picked 9070XT but I'm trying to buy from amazon to maximize savings and they don't have a near MSRP model yet. I'd rather have a gpu ordered in the next few weeks and then return it if a better deal comes out closer to black friday, as I need my pc ready by December for school and can't afford my top option selling out closer to that date.

I can get one for MSRP at micro center but it's $70 more (no cashback), and the limited return window messes up my plan above, plus I can't return it easily.\n\n\\- Cons: not much other than price and potential lack of new software features after next generation?\n\n5070:\n\nPros: cheaper, plus Nvidia tends to be better about supporting older cards over the years, like bringing the newer DLSS features to older gpus, while AMD isn't officially supporting the 7000 series/older w/ FSR 4 features. Nvidia's CUDA cores are still better for most productivity work, since I also need to be able to run certain coding emulators/OS (stuff that drains my macbook battery insanely fast). Path tracing is better too, but I don't care about that too much.\n\nCons: 12gb of VRAM...\n\n9060XT:\n\nPros: 16gb of VRAM, cheaper than all other options, still good in 1440p.\n\nCons: All the benchmarks I've seen show it heavily relying on FG, FSR in all the new games I want to play and I've always preferred raw performance.\n\nI know the 9070 is better in raw performance than the 5070, but is it worth the extra $50 and worse productivity/support? I always see people saying it's better value at their same price MSRP, but when it's more expensive does that value still hold up? And on top of that are both the 5070 and 9070 worth the extra $130 and $190 over the 9060 XT? \n\nAppreciate any advice.",

    "title": "Looking for advice to learn better cpu/gpu matches on new build",
    "selftext": "Background: I'm getting ready to put my new pc together that will run on Linux (mint?) OS . I chose to go for a mini-itx build bc of the portability and space. If this info helps, I imagine using it primarily to learn programming, game dev, gaming, and possibly picking up music production (very beginner hobbyist) - which is not very different from what I do now. \n\nContext on my questions: About a week ago I picked up my order at my local microcenter. The guy at the pick up area handed me my order and made a couple of comments about the parts I chose and didn't quite understand what he meant. (I could've asked to elaborate but I was on a time crunch.) He said something about my cpu (or gpu) along the lines of \"wasted Gs\" and something about the integrated graphics. \n\nMy questions: I wanted to know if you happen to know what he meant? How can I learn more about that? How can I determine what is a suitable gpu for my cpu (and/or vice versa) - I look at the specs to make sure they fit and compare between parts and choose what O think is best for my needs. What parts would you swap for a more optimal/compatible matchup if that makes sense? I can always upgrade one part or the other later, right? \n\nI didnt know what he meant, and I wish I had time to chat w him about it. I'm genuinely curious and want to learn more. This is my second time building a pc. If any one can give me advice or tips, I'd greatly appreciate it. \n\n\nAnd to help w knowing what parts were involved, here it is:\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G Phoenix AM5 4.2GHz 8-Core, \nGigabyte B850I AORUS PRO AMD AM5 Mini-ITX Motherboard, \nMSI NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 SHADOW 2X Overclocked, \nG.Skill Trident Z5 RGB Series 64GB 2 x 32GB) DDR5-6000, \nSamsung 990 EVO Plus 1TB Samsung V NAND TLC NAND, abd\nASUS ROG Loki 850 Watt 80 Plus Platinum SFX-L\n\n\nSo far from what I gathered, the Ryzen 7 cpu is limiting the ryx 5070 and I should either upgrade my cpu or downgrade my gpu. \n",

I've used TigerDirect (I'm in Canada) in the past to get compatible parts and stuff but now that place no longer exist. \n\n  \nMy budget is $2000 CAD and looking to build a PC that's very video friendly. Basically my parents have the PC hooked up to their living room 70'' TV to do most of their PC entertainment. It's mostly heavy video watching (4K movies and shows) that they download off of the internet, and casual web browsing. They have a home theatre system hooked up to the HDMI cable for audio. Wireless internet is not a must as the modem's in the living room. \n\n  \nSo long story short, while they don't game, i'm thinking of building something that's very future-proof for high quality videos they'll watch in the future.

Preferably would like to upgrade to the 5700x3d but its harder to find cheaper than $300. I see the 5800xt is at $180 and was wondering if that was a substantial enough upgrade to hold off for a year or two or would it be too little of a performance gain for that pricepoint.",

    "selftext": "Installing windows 11 was giving me error 0xc0000098 on two different motherboards, the final with a blue screen saying \"Your PC/Device needs to be repaired\"   \nfile: windows/system32/ntoskrnl.exe\n\nThis was during install from a USB device that I purchased from NewEgg.   \nTroubleshooting one board led to being told a bevy of different things, and even Microsoft in the end wasn't who solved it. \n\n If you are running into the ntoskrnl.exe issue, try the following: \n\n1. Turn off secure boot\n2. Use just one stick of RAM\n3. Force boot from BIOS\n\nI assume a lot of people have run into this.\n\nDon't buy ASUS boards. If you have an issue basic support can't handle, they will not get back to you. Went MSI in the end. Not that I needed their support but I could at least install there without having to flash a bios, which I'm convinced is what actually was wrong in the end of my last escapade. ASUS' instructions were bad, and couldn't react to what I was telling them was happening.\n\nSo glad the video card I bought jic there was an issue with the former can go right back to NewEgg. STUPID that the phrasing is that your computer needs repaired when really there was nothing wrong at all. Micro$oft needs to get their act together and make these messages more helpful, while making this OS more ready for a variety of builds and options. \n\nno discussion needed, but I will answer questions if I can. Here just for records and ye olde Google index. \n\nThe completed build is as follows:  \nAMD Ryzen 5 5500  \nCorsair DDR4 3200 32GB (16x2)  \nRTX2060 (mostly because I had it laying around and it has 3 monitor support)  \nMSI MAG B550 Gaming Plus\n\ngonna last me a while for work, knocking on wood.

My case comes with a bridge that lets the GPU sit vertically while connecting to the motherboard.\n\n4. Checked the power cable to make sure the GPU was getting enough power.\n\n5. Made sure AMD Chipset Driver, Gigabyte B650m drivers were all installed, and Windows 11 has all updates installed.\n\n6.

    "selftext": "**System Specs:**\n\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti SUPER (16GB)\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800x\n* **Monitors:**\n   * Primary: 3840x2160 (Ultrawide)\n   * Secondary: 1920x1080\n* **Game Settings:** Ultra Presets on both displays\n\n**issue:**\n\nI'm experiencing **low GPU utilization** in both **EA Sports FC 26** and **Battlefield 6**, resulting in **noticeable input delay** and inconsistent frame pacing.\n\nKey observations:\n\n* GPU utilization is often **well below expected levels**, averaging around **20‚Äì30%**, even under heavy graphical loads.\n* CPU utilization sits around **60%**, so there doesn‚Äôt appear to be a clear CPU bottleneck.\n* Interestingly, running both games at **Ultra settings on 4K ultrawide (3840x2160)** gives me **similar FPS** to playing on a **1080p monitor**, which suggests the GPU isn't being properly leveraged.\n* I've tried increasing graphical settings to push the GPU harder, but utilization remains low and performance doesn‚Äôt improve significantly.\n\n\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**\n\n* Tested on both monitors independently\n* Adjusted graphics settings (low to ultra)\n* Verified thermal performance ‚Äì no thermal throttling\n* Ensured latest GPU drivers (NVIDIA) and chipset drivers (AMD)\n* Game Mode enabled in Windows, and HAGS tested both on and off\n* Power plan set to High Performance\n* V-Sync and frame caps disabled during testing\n* Background processes minimized\n\nAny technical guidance or suggestions for further diagnostics would be appreciated.\n\n  \nThanks.",

    "selftext": "This season I plan to give my computer some love and get a little upgrade.  I dont super need to, performance is still fine, but its been a while and ive got an itch to, so its my present to myself this year.  I upgraded a few years ago, like 2022 i think, but the centerpiece then was my gpu.  I simultaneously hit the tail end of gpu shortage prices, while also jsut missing the launch of the radeon 7000 series, double wammy but my 6900xt has served me well and Im happy.  And my prior gpu had been a little 1650 super, so a monumental leap in performance.  But I digress this time around I am looking to upgrade my cpu, and finally move off the am4 socket.\n\nCurrent specs:\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600x\n\n32 GB ram\n\nAMD radeon 6900xt\n\n3440x1440 165hz Ultra wide monitor (Asus TUF VG34VQL1B)\n\nMy computer is mostly a gaming machine, but I do some p\\[productivity tasks, notably 3d modeling with Autodesk Fusion.  I play a small variety of games, nothing esports competitive, nothing that I really need the bleeding edge maximum fps, minimum graphic setting 1080p monitor cranking 600 fps.  Mostly Tarkov, war thunder, playing through borderlands 4 with buddies, will pick up battlefield 6 when it eventually hits a decent sale, heavily modded mincraft.  I dont need the absolute best of the best cpu, I hoenstly dont really do anything to really warrant it, but some use cases will benefit from it, and if Im spending the money on a new fancy cpu, I want it to have the new fancy kid on the block with the x3d cache.  And truth be told, my gpu wouldnt nearly push a 9800x3d, but eventually I will upgrade my gpu, in another couple years or so, and I'd hate for it to be held back cause i skimped on CPU now.  And I do know the performance difference between the 7800 and 9800 tends to blurr a bit when you leave optimum 1080p specs, so my ultra wide is kinda muddying the water a bit.\n\nSo I request the consensus on the best option.  I will most likely be buying a motherboard cpu combo from micro center unless a better deal is found elsewhere, im not opposed the open box shelves if they got better prices.  I will be sticking with the B-series motherboards as I do not need any of the fanciness the X-series has, despite how pretty they are.  I will be getting at least 32gb of ram to go with, though I saw some decent deals when researching earlier and may splurge on 64 for the heck of it if the price is right.  Ive seen some other threads discussing similar topics and the price difference was like $200 or more between the 7800 and 9800, and for that range the performance difference would be negligible enough for me to just save the money, but currently the gap is more like $80 and at the range its more tempting, so i ask is it worth it for the 9800x3d?  \n\nOr for conversation sake anynone rooting for the 7600x3d?  Its significantly cheaper being $120/200 cheaper than the 7800/9800x3d.  But I can find very few reviews for the seemingly micro center exclusive processor, so I havent really been able to give it a proper comparison to the others, what kinda performace would I be missing out on going with the super budget friendly option.\n\nNow lets be clear, I can afford the full fat 9800x3d, so budget isnt really the conversation here, but if the performance just isnt there to be worth it I will happily save my money, or better yet put it towards the ram splurge, or a new ssd.  I would just like to here some opinions on the best plan here.  Or maybe even none at all, I havent really been keeping up with tech news in a while, so I literally dont know whats on the horizon, is there a new release, or a refresh coming up that I should wait on?  Either to get the new fancy thing or jsut hit the deals form the stuff being retired?\n\nAnd lastly, for those who I know will be here completely ignoring the topic of I want to upgrade my cpu and not my gpu, I will ask you this, my budget for all this is around $800.  If I didnt buy literally any of what I just talked about and put it all in my gpu, what do you recommend?",

    "selftext": "TLDR; should i go budget B650 or all out x870e-e asus gaming?\n\nUse case/history.  \nSo my asrock nova x870e bit the dust, I have a 600+AUD refund coming from amazon (and hopefully a new 9800x3d coming from amd ‚Äì both RMAd ‚Äì amazon has said they will give me a refund) so i at least need a new motherboard.\n\nsteering clear of asrock due to the amount of issues with the boards and 9800x3d. Was thinking i could easily put a couple/few hundred in with no major issues as i wont really miss it (so budget upto about 1k AUD), and going a cheaper board, like the tomahawk, yields about a 100 excess in my account ‚Äì which will be gone next time i buy a couple items at the supermarket, so not really worth going a little cheaper to save money.\n\nNow, was initially I was thinking of going the MSI (perhaps carbon) seeing as they seem stable, however, thinking as i have an asus 7900xtx, if i get an asus board, all the flashy lights will synchronize, and that would be kinda cool.\n\nso an x870e-e gaming may be my best bet, which ive been waiting on a awesome special on (will probably wait until black Friday/cyber monday sales, and hopefully trade off less than 100 to get a better board ‚Äì given i am waiting on the AMD RMA, and for amazon to issue the refund anyways, there is no major rush.)\n\nHOWEVER, and here is the part that i came to you experts for...\n\nGiven the only thing i really set on my nova was the expo for the 6000 ram (though that said, this was due to it being unstable), The asus board could be overkill ‚Äì though i love the idea of an AI overclock doing all the work for me. (and, as i said, getting a slightly cheaper board saving 100 wouldn't really affect us) BUT, I could look into something like the \"Gigabyte AM5 ATX B650 EAGLE AX DDR5 Motherboard\" which is above just 200 bux AUD, which in turn would net me 400 dollar savings, over the refund of the nova x860e.\n\nI love the idea of the pcie 5 ‚Äì however 4 would do me, as the 7900xtx wouldn't be toooo throttled by it,  \ni love the idea of 4-5 nvme, but i only have 2 and a single 4TB ssd, so would have enough room for more drives, one is even a 5.0 slot on the gigabyte.  \nI love the idea of usb 4.0 but dont really have a need for it at the moment. would be good to future proof. considering this only has 3.2 gen 1. (not even gen 2)  \nI love the idea of wifi 7, though my house only has wifi 6.  \nI love the idea of multi gigabit network given im hoping to plug my server into a 10gb uplink, (but the switch is only gb anyways ‚Äì and im not looking to drop 700 on a multi gb switch)\n\n(rest of system  \nRAM: SP Silicon Power XPOWER Pulse 64GB (2x32GB) DDR5 6000MHz  \npower supply RM1000x shift.  \ncase nzxt h9 flow (supports 3.2 gen 2)  \ncooler: nzxt kraken elite 360  \nboot disk: kingston fury renegade  \nsecondary nvme lexam 790nm  \nevo 970 4TB sata  \ncpu 9800x3d  \nmonitor: Samsung 57 inch g95nc)\n\nso currently the B650 would suit my needs, and Id get a 400 refund, which would be nice, but not essential, (probably wouldn't be too missed)  \nbut i can easily afford to drop a couple hundred more on a better board as well.\n\nat the same time, i hate waste.\n\nwhat are everyone's thoughts in regards to what way i should go, as i said, give or take 1-200 bux isnt going to make or break us.\n\n400 hundred would be nice (and considering id be spending another 200 ‚Äì its closer to 600 saved)\n\nhowever, i love gadgets and tech, can afford the nicer board without really caring about the extra cash, and considering the rest of my system is fairly peek, is it just a kick in the guts to get a cheap motherboard? or will it really not make much of a difference in my use case.\n\nb650 may suit my needs  \nx870e would future proof it and i'd be able to put the next gen CPU in it anyways. (given AMD plans to support socket five until AT LEAST 2027 ‚Äì with that said, i usuaually jump a few generations IE 8700K to 9700x3d)\n\nusing it for gaming, AI, software dev.\n\nand for those who do, Thanks for taking the time to weigh in!",

    "selftext": "As of right now I can get a 5070 for $475, 9070 for $530, and 9060 XT for $340. Yes this is under msrp but I'm factoring in 5% back w/ prime visa. I have the budget for a 9070/5070, but if the added performance for \\~$190 more than a 9060 XT isn't substantial enough, will I be better off with that instead?\n\nFor context, I play in 1440p and want a card with enough raw performance that it'll still hold up 5 years later, even when it stops receiving new AI/upscaling features. The factors I'm considering:\n\n9070:  \n\\- Pros: better performance than 5070. I would've picked 9070XT but I'm trying to buy from amazon to maximize savings and they don't have a near MSRP model yet. I'd rather have a gpu ordered in the next few weeks and then return it if a better deal comes out closer to black friday, as I need my pc ready by December for school and can't afford my top option selling out closer to that date. I also picked the 9070 over the 9070XT because of lower power draw, and since there's no 9070XT on amazon close to MSRP still. I can get one for MSRP at micro center but it's $70 more (no cashback), and the limited return window messes up my plan above, plus I can't return it easily.\n\n\\- Cons: not much other than price and potential lack of new software features after next generation?\n\n5070:\n\nPros: cheaper, plus Nvidia tends to be better about supporting older cards over the years, like bringing the newer DLSS features to older gpus, while AMD isn't officially supporting the 7000 series/older w/ FSR 4 features. Nvidia's CUDA cores are still better for most productivity work, since I also need to be able to run certain coding emulators/OS (stuff that drains my macbook battery insanely fast). Path tracing is better too, but I don't care about that too much.\n\nCons: 12gb of VRAM...\n\n9060XT:\n\nPros: 16gb of VRAM, cheaper than all other options, still good in 1440p.\n\nCons: All the benchmarks I've seen show it heavily relying on FG, FSR in all the new games I want to play and I've always preferred raw performance.\n\nI know the 9070 is better in raw performance than the 5070, but is it worth the extra $50 and worse productivity/support? I always see people saying it's better value at their same price MSRP, but when it's more expensive does that value still hold up? And on top of that are both the 5070 and 9070 worth the extra $130 and $190 over the 9060 XT? \n\nAppreciate any advice.",

    "selftext": "Background: I'm getting ready to put my new pc together that will run on Linux (mint?) OS . I chose to go for a mini-itx build bc of the portability and space. If this info helps, I imagine using it primarily to learn programming, game dev, gaming, and possibly picking up music production (very beginner hobbyist) - which is not very different from what I do now. \n\nContext on my questions: About a week ago I picked up my order at my local microcenter. The guy at the pick up area handed me my order and made a couple of comments about the parts I chose and didn't quite understand what he meant. (I could've asked to elaborate but I was on a time crunch.) He said something about my cpu (or gpu) along the lines of \"wasted Gs\" and something about the integrated graphics. \n\nMy questions: I wanted to know if you happen to know what he meant? How can I learn more about that? How can I determine what is a suitable gpu for my cpu (and/or vice versa) - I look at the specs to make sure they fit and compare between parts and choose what O think is best for my needs. What parts would you swap for a more optimal/compatible matchup if that makes sense? I can always upgrade one part or the other later, right? \n\nI didnt know what he meant, and I wish I had time to chat w him about it. I'm genuinely curious and want to learn more. This is my second time building a pc. If any one can give me advice or tips, I'd greatly appreciate it. \n\n\nAnd to help w knowing what parts were involved, here it is:\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G Phoenix AM5 4.2GHz 8-Core, \nGigabyte B850I AORUS PRO AMD AM5 Mini-ITX Motherboard, \nMSI NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 SHADOW 2X Overclocked, \nG.Skill Trident Z5 RGB Series 64GB 2 x 32GB) DDR5-6000, \nSamsung 990 EVO Plus 1TB Samsung V NAND TLC NAND, abd\nASUS ROG Loki 850 Watt 80 Plus Platinum SFX-L\n\n\nSo far from what I gathered, the Ryzen 7 cpu is limiting the ryx 5070 and I should either upgrade my cpu or downgrade my gpu. \n",

Doesn't this hinder airflow if not using a radiator?\n* Cost - It's higher than I'd like but looking at the ASROCK AMD 9000 series issues and other cheaper boards there seem to be issues with, this mobo looks solid and upgradable later.\n   * The CPU could be swapped for a Risen 5 7600 which is a bit cheaper and comes with a heat sync and fan I believe.\n   * Possibly a cheaper or lower wattage PSU (1000watt is to just be set to go if adding a bluray drive or GPU upgrade)\n\nThanks for any tips or advice!\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NyRmXR)\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 9600X 3.9 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4r4Zxr/amd-ryzen-5-9600x-39-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100001405wof) | $198.45 @ Amazon\n\n**CPU Cooler** | [Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/hYxRsY/thermalright-peerless-assassin-120-se-6617-cfm-cpu-cooler-pa120-se-d3) | $34.90 @ Amazon\n\n**Motherboard** | [Gigabyte X870E AORUS ELITE WIFI7 ATX AM5 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/pLtLrH/gigabyte-x870e-aorus-elite-wifi7-atx-am5-motherboard-x870e-aorus-elite-wifi7) | $289.99 @ Amazon\n\n**Memory** | [\\*G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-7200 CL34 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/qxXJ7P/gskill-trident-z5-rgb-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-7200-cl34-memory-f5-7200j3445g16gx2-tz5rk) | $214.99 @ Newegg\n\n**Memory** | [G.Skill Trident Z5 Royal Neo RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL28 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Hm6NnQ/gskill-trident-z5-royal-neo-rgb-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl28-memory-f5-6000j2836g16gx2-tr5ns) | $196.42 @ Amazon\n\n**Storage** | [\\*Samsung 9100 PRO w/Heatsink 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 5.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/vpBFf7/samsung-9100-pro-wheatsink-1-tb-m2-2280-pcie-50-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-mz-vap1t0cam) | $144.99 @ Newegg\n\n**Video Card** | [\\*Sapphire PULSE Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/w2WmP6/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16-gb-video-card-11350-03-20g) | $379.99 @ Amazon\n\n**Case** | [Phanteks XT PRO ULTRA ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/BXtLrH/phanteks-xt-pro-ultra-atx-mid-tower-case-ph-xt523p1-dbk01) | $78.98 @ Newegg\n\n**Power Supply** | [Corsair RM1000x (2024) 1000 W Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/XZsV3C/corsair-rm1000x-2024-1000-w-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-cp-9020271-na) | $169.95 @ iBUYPOWER\n\n**Operating System** | [Microsoft Windows 11 Home Retail - Download 64-bit](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/7ZpzK8/microsoft-windows-11-home-retail-download-64-bit-kw9-00664) | $129.99 @ B&H\n\n**Monitor** | [Gigabyte GS27QA 27.0\" 2560 x 1440 180 Hz Monitor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/NdV2FT/gigabyte-gs27qa-270-2560-x-1440-180-hz-monitor-gs27qa) | $159.99 @ Newegg\n\n**Keyboard** | [HP HyperX Alloy Core RGB Wired Gaming Keyboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/BvL48d/hp-hyperx-alloy-core-rgb-wired-gaming-keyboard-hx-kb5me2-us) | $39.99 @ Amazon\n\n**Mouse** | [Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED Wireless/Wired Optical Mouse](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Yrw7YJ/logitech-g305-lightspeed-wirelesswired-optical-mouse-910-005280) | $29.99 @ Amazon\n\n| *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n| Total (before mail-in rebates) | $2078.62\n| Mail-in rebates | -$10.00\n| **Total** | **$2068.62**\n| \\*Lowest price parts chosen from parametric criteria |\n| Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-10-20 22:02 EDT-0400 |\n\n",

I've used TigerDirect (I'm in Canada) in the past to get compatible parts and stuff but now that place no longer exist. \n\n  \nMy budget is $2000 CAD and looking to build a PC that's very video friendly. Basically my parents have the PC hooked up to their living room 70'' TV to do most of their PC entertainment. It's mostly heavy video watching (4K movies and shows) that they download off of the internet, and casual web browsing. They have a home theatre system hooked up to the HDMI cable for audio. Wireless internet is not a must as the modem's in the living room. \n\n  \nSo long story short, while they don't game, i'm thinking of building something that's very future-proof for high quality videos they'll watch in the future.

Looking at usb tree view - my motherboard (x870e aorus pro ice) has a 3.2 host controller and my cabinet (LanCool 216) has USB 3.0 Root Hub. I've got a fingerprint scanner that I'm trying to connect to it and it just refuses to work - get a code 10 - device not able to start error.\n\nOn my old PC I had fron panel USB 2.0 connections that were connected to a USB 2.0 header and it worked but don't have these on my new one. Even when I tried connecting the the front USB 3.0 ports via an adaptor to a USB 2.0 header it refused to work - the adapter is workin as I was able to still use other devices on those ports.\n\nTried connecting it to a back USB 2.0 port and resulted in the same error - it does say USB 2.0 on it but in tree view showed it connected to the 3.10 controller. I was only able to get it to work once randomly on a back USB 3.2 Gen 1 port.\n\nIt seems to only be consistently working via a USB 2.0 hub. Have a back 3.2 Gen 1 port connected to a powered hub - worked on that. Connected fron USB 3.0 to a non-powered USB 2.0 hub - worked here as well.\n\nI have XHCI and Legacy USB enabled in the BIOS by default.\n\nIs there a way for getting it to work on the front port without a hub? I'm assuming, with XHCI disabled, all ports will work at USB 2.0 speeds - is it possible to force it for a particular port / ports?",

I don‚Äôt see any technical reason why we can‚Äôt have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

In a realistic medieval world torn apart by ambitions and conflicts, you will work your way up from nothing to risk everything.\n\nOriginally, the game started as a small project by one brave individual (bless Filip Hus√°k! üòä), but soon,¬†**thanks to great feedback and a growing community**, the original idea grew into a much larger and more ambitious project.\n\nAt this point, Filip is no longer alone, and other great people who share his¬†**passion, enthusiasm, and desire**¬†are gradually joining the core team - even professionals with years of experience.\n\nIt is important to mention that the current version is still an early prototype, created almost exclusively by Filip Hus√°k himself.  \nMany visual elements, animations, and systems use temporary or provisional elements that do not reflect the final quality or scope of the game.\n\nOur goal with the ongoing campaign is to¬†**expand the team and begin transforming this prototype into the form we envision and desire**. A form that will be truly worthwhile ‚Äì and we have therefore decided to do whatever it takes.  \nHowever, as is usually the case, nothing can be done for free and only in our spare time.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we have decided to take this bold step and create a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAt this point,¬†**we have reached our first stretch goal**, which we greatly appreciate!\n\nHowever, we are confident of the great potential and would very much like to reach more people, more players and fans who would place their trust in us and help us achieve further stretch goals.\n\nIt is definitely worth mentioning that¬†**Warhorse Studio**, the studio behind¬†**Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2**, has supported us on Kickstarter!\n\n[](https://i.redd.it/rl8yaytmdwvf1.png)\n\nThese are their words:\n\n*‚ÄúHey, all you medieval RPG fans and Kickstarter warriors ‚Äî If you loved Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the story behind its creation, you‚Äôre gonna want to hear this.*  \n*Warhorse Studios once took a bold step ‚Äî launching Kingdom Come via Kickstarter to prove there was a passionate audience for an authentic, story-driven medieval world. That leap of faith resonated.*  \n*Now, a new project is taking up the torch: Legacy of Valor. This ambitious RPG aims to blend open-world exploration, kingdom management, large-scale battles, and deep narrative choices. The devs are starting with a Kickstarter campaign ‚Äî just like old times ‚Äî and inviting us, the fans, to make it happen.*  \n*Let‚Äôs rally behind Legacy of Valor just as early supporters rallied for Kingdom Come. This is where bold dreams meet community power.

At the time and to this day, I have not seen a banner on Humble's store indicating they are out of keys for Ryse: Son of Rome. I am using Chrome and not running any ad blocker, so I suspect this is not an issue with my personal browser. These banners are referenced in Humble's FAQ on key exhaustion. I have exchanged 3 messages with humble support inquiring about the lack of a banner and if the 60-day refund window applies if I have not received a key. Not only did they take on average 7 days to respond they also talked around my questions and provided no real support. I am willing to give a great deal of leeway, after all, this is for charity. That said, the dishonesty or ineptitude of the support team and the implication that Humble can keep my money and provide me with nothing in return just leaves me with a gross feeling that I can't shake. I will never use this storefront again. I have only ever heard good things about Humble. Am I just phenomenally unlucky, or is this a common experience no one talks about?",

Somewhere.\n\nThe biggest twist, is that the battles are fewer, but longer, with new enemies spawning, dropping loot, and allowing you to craft DURING combat.\n\nIt's a bit like an OVA anime from a larger universe.\n\nWe launched in April, but the game is on sale now, and we added a real nice update during the Autumn sale, so I thought I'd give it a try and tell you about the game.\n\nDesign-wise, I tried to focus on having fewer, but more tactically worthwhile spells, and enemies that are mechanically interesting.\n\nSince launch we've put out a few free updates, and hope to make more. Of note is the extra difficult secret level in the final world. We're very attentive to feedback, and the last update was about helping players deal with how they experienced randomness.\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, both the good and the bad stuff.",

    "selftext": "Just now I was playing mafia 2. I am 9 hours into the game and I started the game with hard difficulty like I have started to do with all of my games recently. I have come at a level that is simply impossible to cross, not because of any skill issue but simply because this game has a bad 'Hard' difficulty mode.\n\nThere are games where hard difficulty simply means a basic buff to all enemies. They function like normal npc's but their damaged is increased, they spot you unreasonably fast, and even their pistols shoot kilometers (miles) away and it takes a takes a whole mag to kill one enemy. Your gameplay does not change. You still take cover and shoot, you simply stay in cover for longer, and have to shoot the same enemy twice as much, but its the same.\n\nIn this particular mission in mafia, the enemies are just unfair. Rather than enemies coordinating better, they and their guns have simply been buffed. And I am not lying when I say this, I cannot shoot a Thompson at my target after a certain distance because of insane recoil, my enemies, with that same Thompson, are killing me with 2 bullets from twice that distance. Molotov cocktails fall in front of my cover but I still get damage, and the most baffling part is that I get some damage even behind covers.\n\nThis is a bad hard mode, although understandable because the game came out in 2010. In such a mode, you can overcome with skill only to be lead to such an instance where skill can not overcome the bad design. Like how my enemy keeps throwing molotovs every 5 seconds in a small space filled with constantly spawning enemies, I peak and someone shoots me, I play smart and get killed by a Molotov that isint even near me.\n\nI am also playing wolfenstein currently and it has a much better hard mode. Its actually challenging but most of all, its reasonably challenging, you can improve and get better or retry until you finally clear a level. Enemy damage does increase but they don't turn into bullet sponges, enemies coordinate better and have better reflexes rather than being one shot kill. In Wolfenstein you just have to plan better, remember the med kits and the Armour and use them strategically. But mafia 2 doesnt offer me any such option, the gameplay is yet the same regardless of difficulty.",

    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nRaivk here, one of the two people working on ULTRA VERTIGO. We initially made this as a sequel to Liminascent, our previous first-person platformer, and renamed it because here in France \"Liminascent\" isn't easy to pronounce...\n\nWell, we had a ton of fun making the game as a side project (besides our boring main jobs), and we are excited to see people playing the demo. It's our first solo project on Steam, as we already released a game with a publisher, but now we want more freedom, hence the self-publishing. We'd be more than happy to get feedback on the game, see what you like, what you dislike so we can enhance it and hopefully make something great in the long run! We're aiming for a release by the end of the year, as most of the \"complete\" game is ready.\n\nThe demo here is just a part of the complete game, to get the feeling of it and see if it's for you. We will probably keep the demo up permanently, as we believe it's better to be able to try a game before buying it.\n\nThat's it! Hope you'll enjoy it. I'll be available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nHere is the link of the game if you want to play!  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA\\_VERTIGO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3892250/ULTRA_VERTIGO)",

A bright fantasy with an underlying melancholy is how I‚Äôd describe the thematic heart of AA and we‚Äôve been incredibly happy to see how many people resonated with it.\n\n**It‚Äôs also no lie to say that Astral Ascent was the biggest step forward for us as developers in general, and we‚Äôre still incredibly thankful for the community support we received.**\n\nWe‚Äôve also recently launched our next project, [Fallen Fates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276270/Fallen_Fates/), this time a fantasy RPG (instead of a roguelite) built in collaboration with our community through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernian-workshop/fallen-fates). We‚Äôve learned a lot from our past games ‚Äî Astral Ascent most of all ‚Äî and want to take everything we love about them and carry it over into this new, even more ambitious project‚Ä¶ which, truth be told, probably won‚Äôt be done before 2028 (tentatively speaking) just because of the sheer scope of the project.\n\nIn any case, that‚Äôs the short of it about us.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long road since we first started making games together, and each one has changed the way we think about what we do. Astral Ascent especially left a mark on us, not just in how we design but in how we see the people playing our work. It reminds us why we do this in the first place, and that‚Äôs to make beautiful games people will take joy in playing.\n\n**We‚Äôre excited to chat with you all and answer any questions whatsoever!**   \n\n\nLooking forward to chatting with you all! :)",

I'm posting today because our team is absolutely floored by the community response during the Steam Next Fest, and we wanted to share this incredible milestone with you all.\n\nAs of this morning, our game, **Re:Night**, has climbed to the **#1 Top Demo spot** in the official \"Card Game\" category for the festival.\n\n**You can see the proof here:** [https://imgur.com/a/gPUM0jI](https://imgur.com/a/gPUM0jI)\n\nFor our tiny indie team, this is a legitimate dream come true.\n\nFor those seeing **Re:Night** for the first time, it's our passion project‚Äîa deep, single-player fusion of **roguelike deckbuilding** (think *Slay the Spire*) and **grid-based SRPG tactics** (think *Into the Breach*). It's all about commanding a 3-person squad, where positioning on the board is just as critical as the cards you play.\n\nThe full game is planned for Q4 2025, but the free demo that's currently topping the charts is available for everyone to play right now. We would be genuinely honored to get feedback from one of the most dedicated PC gaming communities on the internet.\n\nI'll be here all day to answer any questions you might have about the game, the development process, or this crazy Next Fest experience.\n\n**Key Links:**\n\n* **Play the Free Demo on Steam:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2372240/ReNight/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2372240/ReNight/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=pcgaming_number1_milestone)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pdmfp9ubivf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c3e3a5c809aa34a4ea14114100c0ce00e841569",

    "selftext": "Windows is very close to being great for gamepads. There are multiple third-party apps (like r/Playnite) that allow for a great gamepad experience in multiple aspects, however, typing is NOT one of them.\n\nA lot of games require typing, which prevents us from having a true couch gaming experience on PC, but there's an easy solution that only Microsoft can provide:\n\n**1 - Allow us to open the new on-screen keyboard (OSK), with gamepad support, that at the moment is reserved for tablets, by clicking or pressing A over text boxes, and through a gamepad button combo.**   \nThis would allow the OSK to be invoked by either simulating a mouse click with the gamepad (for older games), selecting text boxes with A (on modern games that eventually support this feature), or force-opening it with a gamepad combo for games that are particularly iffy with text boxes. This would effectively bypass the need to get out of the sofa and use a keyboard just to name your character in a new RPG, for example. \n\n**2 - Make sure the OSK, on gamepad mode, captures all gamepad inputs for itself, and does not allow these inputs to reach the game in the background.**  \nThis would prevent a big problem with the already existing Steam keyboard: if you're not playing the game with SteamInput enabled (for example, in games that already support Xbox gamepads), all the gamepad buttons being pressed while typing are also reaching the game, causing your character to walk, attack or do whatever actions correspond to the typing shortcuts, including leaving the text box in case of emulators. Capturing all inputs from the gamepad and only sending what is actually being typed (the keyboard keys) would prevent this, and massively increase compatibility with older games.\n\n**Bonus:** give us the fullscreen Windows experience for desktops, and allow it to use custom library managers (like Playnite). This would fix a lot of problems with window focus that can happen when launching games in borderless fullscreen and also make the experience more seamless. \n\nI believe these tweaks would greatly improve the gaming experience on Windows, bringing it much closer to an authentic Xbox experience.",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been wondering about this for a while. Why don‚Äôt we have headphones that can tell if a sound‚Äôs coming from above or below when you tilt your head? It‚Äôs pretty much impossible for game devs to make vertical sound feel real on regular headphones. In real life, we tilt and turn our heads to figure out exactly where a sound‚Äôs coming from. I don‚Äôt see any technical reason why we can‚Äôt have headphones with this kind of feature nowadays, letting you tilt your head in-game to at least figure out if, say, footsteps are above or below you. The only thing I can think of against it is maybe fairness or balancing issues in games. But from a tech standpoint? Should be a piece of cake. What do you guys think?",

I've always known him to be candid and humble - in fact, it's downright challenging to get him to take credit for Counter-Strike - and here, he talks openly about how hard it is to retain players when there's just so much to play.\n\nIf even the creator of Counter-Strike has trouble rising above the noise of modern gaming, what hope have we mortals?\n\nCounter-Strike, Tactical Intervention, Alpha Response ‚Äì there seems to be a type of game he's been chasing all these years. It invariably involves Deagles, GIGNs, and of course, vehicles. But modern warfare is more asymmetrical than the John Woo movies inspiring Gooseman, so he's leveraging these new gadgets to ensure Alpha Response can't be cheesed by campers.\n\nHe also gives his thoughts on the Stop Killing Games movement, and goes in-depth about how he first coded the static recoil patterns in Counter-Strike, which eventually led to most competitive FPS games gravitating towards some version of a static recoil pattern. There are many flavours of it these days, and games like Apex and The Finals have started to play with wildly different recoil patterns while rewarding high movement playstyles.",

[https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c)\n\nI wouldd love to learn more if anyone has links from EMBARK or their dev blogs, if those exist. To me, it‚Äôs amazing that AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúbullet‚Äù for discussions about people losing their jobs, but instead can literally be a game-changing creative tool. Thanks!  \n",

    "selftext": "Guys I never have a pc before and each year kept passing I was getting worried that the am4 platform are gonna die somewhere that year (based on what I heard).\n\nIm planning to use ryzen 5 5600 and rx 580, later upgrade to rx 6700 xt but since what it feels like the death of the platform could coming Im hoping am4 could live in a couple more years. And since I cant afford am5 yet (the cpu and the ram). it feels like when I do get am4 next year, I would waste my money around 2-3 years later upgrading to am5.\n\nEspecially the motherboard, specifically the micro atx version. Im starting to have concerns about this man. And since I can't afford like the atx version, is the matx even enough for the use cases? I need to know few things about micro atx besides amount of storage ports. And my use case(same as you guys) of this is generally gaming and 3d rendering.\n\nSo what are your thoughts about this? Please let me and other people know about this to those who scared about am4 platform dying especially to those who just started to have one\n",

I asked a friend, and they said the problem might be either the power supply or the motherboard, and to ask here.\n\n  Any help is appreciated, I've been thinking of upgrading my motherboard anyway..\n\nB450M Steel Legend  \nRyzen 5 5600x  \nGigabyte PB500  \nRTX 2070 Super / RX 590",

    "selftext": "I have unexpectedly been put in a situation where I need to move.  I'm moving in with some family but the loft area ill be staying in doesn't have any outlets. The only option for power is a random extension cord that has been ran up there from a distance. I was originally planning on moving my pc setup up there but that draws roughly 700-900 watts under load. There literally isn't any way to get an outlet up there but that's pretty much my only option rn. But due to there just being a single extension cord ran up there now im not so sure if using my pc up there is doable. Unless that's safe? If the extension cord is high quality can I plug in a surge protector and just plug my stuff in? I cant quite figure out what to do. Is there any way to do this that is reasonably safe? Or am I over reacting? I don't know.",

Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA‚Äôs foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI‚Äôm totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card‚Ä¶ \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I‚Äôm usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can‚Äôt believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately.

Suddenly, the screen went black during moderately graphic intensive work in Unreal Engine, but the sound still was on. \nAfter a reboot, the motherboard gave me a D6 error (no GPU found), and there was a noticeable stench of burnt plastics coming from the PC, so I was fearing the worst. \nWhen I tried to disconnect the card from the included MSI power cable, it was really hard to pull out (plastic welded as I later realised). The cable was definitely fitted all the way in, and the PC case is also large and well-ventilated, and there was no strain whatsoever on the cable. I can definitely rule out any user error here.\nWhen I finally managed to pull it out, I saw all six (+) power cables smoked.\n\nThis is a $3000 card, and I bought it in the hopes that the large liquid cooler would keep temperatures at bay. But it seems like nothing can compensate for NVIDIA‚Äôs foolishness going again with this terribly designed connector.\nI‚Äôm totally devastated having wasted so much money on this card‚Ä¶ \n\nAt least I managed to shut off the PC before it burned my house down. As I‚Äôm usually leaving the PC unattended for rendering at night. This is a huge health and safety risk and could easily lead to fires and potentially killing people. I can‚Äôt believe the largest company in the world is not able to design their cards adequately.

Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything‚Äôs dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

    "selftext": "**Please ignore the cables and mess, that is currently in progress to be fixed.**  \n  \nI‚Äôm trying to add a 4th display under my main monitor. All three of my current monitors are wall-mounted, so there‚Äôs about an 8.5-inch vertical gap between the desk and the bottom edge of the middle screen. I‚Äôd like to fill that space with a small monitor that can tilt upward toward me, something around 15 inches smaller or larger is fine if it fits nicely.\n\nI work two remote jobs. My main desktop runs my primary job, and my company laptop handles a second, lighter role where I mostly respond to messages and manage a small team. Both setups really benefit from having two screens. I plan to use a KVM switch to share my keyboard/mouse and possibly one or two monitors between the systems, but I‚Äôd like a dedicated screen underneath the middle monitor for quick multitasking.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Fits within an 8.5-inch gap under my center monitor\n* Can tilt upward (20‚Äì35¬∞ ideally)\n* Doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy ‚Äî 1080p is fine\n* Ideally plug-and-play (HDMI or USB-C)\n* Clean look that blends well with my setup\n\nI‚Äôve looked into stretch bar displays, which would look amazing, but most are expensive or complicated to set up. So I‚Äôm leaning toward a portable monitor as a practical option for now. I just want to see if anyone has found a budget-friendly tilted display that fits under a main monitor like this.",

    "selftext": "Finally got my setup to a place I‚Äôm happy with, so figured I‚Äôd share. My old chair‚Äôs recline mechanism broke and it was basically stuck in full chill mode 24/7. It was a cheap one I grabbed a while back, so I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised ‚Äî but it definitely forced my hand to upgrade.\n\nPicked up this new chair, the [Autonomous Ergo Ultra 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/autonomous-chair-ultra-v2), and it‚Äôs a total game changer. Way better build quality, great lumbar support, and super comfy for both long work days and late-night gaming. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad my old one was until now.\n\nAlso added some new stands for the [Edifier MR4s](https://a.co/d/3rbA0t1), a [Tonor TD510](https://a.co/d/f6XnbSq) mic, and a new desk shelf. Not ready to drop for a Shure SM7B yet.\n\nNow that everything‚Äôs dialed in, the setup feels complete. For now =)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

This is a common problem with a GMMK 3, I was just willing to fix it. Definitely not an advertisement lol. I know Glorious gets a lot of hate, but I still enjoy the board even with the known issues. \n\nI enjoy playing around with these boards because of the ability to customize them. I have many other keyboards with about as much customizability, but they don‚Äôt have a matching numpad for me to play with. I finally decided to get the brass plates and do a black and gold build for my cheap keyboard.\n\nKeyboard(s): Glorious GMMK 3 Pro Barebones (Wired Only) and GMMK Numpad \n\nI have 3 plates for these, for this set up it has the Brass Plate. I also swapped out the knobs, the badge on the keyboard and the badge on the numpad for gold options.

It burnt with some cokes spilled on it.\n\n**Logitech G Pro TKL (in action but will be gone soon)**\n\nThe swappable keys are probably not contacting well. Now more than 10 keys on it double types with a single press. I am throwing this away.\n\n**Roccat 120 AIMO (gone)**\n\nThe most beautiful keyboard I had. I especially liked the volume knob on it too. After pulling and cleaning it a few times, it started not recognizing key press from time to time. I am not sure but maybe due to its thin caps not sitting right after a few resits.\n\n**Razer Huntsman V2 (in action)**\n\nMy favorite except the price. I would buy it again if it is a bit cheaper. \n\n**Cherry MX 2.0 (in action)**\n\nI use this at work place. A good reliable keyboard. Volume keys stting at FN + F1\\~F3 isn't my favorite, but it works. They actually have better idea with cheaper KC200 with volume keys on top of the number pad but I cannot stand with cheap plastic casing.\n\nSo, I need to get rid of aforementioned G Pro. I swapped problematic keys with less used function keys but I just about had it after about 10 keys with the problem. I am running out of function keys now.\n\nI wanted to try Keychrone but I am just about fed up with reliability issues and GPT inquiry say Cherry is more reliable choice. Not that I trust that 100%.\n\nSo I am thinking maybe Cherry MX 3.0 as I am no longer willing to spend more than $100 for a keyboard now. It is a plain boring choice with volume keys at odd locaiton. What other brand would you recommend? Maybe still Keychrone?",

    "title": "HMX Firecracker has tickled a weird part of my brain and I may never recover: a review.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost - I'm a tactile switch lover through and through. I've tried a fair number this year, the most recent being the Sillyworks x Gateron Type R. I've tried both more budget options (I see you Akko V3 Cream Blue Pro!) and more premium offerings like the Drop x Invyr Holy Pandas. I've spent too much money but honestly I no longer care because I may have found IT. The one. Maybe my HG switch?\n\nI was ~~stalking~~ cruising Milktooth's website recently for my next poor financial decision, when I decided to sort by 'new arrivals' and 'tactile'. I felt I had a fairly decent handle on the switch world at this point, and was tickled both pink (and poor) but the number of exciting new tactile releases this year. I'll be real - the marketing spiel for HMX Firecracker got me GOOD. Flaubertian, you say? It was all hyperbole for sure but if you appeal to my inner literary snob you can take my money because you've earned it. I had absolutely no idea who the switch designer, Yowzers, was.  Not a single clue. The blue, red and white colour scheme kind of put me off for some ill-defined reason. But I was definitely intrigued, so I added HMX Firecracker to my cart along with the HMX Ice Lotus (Heavy version). Shipping is so damn expensive from the US to Australia I feel I have to order at least two different switches at a time to make the painful shipping fee worth it.\n\nAnyway. I received my switches yesterday amongst all my other online orders (thank god I live alone). I was too tired to do more than pull a switch out of each bag and give it a little tippy tap with my finger last night. But right from the word go, Firecracker had me going 'ooooh!'. The same could not be said for the Ice Lotus, but this post is not about that switch. First thing this morning, I got up and yoinked my Type R's right out of my Mage Studios x Beserkeys Love65 and got to work. I also wanted to switch my keycaps out from GMK Fleuriste to GMK Art, so it was the perfect task to swap out the switches at the same time.\n\nHere comes the one bit of criticism for this switch - there were a lot of bent pins in my order. I order 90 switches every time so I can put a switch in either the smallest (65%) or largest (TKL) of the boards in my very modest collection. I found so many switches with bent pins I started separating them from the pack. However, if they were bent it was easily corrected with just my fingers. No pliers or other tools required. This might have been down to the switches being packed and shipped in a plastic seal bag, but it was worth noting anyway.\n\nI have ALL the foams in my Love65. That said - these switches are BRIGHT and give a very satisfying clack despite all the foams I have in my board. They are SNAPPY. And the tactile event and noise does something weird to my brain that is hard to describe. I love it, but if you asked me to describe exactly why or how I just can't. If I had to compare these switches to anything, I would have to say it would be Gateron Baby Kangaroos only brighter, louder and snappier with a more satisfying tactile bump. That said, my BK's are hand lubed and filmed - BK's straight from the factory may be different.\n\nIf you are a tactile switch lover still in search of your HG switch, HMX Firecracker is a must try. It's good to go straight out of the box too - I don't feel the need to have these hand lubed or filmed at all. These are right up there for me as maybe my favourite switch I have tried so far this year, along with the Drop x Invyr Holy Panda's and Sillyworks x Gateron Type R's. Happy typing all :)",

There are broken rivets so it will need a bolt mod in addition to building a case of some sorts and something to connect to the membrane cables to wire up to a controller.  But the keycaps are very cool and split a spacebar... heck yeah.  For now, it'll sit in the collection as I have a long list of projects to work on.  But someday, this thing will rock again.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! Calvin with Clackify here.\n\nI'm happy to announce I've officially listed Clackify keyboard stands on my store!\n\nA few features:\n\nHolds 5 Keyboards:\nDisplays 4 keyboards on shelves with an additional keyboard slot in the middle for a 5th. I like hiding a fun 60% build in the 5th slot personally :)\n\nKeyboard Protection:\nStands are stable, support 15 lbs per shelf and have been thoroughly strength tested. Cork pads and silicone bumpers are built into each shelf to ensure boards are fully protected and prevent slippage. The bottom of the stand is also equipped with silicone pads to ensure the stand itself doesn't slide around.\n\nUSB Dongle/Flash Drive Storage:\nOffers USB dongle storage for storing and keeping track of wireless dongles as well as flash drives (28 slots total). Note these are not powered or connected, they are purely for storage. No more mixing up or losing your wireless dongles!\n\nPegboard Slots:\nThe back of the stand is equipped with skadis slots for various purposes. The stands are compatible with a variety of skadis accessories and hooks. There are also two slots on each side of the stand for a side hook/accessory. Be on the lookout for skadis accessories to start showing up on the Clackify store as well!\n\n14 Color Options:\nThere are a variety of color options ranging from simple colors to translucent and even Galaxy (sort of metallic) options.\n\nCustomizations:\nIf you'd like to have anything customized, don't hesitate to reach out! Other colors would be possible, and design tweaks could potentially be made for a small fee. Adding logos is also a possibility.\n\nFree US Shipping:\nKeyboard Stands (and any orders over $75 for that matter) ship free to locations in the US.\n\nMore information and photos can be found here: https://clackify.com/products/clackify-keyboard-stand-4-tier\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!

    "selftext": "I have built/modded several premium boards, but regardless of that fact,  I picked up a used Ducky One Mini. I had seen a video by Alex Otos, praising his 60% Ducky budget keyboard. He said it was his go-to for gaming. Therefore I decided to pick one up and guess what? I love it. I can‚Äôt really explain it, but it just feels good to type on. It has a quiet sound profile (which I typically hate), and has a pretty minimalist vibe to it.\n\nWhen I first bought it (used off of eBay), I immediately regretted it because I felt I overpaid for it after I foolishly looked around and found some for half the price. As soon as I got it, I tried to swap out keycaps and those freakin‚Äô inductive switches came out with every single keycap! I soon realized the used budget keycap set I had grabbed (off of eBay, as well) were way too tight. I had to fight every single switch to get it out of the keycap I had pulled off (when I decided I didn‚Äôt like them and chose to go back to the original keycaps). They were so hard to detach from the keycaps, my hands were killing me. I finally resorted to a rubber jar gripper that made the job a little easier as I got down to the last few keycaps.\n\nThe inductive switches came out crazy easy and I was not happy about that. However, when I got it back together again and just chose a few colorful keycaps for some modifier keys, I liked the simple look of it (and I will never again swap out the keycaps!) My hands literally ached the entire next day. \n\nHowever, after using it for a few days, I was hooked!  You have got feel it to understand it.\n\nLayout: 60%\nConnectivity: Tri-mode\nCase: ABS\nMount Style: Gasket-mount\nPlate material: SPCC Steel\nSwitches: Ducky Inductive Switches-linear, 3.5 mm total travel, 40g initial force\nDampening Design: Ducky QUACK Mechanics+ with 7-layer dampening\nKeycaps: Ducky 85% high-purity PBT Double-shot PBT\nStabalizers: Ducky Plate-Mounted\nHot-Swappable: Yes\nReport Rate: 1000 Hz\nSoftware: Web-based \nModifier Keycaps - Double-shot PBT (Ali Express)\n\n",

And I love it! I got all parts and built it nearly two days ago.\n\nI had no experience on mechanical keyboards (unless we count typing some Red Dragon keyboard I found in some store for one second), so I was gambling how the switches should behave. And I really like what I chose... I don't want to say I hit the jackpot yet, still a very new keyboard.\n\nThe keycaps have an uneven height... You can see on the function keys on the middle. But so far, not an actual issue when using my keyboard. And they're like soft on the touch, I really like that. I really liked the look of the MOA profile, and I think they're comfortable in general, especially when playing Tetris - my fingers sit on them seemingly flawlessly.\n\nNot on the sound test video but basically the numpad has a clacky sound in addition. Not (very) loud, especially how I'll almost only use it on Blender, pressing one specific key before I move back to the other keyboard or my mouse.\n\nInserting the keycaps on slot with stabalizers... For the stubborn ones (the enter key being the worst offender) - and I'll admit I don't know if it even actually worked or I was just lucky (I was past at my sleep schedule at that point lmao), I was raising and centering the cross thingies, then have the respective keyboard upside down with my hand (or arm, 1kg keyboard lmao), and insert they keycap in. I had to do all that process more than once with a couple of keycaps, but I did manage to make sure the stabalizers actually do their job.\n\nI have two PCs (a tower, and a tiny Single Board Computer), so the wireless features on both keyboards are reeeeally comfortable for me. I don't mind the keyboard's weight when I have to take out my graphics tablet, my desk is big enough to move around everything I need.",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "title": "Overhauled Lemokey L3",
    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .¬† everything went smoothly;¬† no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.¬† It‚Äôs probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and ‚Äúhow to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers‚Äù videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).¬† Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote¬† - without needing to look at any references during the build. ¬†\n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced ‚Äî just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;¬† make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;¬† checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn‚Äî->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys). ¬†\n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:¬† prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it‚Äôs too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you‚Äôre probably excited to complete quickly.¬† The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta‚Äô get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**¬† if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n¬†¬† **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;¬† $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;¬† unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.¬† (I‚Äôm liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n¬†",

I love this board and it's a mainstay for me. It really is an endgame-like keyboard for me personally in the configuration I have it before, and in this new one too... I tried to embrace the more playful style with a colourful pop and some keycaps I tried to design to match that. \n\nNot a pro at photography nor product photography, so apologies for that; but I hope the design comes through enough.",

Here's the link for F108 Pro (you can search for the others on their site):\n\n[https://aulakeyboard.com/product/aula-f108-pro/](https://aulakeyboard.com/product/aula-f108-pro/)\n\nThere's Keychron Q6, but I hate the knob position:\n\n[https://keychron.net.br/pt/products/keychron-q6-qmk-tecladomecanicopersonalizado?srsltid=AfmBOoqCbCbC18iLNDkQEUTDxdqPd9j0wFKEN5vK5Mus2kB85GjmFlEV](https://keychron.net.br/pt/products/keychron-q6-qmk-tecladomecanicopersonalizado?srsltid=AfmBOoqCbCbC18iLNDkQEUTDxdqPd9j0wFKEN5vK5Mus2kB85GjmFlEV)\n\nThen if you're a rich guy you can customize a GMMK Pro (U$ 500+):\n\n[https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk-3-configurator?step=1&language=English+%28US%29&size=100%25&connectivity=Wired&configSwitchTechnology=Standard+Hotswap+%28MX%29&configPcbOrientation=North-facing&configLayout=ANSI&bottomCase=Black&topCase=Black&switches=Fox+Ultralight+MX&keycaps=Classic+Black&os=Windows&badge=Black&rotaryKnob=Jet+Black&cable=Standard+Black&gasketModules=Firm+%28Silicone%29&switchPlate=Silver+Aluminum&defaults.keycaps=Backlit+Black&defaults.bottomCase=Black%2CJet+Black](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk-3-configurator?step=1&language=English+%28US%29&size=100%25&connectivity=Wired&configSwitchTechnology=Standard+Hotswap+%28MX%29&configPcbOrientation=North-facing&configLayout=ANSI&bottomCase=Black&topCase=Black&switches=Fox+Ultralight+MX&keycaps=Classic+Black&os=Windows&badge=Black&rotaryKnob=Jet+Black&cable=Standard+Black&gasketModules=Firm+%28Silicone%29&switchPlate=Silver+Aluminum&defaults.keycaps=Backlit+Black&defaults.bottomCase=Black%2CJet+Black)\n\n**If you don't need hotswap**\n\nThen there's plenty of options. But I really want hotswap. Here's some of them. I won't link all link, just look for them:\n\nDas Keyboard (several)\n\nSpectre Pro\n\nSteelseries Apex\n\nMountain Everest\n\nThermaltake (several)\n\nMajestouch ninja\n\nLeopold (several)\n\nCoolmaster (several)\n\nCherry keyboards (several)\n\nAdesso (several)\n\niONE Scorpius\n\nLogitech K845\n\nMax Keyboard\n\nTurtle Beach (several)\n\nRosewill (several) speacially Neon K90\n\nCougar Attack X3\n\nAJazz AK35i\n\nCorsair (several) ",

This time around I chose my Hola Mini, which I topped with GMK Rewind. I used Gateron Pro Ultra Glory Yellow switches, which I feel fit the theme and frankly sound great in this board, creamy and marbley, just super pleasing.\n\nOf course, since I manged to snag GMK Rewind from Key Machine while it was still selling the set, I had to get the Retape deskmat from Cannonkeys, which just looks slick as hell on the desk with its bright colors. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty simple build since I went with the hotswap PCB, and something about the 80s theme really appeals to me as a child of the 80s. That's why I tossed a Madball and Macross figure. It's 80's revival, basically, since everything pictured is new. One of my favorites!\n\nOf course, I will be adding this build to the Keebuilder app, which I'm a fan of since [it's making it easy ](https://guiltygamer.com/keebuilder-intuitive-app-mechanical-keyboard-enthusiasts/)to catalog all of my builds.\n\nNext week will be a Halloween theme, and I can't wait!",

    "selftext": "Couple weeks ago, Awekeys contacted me and asked me if I would like to try one of their sets. I said sure because I was always curious about these metal keycaps. I debated whether I wanted to do a new build for these keycaps or if I wanted to use one of my existing boards. I looked at what I had and thought the Lemokey L3 would be perfect for this. I chose it mainly for its color. I wanted to challenge myself because the navy blue only goes with certain colors. \n\nThis board had gateron baby kangaroo v2 switches. I decided to try out durock blue lotus T1 switches. The keys are about 5 x the weight of normal keys so I had to put 80g springs in the switches with bigger keycaps. Other than that everything went without a hitch. \n\nThe keycaps feel great with this board thanks to the fact that this board has a lot of sound deadening material much similar to ‚Äúdynamat‚Äù which is used for speaker installs. \n\nIt was a nice surprised to know that I chose the right board because I tried these keys on other boards with less foam and materials and they sounded hollow in those kind of boards. But with this board right here, it sounds and feels right at home. \n\nMy honest opinions on this set :\n\nI think that these keycaps look good and feel good on THIS board. I say this because like I said above, I‚Äôve tried it on my other boards and it sounds hollow on some. I feel that these keycaps are specialized and not as versatile as other keycaps like our normal PBT and ABS caps. But that‚Äôs ok. These are specialized therefore a specialized board is needed to experience the full potential of these caps. \n\nInstallation wasn‚Äôt hard with the tool they provide. I‚Äôve seen the how to install video that Awekeys has on their site. It‚Äôs the one where they take a hammer to it. I installed mine using the tool but never using a hammer. In fact I didn‚Äôt know the hammer was a thing until after the install I stumbled on a post by some here and I took a look at the video. Another this is be aware that you need an 80g spring for the bigger keycaps. Before installing those springs, the spacebar just felt god awful and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt reset back into its neutral position. So just be aware of changing out springs with keycaps that use stabs. \n\nThese keycaps give the keyboard a unique feel. Albeit it won‚Äôt be my daily driver but it‚Äôs a nice change. Sort of a pallet cleanser if you will. Between my thocky and clacky builds, this is a very welcome addition to my collection. \n\n\nI‚Äôll link sound test on a reply. ",

    "selftext": ". . . .¬† everything went smoothly;¬† no rattling space bar, wonky stabilizers, or anything that needed to be fixed.¬† It‚Äôs probably due to the fact that I probably over-prepared for the build by watching and re-watching tofu build videos and ‚Äúhow to lube / assemble, and mount stabilizers‚Äù videos (the alexotos stabilizer video on YouTube is brilliant, even though I deviated from his recommendations in one instance).¬† Also studied the official build guide until I felt I could do the entire build by rote¬† - without needing to look at any references during the build. ¬†\n\nI also proceeded very slowly and deliberately and did all the recommended little checks (e.g., make sure stabilizer wires are perfectly balanced ‚Äî just the space bar wire took me 15 minutes to straighten perfectly;¬† make sure all the switches are mounted flush with the plate;¬† checking that I could see every switch pin going through on the underside of the pcb, etc.).\n\nThis was also my first 60%, so it actually took me an additional hour of back-and-forth to decide on all the key re-mappings (e.g., media keys) and the design of my Fn‚Äî->MO(1) layer mapping (e.g., arrow keys, navigation keys). ¬†\n\nThe **only big thing I would do differently** next time:¬† prep all the stabilizers in advance of the build, i.e., it‚Äôs too tedious and finicky a task to be doing in the middle of a keyboard build that you‚Äôre probably excited to complete quickly.¬† The funny thing is that in this case, I only had to prep 3 sets of stabilizers since I decided to go split <R-Shift> and split <Backspace> key layouts, and it still took forever (I mean, gotta‚Äô get that perfectly even layer of lube on).\n\n**Main lesson to be gleaned:**¬† if a dope like me can do it, anyone can.\n\n¬†¬† **TOTAL COST:**\n\n* Tofu60 2.0 kit $160 case, pcb/usb-c daughterboard, polycarbonate plate, foam kit, stabs\n* Stabilzers $0 stock, included in kit\n* Switches $20 Gateron G Pro Blue (re-purposed from old un-used keyboard;¬† $20 on Amazon)\n* Keycaps $75 PBTfans BOW;¬† unused set previously purchased\n* Lube, supplies $7 lube/supples \\~ $20, amortized over prospective 3 builds (need to run it by my accountant)\n\nTotal US$262\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(This reddit post typed on my new daily driver, KBDfans Tofu60 2.0.¬† (I‚Äôm liking the 60% life so far.))\n\n¬†",

For reference I mostly use it for productivity, movie watching and also some light gaming occassionally (casual online FPS games).  \n  \nI have a 32\" 4K at work that is great for productivity, but I went with the 1440p 27\" because I my PC isn't powerful enough to run games at 4k, but now realize FSR and integer scaling is supported by my GPU, so this would be less of a problem, right? \n\nSo does it make more sense to go with a 4K 32\"? Will the scaling be clearer/cleaner and have less potential issues with apps with the 4k over the 1440p? \n\nAm I missing anything? \n\nThank you!",

Powered by advanced Mini-LED technology, these monitors deliver vivid, high-contrast visuals, making them especially ideal for HDR content and immersive gaming experiences.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1jd5uocdwf1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37badcde8916b5a54460b9258f6571ba2dcf5c7\n\n**Mini-LED Backlight with 1152 Local Dimming Zones**\n\nAll three models are equipped with 1,152 full-array local dimming zones, deliver peak brightness of up to 1000 nits, and are VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified for a premium HDR experience with stunning clarity and contrast.\n\nCompared with conventional LCD monitors, the Mini-LED backlight technology provides a reduced halo effect, deeper blacks without being grayish, delivering precise light control and more lifelike, vivid visuals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvkqby5tcdwf1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a175ffc0d2ea17ad8c4faeeb8319e6711f5243\n\n**Quantum Dot Film for Superior Visuals**\n\nThe MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Rapid IPS panels, while the MAG 274QPF X30MV adopts a Rapid VA panel. All of them integrate Quantum Dot film to deliver an exceptional visual and gaming experience.\n\n\\- Rapid IPS / Rapid VA ensure ultra-fast response times, minimizing motion blur and delivering smooth gameplay.\n\n\\- Quantum Dot film expands the color gamut, producing richer, more vibrant colors for stunning image quality.\n\nTogether, they offer a perfect blend of speed, clarity, and color accuracy for both gamers and content creators.\n\n\n\n**Revolutionary Dual Mode for Ultimate Flexibility**\n\nBoth MPG 274URDFW E16M and MAG 274UPDF E16M feature Dual Mode, supporting:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 4K@160Hz for ultra-sharp visuals.\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FHD@320Hz for ultra-smooth gameplay.¬†\n\nTo make switching effortless, gamers can seamlessly move between AAA titles and competitive FPS games using MSI‚Äôs 5-way Navi Key, which allows them to toggle between two modes with a single click.\n\nMSI has also made Dual Mode smarter with AI Dual Mode. This feature detects resolution and refresh rate settings and automatically adjusts to the optimized refresh rate when switching. For example, if you set your monitor to 4K@120Hz, the FHD mode will automatically adjust to 240Hz instead of 320Hz, ensuring a balanced experience without extreme discrepancies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss8zsxuycdwf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3d7faf4171a7e6a1c0c02368dfb61ba6a323d5\n\nLearn more about Dual Mode and other AI features, please visit:\n\n[https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience](https://www.msi.com/blog/how-do-dual-mode-and-ai-menu-enhance-your-game-experience)\n\n¬†**Specification:**\n\n|Model|MPG 274URDFW E16M|MAG 274UPDF E16M|MAG 274QPF X30MV|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Size|27\"|27\"|27\"|\n|Resolution|UHD|UHD|WQHD|\n|Resfresh Rate|160Hz|160Hz|300Hz|\n|Dual Mode|FHD 320Hz|FHD 320Hz|N/A|\n|Panel|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid IPS with Mini-LED|Rapid VA with Mini-LED|\n|Local Dimming|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|1152 Zones|\n|Quantum Dot|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Brightness (nits)|SDR: 400 cd/m¬≤ HDR: 1000 cd/m¬≤ (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m¬≤ HDR: 1000 cd/m¬≤ (Peak) |SDR: 400 cd/m¬≤ HDR: 1000 cd/m¬≤ (Peak) |\n|HDR|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|VESA DisplayHDR 1000|\n|Response Time|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|0.5ms (GtG, Min.)|\n|Connectivity|1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI‚Ñ¢ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/98W PD, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x USB 2.0 Type-B |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI‚Ñ¢ 2.1 (UHD@160Hz), 1x Type-C (DP alt.) w/15W PD |1x DP1.4a (HBR3), 2x HDMI‚Ñ¢ 2.1 (WQHD@300Hz)|\n|Gaming Intelligence App|Support|N/A|N/A|\n|Firmware Update|Support|Support|Support|\n\nFor more information please visit the product pages.\n\nMPG 274URDFW E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-274URDFW-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274UPDF E16M: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274UPDF-E16M/)\n\nMAG 274QPF X30MV: [https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/](https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-274QPF-X30MV/)\n\n  \nRelease Date:\n\nThey are now available on the market in US.",

It's been completely adequate for how I use it. I just started getting back into playing PS5 and decided that I want something a little bigger (vertically) than what my ultrawide offers.\n\nI'v narrowed my search down to two monitors:\n\n1) Dell S3225QS (4K 120Hz VA)\n\n2) Samsung LS32DG502ENXZA (QHD 180Hz IPS)\n\nFor the life of me, I cannot decide which is the better option. I use my monitor primarily for productivity but also plan to start using it more for gaming. I like the idea of 4k, but I also like the idea of IPS. These are both \\~$300, which is really the most I want to spend for an upgrade. Regardless, both monitors would be a nice quality upgrade from what I have. For productivity, I work with a lot of documents, and, for PS5, I primarily play slower single player games (Lego games mostly but also enjoy Horizon and would like to eventually play Hogwarts Legacy).\n\nI keep reading polarizing opinions on both sides: QHD vs 4K and IPS vs VA.\n\nWould love any feedback anybody has!

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have this Samsung Odyssey G5 monitor (C34G55). \n\nI've had it already for maybe couple of years. However few days ago, I did some tweaks with contrast, brightness, sharpness settings by testing how it may improve image quality. After playing with those settigns for a bit the entire screen menu froze and didn't respond at all.\n\nSo, I decided to unplug and plug it back. And that did solve that particular frozen menu issue.\n\nHowever, shortly afterwards I've started to have issues with off timer setting. I made some investigation before writing in here and it appears that for some reason, now the screen seems to ignore if I set off timer to \"off\". And instead, it just picks the off timer's hours values no matter if off timer itself is off or on.\n\nFor example, if I set off timer to 1, and then afterwards set off timer to \"off\", screen will still enter a shutdown mode after 1h. Meaning I have to manually turn it back on.\n\n- I've tried to do factory reset.\n- I double checked that both \"off timer plus\" and \"eco timer\" are set to off. \n- I also did reset with unplug/plug and pressing power button 30sec. \n- I did firmware update through usb.\n\nAnd while I suspect the thing with frozen menu might have somehow affected my current issue, I still have had few rare occasions even before, where I experienced similar but not as \"permanent\" issues. Like screen not turning on, where I had to replug and unplug screen to make it work again.\n\nIt's not a fatal issue, but pretty anoying as I'm used that it turns automatically on when I wake my PC. I can of course set that \"off timer\" to 23h, but it'll still turn off randomly after 23h. So I'm just wondering, if any of you have or had similar issues and if you have found any fixes for that?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers.\n\n\n",

This monitor, or the Acer variant, could be a candidate to be my next one, however I don't see a lot of reviews about its 2D capabilities. I currently own an Acer Predator X27bmiphzx monitor, which is an IPS monitor with local dimming and quantum dot technology. I really like its HDR capabilities and very bright and vivid colors, although the white halo around bright objects on a dark background and black uniformity are issues, including the very noisy fan, the noisiest component of my PC . I wonder if the 3D monitors can achieve similar HDR performance and color performance.\n\nAny experience or opinions would be very valuable.\n\nThanks...",

While my current monitor is functional, it's starting to show signs of needing a long overdue retirement, such as flashing the logo for a while until it warms up when turning on on cold weather.\n\nI'm looking for something that can handle video editing, but also gaming. Video editing is what I do for a living, so that means at least 8 hours of my day is spent with Premiere, After Effects and Word open. At night, I'm usually either gaming, practicing/studying motion design in After Effects or watching something. \n\nIn case it's relevant: I typically deliver my videos on Rec. 709. I play games like Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Stardew Valley, Subnautica, Frostpunk, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, and so on. I very rarely play multiplayer shooters. \n\nFrom my research, I'm under impression that OLED wouldn't be a good option for me, because of the amount of static stuff for a long period while I'm working, so I have focused on IPS panels, with maximum size of 27\", with minimum resolution at 1440p.\n\nI'm not in the US, neither EU, so while there are plenty of options, it isn't the same as US or EU options. Some of the monitors I can get through Amazon, though. Or even Aliexpress. \n\nSome options I considered, but not feeling confident in buying: BenQ EX271, Asus VG259Q5A or VG27AQ5A or VG249QML5A, AOC 27G4/P, Acer Nitro XV273K, MSI MAG 274URFW. \n\nAre they good options? Would you go for one of them or are there better options? Or would you recommend something else? ",

I've seen OLEDs as a possibility, but as my main usage is programming and office work mixed with gaming, I'm not ready to invest so much into that and risk the chance of burn in.\n\nSo I went to look for MiniLED displays that fit my criteria. I'm mostly looking for 1000+ zones, 27'' 1440p (I don't think the upgrade to 4K is worth it) with around 240Hz so as to improve from my current one. The main upgrade would come from the backlight, where having true blacks shines (pun intended).\n\nI saw some offerings from KTC and AOC, but none had the ~240Hz, they were all 180Hz or so.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated. \n",

Simply replace the 24\" FHD with a new 27\" QHD monitor (refresh/response rates wouldn't really matter).\n2. Get a new 27\" monitor and use the Dell as the secondary monitor.  If I go this route then that leads to several questions.\n   1. Should I replace it with a 2k (same resolution) or 4K monitor?

Should I consider mini-led given my usage?\n\nAny advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

I have tried Radeon chill limited to min 60 fps and max 180 and its still there. I have HDR on but the flickering was an issue even before i had it on. The only solution is turning Adaptive Sync off, but i dont know if its worth it to have it off or on. Also read that it seems to be the monitors fault, since its a budget one (cost me 130 bucks). Is enhanced sync worth it instead with 180hz or should i lower my hz and test it so i can make Adaptive Sync work?",

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G64",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. \n\nI come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). \n\nA few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. \n\nFirst, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. \n\nMy perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". \n\nWith those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). \n\nThe cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. \n\nIf I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! \n\nFor any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!\n\nHere is a link for the same images in decent quality: [https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C](https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C)",

The question is, which monitor should I go for here, or should I keep my own?\n\nThe first option that I currently own is a Samsung Odyssey 1440p 144Hz 32‚Ä≥ QHD, while its nice, its a bit big for my desk and does look a little silly. Also I am concerned about Pixel density and if I am really getting the best image quality.\n\nThe second option is the Dell UltraSharp 27‚Ä≥ QHD 120 Hz. This would have less refresh rate compared to the Samsung one, but I'm wondering if it would give a better picture as the pixel density is higher. This would be ¬£390/$520. Making it free.\n\nThe third option is the more expensive Sony INZONE M10S (27‚Ä≥) OLED 1440p 480Hz monitor, which would be a significant upgrade but prices in around $1717.97 / ¬£1270, but essentially has a price of ¬£770/$1030.\n\nI am torn between either keeping my Samsung, or going for the Dell or Sony one. If I do go for the Sony one I'd be paying ¬£770/$1030 out of of pocket, but would end up with a better/ future proofed monitor. At that price point would it be obvious to get it?\n\nUsually I sit around an arms length away, I do a mix of gaming/productivity work.\n\nAny advice would be good.",

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G64",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. \n\nI come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). \n\nA few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. \n\nFirst, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. \n\nMy perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". \n\nWith those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). \n\nThe cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. \n\nIf I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! \n\nFor any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!\n\nHere is a link for the same images in decent quality: [https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C](https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C)",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have this Samsung Odyssey G5 monitor (C34G55). \n\nI've had it already for maybe couple of years. However few days ago, I did some tweaks with contrast, brightness, sharpness settings by testing how it may improve image quality. After playing with those settigns for a bit the entire screen menu froze and didn't respond at all.\n\nSo, I decided to unplug and plug it back. And that did solve that particular frozen menu issue.\n\nHowever, shortly afterwards I've started to have issues with off timer setting. I made some investigation before writing in here and it appears that for some reason, now the screen seems to ignore if I set off timer to \"off\". And instead, it just picks the off timer's hours values no matter if off timer itself is off or on.\n\nFor example, if I set off timer to 1, and then afterwards set off timer to \"off\", screen will still enter a shutdown mode after 1h. Meaning I have to manually turn it back on.\n\n- I've tried to do factory reset.\n- I double checked that both \"off timer plus\" and \"eco timer\" are set to off. \n- I also did reset with unplug/plug and pressing power button 30sec. \n- I did firmware update through usb.\n\nAnd while I suspect the thing with frozen menu might have somehow affected my current issue, I still have had few rare occasions even before, where I experienced similar but not as \"permanent\" issues. Like screen not turning on, where I had to replug and unplug screen to make it work again.\n\nIt's not a fatal issue, but pretty anoying as I'm used that it turns automatically on when I wake my PC. I can of course set that \"off timer\" to 23h, but it'll still turn off randomly after 23h. So I'm just wondering, if any of you have or had similar issues and if you have found any fixes for that?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers.\n\n\n",

But I know steep curves for work are a controversial topic. While I didn't love the 800r curve of the LG 34\" OLED I wasn't really hating it either (a lot of people didn't like the curve for work)\n\nIm not the biggest fan of a VA panel though, even this one seems like a faster one based on the review.\n\nHow do you guys feel about this one?

Work is a combination of coding, lots of database work, spreadsheets, email, etc.  The room has a lot of natural light during the day.  I really only play single player games and have never been bothered by the 165hz framerate.  My desktop PC has the following:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 7700x\n* RTX 4070 12 GB GPU\n* 32GB DDR5 memory.\n\nThe primary monitor (right in front of me) is a 27\" QHD Dell S2721DGF.  This is also the one that I use to occasionally play single player games.  My second monitor (to the right) is a 6+ year old Acer 24\" FHD 16:10 monitor.\n\nI wanted to upgrade the second monitor to a 27\" QHD or 4K display.  This leaves me with several options.\n\n1. Simply replace the 24\" FHD with a new 27\" QHD monitor (refresh/response rates wouldn't really matter).\n2. Get a new 27\" monitor and use the Dell as the secondary monitor.  If I go this route then that leads to several questions.\n   1. Should I replace it with a 2k (same resolution) or 4K monitor?  I'm a bit concerned that 27\" would be too small for 4k and that my setup wouldn't be adequate to play games on a 4k monitor\n   2. Should I consider mini-led given my usage?\n\nAny advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

It's been completely adequate for how I use it. I just started getting back into playing PS5 and decided that I want something a little bigger (vertically) than what my ultrawide offers.\n\nI'v narrowed my search down to two monitors:\n\n1) Dell S3225QS (4K 120Hz VA)\n\n2) Samsung LS32DG502ENXZA (QHD 180Hz IPS)\n\nFor the life of me, I cannot decide which is the better option. I use my monitor primarily for productivity but also plan to start using it more for gaming. I like the idea of 4k, but I also like the idea of IPS. These are both \\~$300, which is really the most I want to spend for an upgrade. Regardless, both monitors would be a nice quality upgrade from what I have. For productivity, I work with a lot of documents, and, for PS5, I primarily play slower single player games (Lego games mostly but also enjoy Horizon and would like to eventually play Hogwarts Legacy).\n\nI keep reading polarizing opinions on both sides: QHD vs 4K and IPS vs VA.\n\nWould love any feedback anybody has!

This monitor, or the Acer variant, could be a candidate to be my next one, however I don't see a lot of reviews about its 2D capabilities. I currently own an Acer Predator X27bmiphzx monitor, which is an IPS monitor with local dimming and quantum dot technology. I really like its HDR capabilities and very bright and vivid colors, although the white halo around bright objects on a dark background and black uniformity are issues, including the very noisy fan, the noisiest component of my PC . I wonder if the 3D monitors can achieve similar HDR performance and color performance.\n\nAny experience or opinions would be very valuable.\n\nThanks...",

While my current monitor is functional, it's starting to show signs of needing a long overdue retirement, such as flashing the logo for a while until it warms up when turning on on cold weather.\n\nI'm looking for something that can handle video editing, but also gaming. Video editing is what I do for a living, so that means at least 8 hours of my day is spent with Premiere, After Effects and Word open. At night, I'm usually either gaming, practicing/studying motion design in After Effects or watching something. \n\nIn case it's relevant: I typically deliver my videos on Rec. 709. I play games like Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Stardew Valley, Subnautica, Frostpunk, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, and so on. I very rarely play multiplayer shooters. \n\nFrom my research, I'm under impression that OLED wouldn't be a good option for me, because of the amount of static stuff for a long period while I'm working, so I have focused on IPS panels, with maximum size of 27\", with minimum resolution at 1440p.\n\nI'm not in the US, neither EU, so while there are plenty of options, it isn't the same as US or EU options. Some of the monitors I can get through Amazon, though. Or even Aliexpress. \n\nSome options I considered, but not feeling confident in buying: BenQ EX271, Asus VG259Q5A or VG27AQ5A or VG249QML5A, AOC 27G4/P, Acer Nitro XV273K, MSI MAG 274URFW. \n\nAre they good options?

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI‚Äôve been thinking about upgrading my setup and could use some opinions. I‚Äôve been on 1440p since the gtx 1080 days, and currently I‚Äôm using a Alienware 27 360hz 1440p OLED. It‚Äôs been awesome overall, but I‚Äôm starting to get that itch to go 4K ‚Äî either a 32-inch or maybe a 4K ultrawide OLED.\n\nThe thing is, I‚Äôm not sure how big of a jump it‚Äôll actually be coming from a high refresh 1440p OLED. Has anyone here made that switch? Was it worth it in terms of sharpness and clarity?\n\nAlso curious if there are any 4K OLED models I should stay away from. One thing I‚Äôve noticed with my Alienware is it can feel a bit dim during the day, but I guess that‚Äôs kind of the nature of OLED panels in general.\n\nI‚Äôve got a rtx 5080 so should have the horsepower for it.\n\n\nWould love to hear what you think ",

    "title": "Small review of TCL 25G64",
    "selftext": "Hi, I recently bought this monitor and I'm literally so happy with it that I just wanted to write a quick review in order to help anybody in doubt who doesn't know if this would be a good choice. \n\nI come from an LG 24GN65R, a humble 144Hz IPS monitor that never gave me a problem (I had calibrated it with Calibrite Display 123) and during its service I tried to switch a few times; I had bought a Minifire monitor and the famous AOC Q25G4SR (which I waited for a long time) and both went quite horribly so I returned them, mostly because of the viewing angles (but not only) which were really bad compared to my LG monitor. I also bought an OLED (XG27ACDNG) on last year's Black Friday but I returned that too mainly for two reasons: 1) the size (I tried 32\", 27\" QHD monitors and I just love the 24\" FHD combo, I find it to be absolutely perfect with my 4070 Super); 2) the fear of burn-in (I'm quite sure modern OLED monitors are well-equipped against it, but I was too scared of that). \n\nA few days ago I found this monitor on PC Componentes, bought it for ‚Ç¨170.40 which was an amazing deal (since Amazon is selling it for ‚Ç¨199). The monitor came without a single issue (backlight bleeding or dead/stuck pixels) luckily. As far as I remember from my short OLED experience, this monitor brings an experience insanely close to that. \n\nFirst, I want to say that straight out of the box the monitor is literally pre-calibrated: for context, I compared it to my old calibrated monitor and the colors were exactly the same but much much much more vibrant. I just had to change the color temperature for it to be perfect. \"Fast\" is the best for response time. Local dimming works amazingly both on High and Medium, I think Medium has a bit less blooming (like 10% less) and a little more contrast overall (5% more) both compared to High, in exchange High is like 5% \"brighter\" than Medium. I didn't like standard local dimming because it isn't bright at all. Blooming exists: if you put LD to High you can notice it, if you put it to Medium you notice it less. I have to say it doesn't give me a single problem and it's very soft and hard to notice to the eye. \n\nMy perfect settings are: FreeSync ON obviously, response time Fast, LD Medium, brightness 60 (depends on the light in your room basically), contrast 50 (default, don't touch it), sharpness 5 (default), gamma 1 (but I changed it slightly with Windows to match my preference), colors at \"Standard\", color temperature \"User 50/50/50\", color space \"Original\". \n\nWith those settings the monitor gives me an experience very very close to the OLED one I had one year ago: by words I can say the image is vivid just the same. The differences, if you're interested in OLED too, are: different response times (OLED has literally virtually 0 and you clearly notice it, on TCL it's very good though), infinite contrast compared to not-infinite contrast (but as you can see from the images I added the blacks are amazing and the images are very vivid), the main difference you can obviously notice are the viewing angles: the ones on OLED are completely perfect while the ones on TCL are very good but if you watch the monitor from the side you can clearly see the glow. On that point I want to firmly say that if you use the monitor correctly from the front you won't have a problem with viewing angles (I returned 2 monitors for that issue, so you can trust me). \n\nThe cons that I found are: no 10-bit at 300Hz as it only works on 240Hz, so you have to go 300Hz 8-bit (but I can't notice a difference anyway so it's not a problem for me); I don't like the fact that, unlike my old LG monitor, you can't turn off the joystick light (the one you use to access the monitor's menu) so at night it will switch from a static light blue to a static yellow (I repeat it's not a problem since the light is soft enough, but if you could have turned it off it would have been amazing). Lastly, I tested and didn't like the HDR as it delivers an image that is somehow washed out in my opinion, but I never used it and will never use it anyway so all good for me. \n\nIf I had to rate the monitor I would give it a 10 out of 10, considering the fact that I touched with my hands and tested an OLED one and other recent IPS models. It just works like an OLED with some minor caveats (but if you, like me, love the 24\" FHD combo, this is mandatory) and for a fraction of the price. Speaking of price, to me it should be much higher than what it is right now, so if you are wondering if you should buy it, I definitely suggest you to do so! \n\nFor any questions related to it feel free to ask; I'll leave some images of it just to let you see how nice the picture quality is!\n\nHere is a link for the same images in decent quality: [https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C](https://imgur.com/a/oDXcN5C)",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have this Samsung Odyssey G5 monitor (C34G55). \n\nI've had it already for maybe couple of years. However few days ago, I did some tweaks with contrast, brightness, sharpness settings by testing how it may improve image quality. After playing with those settigns for a bit the entire screen menu froze and didn't respond at all.\n\nSo, I decided to unplug and plug it back. And that did solve that particular frozen menu issue.\n\nHowever, shortly afterwards I've started to have issues with off timer setting. I made some investigation before writing in here and it appears that for some reason, now the screen seems to ignore if I set off timer to \"off\". And instead, it just picks the off timer's hours values no matter if off timer itself is off or on.\n\nFor example, if I set off timer to 1, and then afterwards set off timer to \"off\", screen will still enter a shutdown mode after 1h. Meaning I have to manually turn it back on.\n\n- I've tried to do factory reset.\n- I double checked that both \"off timer plus\" and \"eco timer\" are set to off. \n- I also did reset with unplug/plug and pressing power button 30sec. \n- I did firmware update through usb.\n\nAnd while I suspect the thing with frozen menu might have somehow affected my current issue, I still have had few rare occasions even before, where I experienced similar but not as \"permanent\" issues. Like screen not turning on, where I had to replug and unplug screen to make it work again.\n\nIt's not a fatal issue, but pretty anoying as I'm used that it turns automatically on when I wake my PC. I can of course set that \"off timer\" to 23h, but it'll still turn off randomly after 23h. So I'm just wondering, if any of you have or had similar issues and if you have found any fixes for that?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers.\n\n\n",

But I know steep curves for work are a controversial topic. While I didn't love the 800r curve of the LG 34\" OLED I wasn't really hating it either (a lot of people didn't like the curve for work)\n\nIm not the biggest fan of a VA panel though, even this one seems like a faster one based on the review.\n\nHow do you guys feel about this one?

Work is a combination of coding, lots of database work, spreadsheets, email, etc.  The room has a lot of natural light during the day.  I really only play single player games and have never been bothered by the 165hz framerate.  My desktop PC has the following:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 7700x\n* RTX 4070 12 GB GPU\n* 32GB DDR5 memory.\n\nThe primary monitor (right in front of me) is a 27\" QHD Dell S2721DGF.  This is also the one that I use to occasionally play single player games.  My second monitor (to the right) is a 6+ year old Acer 24\" FHD 16:10 monitor.\n\nI wanted to upgrade the second monitor to a 27\" QHD or 4K display.  This leaves me with several options.\n\n1. Simply replace the 24\" FHD with a new 27\" QHD monitor (refresh/response rates wouldn't really matter).\n2. Get a new 27\" monitor and use the Dell as the secondary monitor.  If I go this route then that leads to several questions.\n   1. Should I replace it with a 2k (same resolution) or 4K monitor?  I'm a bit concerned that 27\" would be too small for 4k and that my setup wouldn't be adequate to play games on a 4k monitor\n   2. Should I consider mini-led given my usage?\n\nAny advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I‚Äôve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of ‚Äúnever listen to audio equipment you can‚Äôt afford‚Äù had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show. ¬†Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn‚Äôt familiar with. They were both good ‚Äì the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.¬† However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge ‚Äì small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.¬† I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I‚Äôd never listened to before. It‚Äôs certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I‚Äôd given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there‚Äôs just something my ears don‚Äôt agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn‚Äôt spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn‚Äôt find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I‚Äôd have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI‚Äôve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.¬† There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.¬† My take away ‚Äì always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.¬† I really didn‚Äôt like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting ‚Äì a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it‚Äôs open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI‚Äôve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.¬† I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So‚Ä¶ I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre a bit less comfortable ‚Äì I main Grados. I‚Äôm used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn‚Äôt spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** ‚Äì they‚Äôre in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan‚Äôer (which I have a pair of ‚Äì they‚Äôre my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu‚Äôs sound signature. Detail-wise, they‚Äôre both about equals.¬† I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** ‚Äì a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them ‚Äì they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.¬† As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said ‚Äú you have to listen to this system‚Äù, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass ‚Äì exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn‚Äôt all that interested in them so didn‚Äôt try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn‚Äôt find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual ‚Äústudio‚Äù brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren‚Äôt there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, ¬£16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

Honestly? Yes, but as long as Im able to spend on it with my own hard work, and as long as they keep bringing me happiness, Ill keep going with it.\n\nLove this hobby and love the joy and experiences it brings with it :)",

I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn‚Äôt stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it‚Äôs no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they‚Äôd be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they‚Äôre better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they‚Äôre still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I‚Äôm really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an ‚Äúactive analog mode‚Äù which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you‚Äôre looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC‚Ä¶ look no further!",

Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

    "selftext": "I only wear ear clip headphones because I can't physically stand the in-ear ones, they just feel too ick for me personally. \n\nI've been using the wired Koss KSC75 for ages for walks/gym with great satisfaction, the ear clips are super comfortable for all day wear. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Koss-KSC75-Headphones-Lightweight-Grey/dp/B0FKHKQ22W\n\nFor my phone I used Bluetooth based ones. At first from lesser known brands with thick ear pieces, then eventually the Koss KSC35 with super thin ear pieces, which were great except the ear clips were a bit uncomfortable.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Koss-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-Microphone/dp/B082FP4PB3?sr=8-1\n\nI recently discovered the ear clips from the KSC75 and KSC35 are interchangeable, they just clip right off/on from each other. I was so happy, now I have the best of both worlds. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z1q9t6PAl2E?t=462\n\nAnother discovery I made is they seemed to have a new revision of the KSC35 they didn't advertise as new. My current ones, and model I bought as a gift just last year charge via Micro USB and are based on Bluetooth 4.2 with 6 hours of rated battery life on a full charge. They are now listed on Amazon as having USB-C charging, and Bluetooth 5.2 with 18 hours of rated battery life. \n\nJust bought them now, should arrive tomorrow, pretty excited.",

    "title": "Had an opportunity to try the LCD-X, & my comparisons to the Edition XS.",
    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisn√¶s Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

But would a somewhat lower 150 Ohm set like this still get a lot out of the WA3?

    "selftext": "\nI still remember it like it was yesterday‚Äîwalking into that audiophile shop in Paris and discovering the Grado 225e for the first time.\n\nI was blown away. Literally stood there with my mouth hanging open.\n\nThere were hundreds of headphones on display that day, but none of them came close to what the Grado delivered. The sound was *tactile* like you could reach out and touch the instrument itself. Everything felt tangible, organic, real. It wasn't processed or artificial; it was just... pure music in your hands.\n\nIt was love at first listen.\n\nBy pure chance, I ended up finding this tiny amplifier manufacturer, Alessandro, who was producing a custom Grado line to their own specs. I pulled the trigger, and here we are‚Äî 10 years later, and these cans are still with me.\n\nSure, they're not perfect. No headphone is. But with proper EQ tuning and some thoughtful modifications along the way, they've become an exceptional companion. The kind of headphones that make you fall in love with music all over again every time you put them on.\n\nTo anyone considering Grado: if you're looking for headphones that prioritize *musicality* over flashy marketing, that make you feel the performance rather than just hear it‚Äîdo yourself a favor and try them. \n\nWhat's your Grado story?",

They do seem to make them a bit less toasty (which was not a problem, but was noticeable with the stock pads for me). They also change the frequency response a bit, tilt it a bit to the high end, and open it up slightly. Not an improvement, for me, I like the warm, slightly more intimate feel of the stock pads a bit better, but not something that would stop me from using these either. Sound is still great. Edit: I had said that the sound isolation was not as good, but I am going back and forth now, and really, it is about the same. Also, going back and forth between the two, the sound difference really is minimal - it is there, but less then my initial impression. I don't hear much of a difference in bass either. I think the sound changes a little as the pads warm up, maybe the seal becomes a little better, and the differences, which are not much to begin with, decrease.\n\n Wondering what peoples impressions are, if anyone is still using these on their Maxwell? I am contemplating whether to keep them or not.",

My main focus, for this thread, though is just music listening. I have found that, for tracking/mixing/mastering, I can just use whatever headphones I have that like for casual listening, and I usually rotate through a bunch, as well as speakers, for studio work (I am not a pro, just do it for fun).  I I got rid of my DT770's and MDR-7506's, which I used for tracking and for mixing for years, and always hated (literally I have hated the 7506's for like 35 years now since the 90's, but I was comfortable using them, because I was familiar with the quirks). I also am jettisoning a couple of my less expensive (relatively) open backs, so I have a little room to play around. The two mentioned above, I absolutely despised for casual listening. No offense to those out there that love them for that, I am not criticizing anyone, I am just talking about what my personal preferences are.\n\nYou can see the set up I use for music listening and gaming at my desktop (I use the Audient iD14 for recording). For context, at present I am really enjoying the HD600, Arya Stealth V3, Focal Clear OG and Audeze Maxwell for music and gaming. I use  the FT1 for closed back duties, and actually it works great for all my needs.  So I feel well-situated, and am really experimenting for fun. I wanted to try out the Sony MDR-M1 because a youtuber who I really respect, who is a pro engineer, gave it a good review, and wanted to add a closed back to the arsenal. I am selling a BD Tygr and HD660S2, not because they are not great, just because I have not been using them as much, and I only can use a limited number, realistically.\n\nSo that's the background, sorry if that is a bit TMI. On to my impressions of the M1. I have been listening to it for about a week, for music listening and videogaming, mostly D4 at the moment. When I first popped them on I was a little disappointed, because they sounded a little gritty and forward in the mids and low trebles, especially vocals, guitars and cymbals. Slightly sibilant. I guess I have benefitted from some psychological burn in, perhaps, because after a day or two, the sound grew on me quite a bit. I still here those qualities a bit, but much reduced, and they don't detract from my enjoyment or  distract me anymore. The pros are the nice bass presentation, and ease of hearing everything in any mix (resolution and separation). I guess these are pretty neutral, in that the mids are not recessed, despite the robust bass presentation, and the highs are easy to hear, although there is some slight glare or grit in the upper mids and treble,  and also slight sibilance, like I said.\n\nOne pretty big con is the cables. There is a shorter and longer one, and the lengths and texture are great, no memory, not too heavy, a rubberoid/silicone sheath, which is very functional and pleasant, but not fancy. The problem is microphonic noise from friction, it is bad. I have not yet decided whether I am going to keep these or not, but I am leaning towards doing so, because I am liking the tuning more with use. They are particularly fun for D4, and probably other SPG's where immersive sound is appreciated. I don't do much FPS gaming at the moment, but these might be ok for that too, given the mid and low treble emphasis, as I perceive it anyway. The sort of gritty aspect to the upper mids seems to have partly dissipated, which is probably me just accommodating to the tuning - which, I should admit here, is very common for me. I usually need time to get into the tuning for whatever headphone or IEM when I first start using it.\n\nI am kind of curious about the open back sibling, the MDR-MV1, as well as what seems to be a similar product from Sennheiser, the HD490. I know none of these are flagship style or high end offerings, although I would not say they are cheap either, but I am pretty happy with my higher end sets for now. I am intrigued by the designs, rather than the tunings. The M1 is super light and comfy, and just disappears on the head. I think it is fair to say they are the most comfortable set I currently possess. They do get warm, as with any closed back setup with pleather pads. If you are sensitive to that, it would be a thing.\n\nI am wondering what other people's impressions of the MV1 are. I don't think I have seen other folks notice the mid/treble qualities that I seem to hear. The youtuber I mentioned described these as neutral, although I think some have described them as having a V-shaped tuning.  To me, these are not a classic V, because the mids are not recessed, even though the bass and lower treble are, let's say, also not recessed. But I am not an expert, by any means. I guess  that about wraps up my thoughts on this set for now, thanks for tolerating my ramblings.",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for a while now, and I have to say ‚Äî these things are incredible.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is warm and rich, but still very balanced and clear. Everything feels natural ‚Äî vocals, instruments, bass ‚Äî nothing is overdone or harsh. I haven‚Äôt noticed any distortion at all, even at higher volumes. The soundstage also surprised me; it‚Äôs natural and has a nice sense of depth and space between instruments. Music just feels alive through these, not flat or clinical.\n\nComfort:\nComfort is honestly next level. These feel like pillows hugging your head ‚Äî soft, snug, and super comfortable for long sessions. I wouldn‚Äôt use them for workouts (they‚Äôre not built for that kind of movement), but they‚Äôre fine for light activities like a brisk walk or some yoga.\n\nNoise Canceling & Transparency:\nThe noise canceling is phenomenal ‚Äî so strong it can actually get a little disorienting at first because it blocks everything. On the other hand, the transparency mode sounds incredibly natural. You can easily hear your surroundings without it sounding artificial, which is great if you‚Äôre in an office or just need to stay aware of people around you.\n\nControls & Features:\nThe controls take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out, they work really smoothly. I love that you can quickly switch between Bluetooth devices you‚Äôve already paired ‚Äî that‚Äôs super convenient. Battery life is great too ‚Äî around 30 hours, which easily gets me through multiple workdays or a long flight.\n\nThere‚Äôs also USB audio, multi-point Bluetooth, and spatial audio that works on any device, no special software needed. The call quality is excellent too; I‚Äôve taken business calls in noisy environments and people still hear me clearly.\n\nOverall:\nThese are some of the best headphones I‚Äôve ever owned. The sound, comfort, and noise canceling are all top-tier, and the features make them super versatile. They‚Äôre not for heavy workouts, but for travel, work, or just relaxing and enjoying your music, they‚Äôre absolutely worth it.\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

I thought high-end headphones were supposed to completely change how I hear music, but I didn‚Äôt notice much difference from my A50s besides a little better bass. I was convinced I‚Äôd just wasted a $1000\n\nStill, I figured I‚Äôd give them a few more days since I had a 30-day return window. Day two ‚Äî same story. Day three, same thing at first‚Ä¶ until I took a break and came back an hour later. I decided to give it one last shot and played Yellow by Coldplay. And holy fuck. It sounded incredible. I could hear details I‚Äôd never noticed before the clarity, the bass, everything. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.\n\nNext thing I know, I‚Äôm just sitting there for hours listening to everything I can find, completely hooked. Some songs even got me kinda emotional. Safe to say, I‚Äôm not returning anything anytime soon lol.",

    "title": "Frequency Response vs Sound Quality",
    "selftext": "First off, I am new to the headphone space so please excuse my lack of understanding.\n\nI have noticed that most reviewers, whether that's a review on YouTube, or an article on their website, place heavy emphasis on the frequency response curve. They will place this above all else when it comes to sound quality.\nFrom what I understand, frequency response curve is more indicative of a headphones 'sound signature' or what the manufacturer intended it to sound like but is not the only or imo main factor in the overall sound quality. \nFor example, when you compare a cheap pair of headphones to a more expensive one, no matter how well the cheap pair is tuned, it will still lack detail or resolution that the more expensive headphone will have (based on my experience). You might not hear the small variations in the artists vocals or the instruments. It can also lack clarity in the sound. \nSo, I feel, the frequency response curve is only one aspect of the overall sound quality, but there are many more things to consider and compare. You would expect an expensive pair of headphones to still sound 'better' even if it's not tuned closer to the Harman curve compared to a cheaper pair, just because of the better drivers, better materials and superior sound processing. \n\nIf so, why do reviews not talk about the rest of the factors affecting sound quality and focus almost purely on the sound signature, which to some extent can be fixed with an EQ, when the rest of it is not adjustable? \nSometimes they make it seem as if a well tuned $50 pair is better than a $400 pair which is better better build with better materials, with it's only shortcoming being a slightly worse tuning. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Or am I approaching this wrong?\nIs sound signature the defining factor in sound quality and listening experience or should we focus equally on things like clarity, resolution, ability to recreate the small variations in the sound, distortion?\nDo they avoid it because these other factors can't be quantified easily?

    "selftext": "I've tried pretty much every \"spatial audio\" VST and DSP out there, and 99% of it is garbage. Just weird tricks that sound fake. Recently I learned about convolution. I found the ASH-IR-Dataset and just started messing with room impulse files. Then I tried one called Calypso, and that was the first time it actually felt like I was sitting in a room, not listening to a weird effect. The next game-changer was headphone correction. You have to EQ your headphones to a diffuse-field target first. It makes the headphones neutral for the simulation to work on.\n\nThat's when I found the ASH-Toolset. It took me literal days of tweaking to get a sound that wasn't just \"good\" but correct. You have to learn the settings because the defaults probably won't work for you. The most critical part is the HRTF dataset (the \"dummy head\" recordings). You have to test them all (KEMAR, KU 100, etc.) Your ears are physically unique. The HRTF that's perfect for me will sound weird and wrong to you. If you don't find the one that anatomically clicks with your brain, you will never get that true \"in front of you\" sound.\n\nFor the first time in my life, music is actually in front of me, originating from a point in space outside my head. I'm now listening to music I've ignored for years (acoustic, live concerts, old rock) and it's more engaging than the metal I've lived on for 5 years, because I can hear the actual space in the recording. The effect is insane on my IEMs, super precise and immersive. On my HD 650s, it's also incredible, but the sense of space is wider and less \"in your face,\" a totally different but equally cool vibe. If you're tired of the gimmicks and want to hear what's really possible, this is the way.\n\n(I don't know English well, so I apologize if something is written incorrectly.)\n\nupd: I wrote a short instruction on how to start using the dataset - [https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurroundAudiophile/comments/1o9l4ni/comment/nk8imh0/)",

I decided to google what could be the cause, something led me to believe that the coil wire(?), the ultra thin varnished tiny wire was broken, so I opened it and sure enough it was. Replacement drivers are $192, I bought mine in 2022 for $550. New ones now cost $300\\~$350 depending on sales and such. So I was thinking is it even worth repairing at this point or just upgrade to better headphones. My choice that I landed on (kinda heavily at this stage) are the Meze 109 Pros. I am waiting for a sale for them as I've seen them as low as $628 or so, instead of the $750 they are right now (with coupon or something). I've seen a lot of reviews of these and lot's of people say these could be considered \"end game?\" for a lot of people. I am by no means an audiophile so fair enough in this case. Another thing I heard is the cable provided with these is kinda \"meh\" for the price of the headphones and suggestions seem to say to upgrade it. Not sure to what though.

The older pair has way more bass and depth to the sound while the new pair just sounds flat and needed a treble boost EQ to even sound vaguely normal. \n\nFor some reason they also have different charging ports. The older model has a Micro-USB while the new one has USB-C.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? Why are they different? What should I do next? And does anyone have any headphone recommendations so I'm not buying a worse version of the same headphones...again. (old pair are the first and second pics, new pair are the third and fourth)",

I like character ‚Äî not neutrality.\n\nMy first shortlist was Fostex TH900 Mk2 and Sony MRZ-1, but none were available.  \nI ended up getting the FatFreq Deuce ‚Äî the IEMs with the most powerful sub-bass I‚Äôve ever heard.\n\nThen the Virtuoso was announced, and after auditioning them twice, I finally added them to my collection.\n\n**Cons for first:**\n\nFor around $1000, you get a fancy case and Alcantara on the headband and pads.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I need some advice from the Audeze experts here. I'm about to buy a used LCD-X and I'm confused about which version it is.\n\n**The Facts:**\n\n* Serial Number: **7526658**\n* Purchased new: **March 10, 2021** from xxxx (authorized Swiss dealer)\n* Original invoice included\n* Current asking price: **\\~‚Ç¨850)** \\- seems like a good deal\n\n**The Confusion:** According to what I found online, LCD-X units with serial numbers **7527600 or higher** should be the 2021 revision. This one is 7526658, so technically *below* that threshold.\n\n**BUT** \\- and this is where it gets interesting - **the headphone has ALL the 2021 visual characteristics:**\n\n* ‚úÖ Modern suspension headband (not the old rigid design)\n* ‚úÖ Metal mesh grills (not fabric)\n* ‚úÖ New shiny leather earpads (not the old memory foam style)\n* ‚úÖ Overall 2021 aesthetic\n\nThe seller confirms **everything is original** \\- nothing has been replaced or upgraded. He bought it exactly like this in March 2021.\n\n**My Theory:** Could this be an early 2021 production unit or a transition model for the European market? Maybe Audeze started the 2021 revision slightly before the \"official\" serial number threshold, especially for international markets?\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone seen LCD-X units with 2021 components but serial numbers below 7527600?\n2. Do you think this is actually a 2021 model that just happened to get an earlier serial number?\n3. At 850 EUROS with all 2021 components visible, is this a no-brainer purchase even if there's uncertainty?\n\nI've contacted Audeze support but thought I'd ask the community too. Any insights would be really appreciated!\n\n**TL;DR:** LCD-X serial 7526658 (below 2021 threshold) but has all 2021 physical features. Bought new March 2021. Is it a 2021 model? Worth buying at ‚Ç¨850?",

    "title": "Trying to further my understanding of headphone power needs",
    "selftext": "I made a post in HeadohonesAdvice recently asking about the plausibility of running a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 off a dongle dac. At least half of the purpose of me asking is to learn more about the technical side of this audio technology, because I love learning and I have a strong desire to understand how things work. Having a strong base of knowledge can make me a more informed consumer if nothing else. \n\nThe responses ranged from ‚Äúno dongle will really provide enough power to run those headphones properly, even if it sounds loud enough‚Äù to ‚Äúamps are snake oil, don‚Äôt waste your money, just use an Apple dongle or, if you really want to blast it, get a fiio ka11 or something.‚Äù\n\nI found it truly interesting that both sides of this argument vehemently insist they are correct, which leads me to believe the science that goes into answering a question like this must be very nuanced and not at all black and white. \n\nStarting with the ‚Äúwhy volume doesn‚Äôt always mean enough power‚Äù argument, the best explanation I could find is that dynamic drivers don‚Äôt have consistent voltage needs across the entire audio spectrum. More specifically, the bass and upper treble have more power needs, and that power form what I‚Äôve gathered is voltage for volume and current for driver control. I may be oversimplifying or possibly just wrong so forgive me, but the broader point is that even if the sound in general sounds loud enough and is therefore getting enough power, parts of the frequency response might not be getting what they need especially when it comes to music with a lot of dynamic range or large peaks in volume. The idea here is that ‚Äúit sounds loud enough to me‚Äù could be an incomplete picture. \n\nOn the other side of the argument I‚Äôm seeing that the above argument is a hypothetical and over complicated concern, that for a high-impedance set like the HD 600 if you can get it loud enough for normal listening then you are supplying it with all the power it needs since voltage equals volume and voltage is the main concern with a headphone like this (as opposed to a set that has low impedance but high current needs). Even Crinacle, a popular figure in the audiophile space, claims that something like the ka11 can provide ‚Äúway too much power‚Äù and could easily run a set of HD 800s at ‚Äúear-splitting volume‚Äù.  Not that his word is gold, or anything, but he still strikes me as someone with a lot of experience and knowledge. \n\nMeanwhile back on the other side again, you can look up power calculators for headphones that more or less verify most dongles won‚Äôt be able to supply the necessary voltage or current for high impedance headphones to run at max potential/without clipping part of the frequency response. \n\nApologies for the wall of text here, I just wanted to provide context for the rabbit hole I‚Äôm going down. I should make it clear I‚Äôm not ‚Äúworried‚Äù about this, I‚Äôm perfectly happy to enjoy my headphones and my music without wringing my hands worrying if I‚Äôm doing it properly. This is purely because I want to learn. I like learning. It‚Äôs that simple. And in service of that, I‚Äôd be interested to hear more detailed information on either side of this argument. Correct me where I‚Äôm wrong, elaborate where I‚Äôm oversimplifying, provide additional context I might not be considering. The folks here seem passionate and knowledgeable and I would be grateful if any of you would be willing to share your wisdom with me in the name of learning new things!",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.¬† As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I‚Äôve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of ‚Äúnever listen to audio equipment you can‚Äôt afford‚Äù had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show. ¬†Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn‚Äôt familiar with. They were both good ‚Äì the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.¬† However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge ‚Äì small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.¬† I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I‚Äôd never listened to before. It‚Äôs certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I‚Äôd given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there‚Äôs just something my ears don‚Äôt agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn‚Äôt spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn‚Äôt find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I‚Äôd have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI‚Äôve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.¬† There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.¬† My take away ‚Äì always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.¬† I really didn‚Äôt like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting ‚Äì a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it‚Äôs open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI‚Äôve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.¬† I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So‚Ä¶ I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre a bit less comfortable ‚Äì I main Grados. I‚Äôm used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn‚Äôt spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** ‚Äì they‚Äôre in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan‚Äôer (which I have a pair of ‚Äì they‚Äôre my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu‚Äôs sound signature. Detail-wise, they‚Äôre both about equals.¬† I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** ‚Äì a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them ‚Äì they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.¬† As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said ‚Äú you have to listen to this system‚Äù, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass ‚Äì exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn‚Äôt all that interested in them so didn‚Äôt try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn‚Äôt find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual ‚Äústudio‚Äù brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren‚Äôt there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

    "title": "DCA E3 to Noire X - less gap than Utopia OG to Clear OG in my mind",
    "selftext": "I've given in to my own curiosity and obtained the E3 just now. I am not a trained reviewer or anything, and this is 30 minutes in, so bear with me. I have tested them so far with Qudelix-5K, and Fiio K19, Fiio K17.\n\n* The biggest reason to consider E3 is the comfort factor. The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such. (Although this may not be so clear-cut as the heavier weight can be felt, making the pressure on the head something to think about too)\n* You really aren't missing much with Noire X, whether it'd be in terms of build, the whole signature. The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, ¬£16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

    "title": "These are some Ultralight Studio Headphones I designed",
    "selftext": "This is my project headphone for my high school design course.\n\nIt needed to fit the following criteria:\n\n* comfortable for long hours with ultralight weight construction\n* sound quality on par with other reference/studio headphones\n* priced relatively affordable compared to the market\n\n**specs:**\n\n* Driver: Peerless 50 mm driver\n* mass: 170g (without cable)\n* materials:\n   * earcups: PLA-LW and PLA\n   * headband strap: Faux leather\n   * earpad: aliexpress 110mm hybrid velour\n   * everything else: PETG\n* Connection: dual 3.5mm\n\n**Comfort**\n\nBeing 170 grams already makes this a comfortable headphone; it feels weightless on the head. Some gripes I do have are that the earpads are not the most comfortable, *but then again I have massive ears*, so 110 mm earpads should be fine for most.\n\n**Sound**\n\nThese have some great soundstage, on par with HD800s but a bit more airy. Tuning is not perfect, upper ranges are sharper than I would prefer. The small sub bass boost at around 50Hz is great especially with the recessed mid bass that creates a really clean sound signature. \n\nWill definitely need some second opinions on this.\n\n**Price**\n\nThe target price is around $150-$200 AUD (\\~$100-$130 USD) with a cable. Without a cable its around $125 AUD ($80 USD). Quite good value if I price it around there (or maybe open source???).\n\n*Production price is around $100 AUD ($65 USD) btw.*\n\n**Improvements**\n\nI will be adding a headband suspension system for headband auto-adjust and experimenting with other earpads.\n\nTuning is going to be tweaked, needs a more consistent sound signature + less treble.\n\nThe headphone is also really fragile, so I need to fix that.\n\nThis headphone also needs a name.\n\n(also no files yet, my Autodesk fusion file is spaghetti)  \n",

    "selftext": "I'm potentially in the market for my first pair of earbuds and I had a few questions I was hoping y'all could help with. I have nice headphones I like very much (660s2) and am now trying to dabble in something more portable. Sorry for the wall of text...\n\n\\-After the recent firmware update, do the airpods pro 3 now sound as good or better than the 2? I know that nearly everyone universally said that the airpods pro 2 sounded great and that they were a genuinely good product. \n\n\\-When people say that the airpods pro 2 had great sound, could they compete with other earbuds like the technics az100, pi8, Bose, etc. or was it just that the sound signature was inoffensive and this made them a great all-rounder? I ask because it seems like, ironically, the airpods aren't spoken about too much over on the earbuds reddit so I wonder if they are simply inferior in terms of sound quality compared to other options (people complain about the codec, for example). Do a lot of other products cream the airpods on sound or is it more modest than that? I would obviously expect that a product double the price like the pi8 to sound better but I'm not sure if diminishing returns in the earbuds world are as real.\n\n\\-If I care about mostly listening to music on the go, IEMs (or closed-backs) will blow any earbuds out of the water, right? The IEM market is super saturated and I know nothing about them, even in regards to the ways in which they do or do not stack up to headphones (that's a whole different beast).\n\nPS: I have an iphone.",

    "selftext": "* Headphones: Susvara\n* Amp: Cayin HA-300MK2\n* Tubes: Western Electric 300b and CV6 Mullard White Prints\n* Dac: Holo May\n* Upsampling: HQ Player to DSD 512\n\nLove this setup, easily the best I have ever listened to. Originally started with a Topping D90 and A90 setup, and while it felt like they could power the Susvaras fine, I realized at some point months had gone by without using them, so something was missing.\n\nSo I took my headphones to an audio show in Tampa and tried a bunch of amps with them in search of a stack that would give a feeling of not wanting to take my headphones off. Trying a bunch of combos, I eventually landed on a Cayin HA-6a amp and was blown away. Listening to Daft Punks Alive 2007 album and you feel like you are at the concert. The soundstage really blows up for the Susvara on a proper tube setup.\n\nSo I found a nice deal on a used Cayin 300b tube amp, and down the tube rabbit hole I went. Luckily the folks on head-fi have already gone down this hole so I didn't have to go far before landing on an optimal tube combo setup thanks to some advice over there.\n\n**AMP:**\n\nFor the upgrades, the amp and tube changes made the biggest difference in sound along with HQ Player setup (which is seriously a pain to setup, but well worth the effort). BTW Tube rolling is really cool, it's amazing how changing a set of tubes can change the sound of your headphones so drastically. The other thing is alot of these tubes are NOS (new old stock) meaning they are old AF. So you get them from ebay sellers in these boxes from the 40's basically crumbling at the touch. It's just cool, feels like a bit of history is powering my headphones right now :'D.\n\n**DAC + HQ Player:**\n\nOverall I would say the Holo May is the least noticeable improvement in sound, and given the price makes it a poor investment. If I could go back in time, I would consider one of Holos cheaper models so I could still get NOS and run HQPlayer. If you don't, NOS mode means it doesn't apply any oversampling to the music, which most dacs do by default. So you hear the music exactly as it comes. This usually softens the character of the music and reduces sibilance. Additionally and this is the key feature, it lets you use **HQPlayer** to choose your own oversampling algorithm. So now I have my music running through a server with some GPU's in it doing some crazy powerful oversampling that could never be done by normal DAC on it's own.  This gives a huge upgrade in sound clarity and detail.\n\n  \nIn terms of performance gains I would rate as:\n\nHeadphones > Amp > Tubes > HQ Player > Dac",

    "selftext": "I currently have some HD595 that I've had for probably about 15-20 years (got them as couldn't quite afford the HD600 at the time). They were the first pair of \"proper\" headphones I owned (and the only ones I've owned since apart from various Sony/Cambridge Audio bluetooth ones). I went into Richer Sounds today to see what they had Sennheiser wise. They didn't have the 600 but had 650's and as well as the 800s.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to demo the 800s, to which I said yes immediately (connected to a Cambridge Audio Evo150). Comfort was immediate and the pads were larger than I was used to (weren't as close around the ears as the 595's).  I tried them with some various types of music I like (some Hans Zimmer, Queen, Prodigy, Public Service Broadcasting) and was loving everything I was hearing. As they were shop demo phones, they'd obviously been run in over time. \n\nI loved the soundstage, it wasn't too heavy on bass, but had enough where needed. As I listen to quite a wide range of music, I know the Sennheiser's suit me as they're known for being quite neutral (from everything I read).\n\nI then asked how much they were - and was told ¬£1200/$1600. They were beautiful headphones and sounded great to me but that is way more than I'd ever be able to afford. I'm not unhappy with my 595's but have seen what the higher end phones are like - even if all I can ever do is demo them. There could be other brands/phones that are considered just as good/better but these would be my current end-goal if the lottery numbers came in.",

    "selftext": "So, I‚Äôve been trying to find a set of cans I can enjoy comfortably in my home and also use in the go while traveling.  I started with the usual ANC suspects (Bose, Sony, Apple) and while appreciated the ANC, I just really couldn‚Äôt stand the fidelity of my music either them.  \nI had been using a pair of DCA E3 at home and just love the sound and comfort and decided to try and take them on the go, but found that without ANC, it was really hard to find a way to drive them loud enough that I could overcome the plane/train noise.  I mean they have decent passive isolation, but it‚Äôs no match for ANC.\nAnyway, I came to this forum and asked for some suggestions and many people recommended the Focal Bathys. I went and listened to them and was unimpressed with their musicality (again, I think the E3s may be the greatest closed back cans ever made), but decided to order a set of Bathys Mg, figuring at the additional cost, maybe they‚Äôd be much closer to what I was looking for.  \nWell, I have to tell you that I was even more unimpressed.  I mean, yes they‚Äôre better than the Bathys, but even with good PEQ, they‚Äôre still only middle of the road and definitely not worth the uptick in price over the standard Bathys.\nI was about to give up and just see about getting a really nice DAC that put out a lot of power (like the Cayin RU9 or iBasso PB6) and go back to the E3s but then came across the T+A Solitaire T.\nWow, I‚Äôm really blown away.  Sound almost as good as the E3s, ANC about as good as the Bathys (which us to say ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù) and they have a completely passive mode so they can be used wired without turning on and wasting battery (but also have an ‚Äúactive analog mode‚Äù which just drives them to be ever so slightly better).\nI just needed to give you all my impressions and thank everyone for their help in finding them in the first place.  If you‚Äôre looking for an outstanding pair of wired/wireless cans with ANC‚Ä¶ look no further!",

    "title": "Had an opportunity to try the LCD-X, & my comparisons to the Edition XS.",
    "selftext": "For context, I daily drive both HD 6XX & Edition XS, both fantastic headphones at their price points and offer a nice yin-yang depending on what my mood is. When it comes to the LCD-X though, boy these *really* threw me for a loop. All tracks were at least MP3 320/FLAC (44.1 Khz).\n\n***Build & Comfort:***\n\nThe moment I put them on, I realized how much better they were in build quality compared to **both** my daily drivers. **But,** this comes at a cost of comfort, the LCD-X are seriously bulky and cumbersome. I demoed them for about 2 hours and felt myself constantly re-adjusting them on my head, their weight certainly didn't help either. Another concern the LCD-X have over the XS is how small the pads are, my ears were uncomfortably resting on them whereas with the XS, this would never be a concern.\n\n**Edition XS win this for me.** They're lighter, have larger pads, ***BUT*** are certainly not nearly as well made. Pick and choose I suppose.\n\n***Sound:***\n\nUnlike the Edition XS, the LCD-X didn't immediately \"wow\" me, instead they lulled me on an audio journey I've certainly never experienced before.\n\nRight off the bat, the LCD-X were instantly more natural sounding, the timbre being so much more life-like, realistic. Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" blew me away with them, his vocals stood front-stage, seriously felt like I was live in the studio with him. The Edition XS not too far behind, though it's certainly missing a lot of that natural timbre the LCD-X have. Another huge plus on the LCD-X was how well represented the mid-range felt, less cluttered than the XS - detail retrieval was off the charts.\n\nTwo things the Edition XS does better though, is soundstage and (maybe) imaging. Certain tracks, like for example Flukt Del 1 by Knut Riisn√¶s Quartet, certainly felt more open & I could somewhat pick out some instruments better on the XS compared to the LCD-X. Though again, the LCD-X felt closer to the listener, less soundstage, more of a lush, natural mid-range on the same track.\n\n**With a slight edge in most tracks, LCD-X won the sound game.** More rich, more detailed - but the XS were not far behind!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n**Honestly**, I am blown away that my Edition XS, a headphone that (was) less-than half the cost of the LCD-X at the time I bought them (for $350, couple years ago), is able to stand up against the LCD-X at their $1200 price tag. The sound/build difference IS distinguishable, though it really depends on what track I was demo-ing.\n\nAre they worth the price? Honestly...it depends. The two headphones really do sound so much different, the Edition XS are much wider, brighter, and more energetic in tonality, where the LCD-X are much more closed in, more natural, and a tad bit warmer than the former. If you have the money, the LCD-X are certainly worth it, but if you wanna save some for a nice DAC/AMP, HiFiman can't really disappoint!",

    "title": "I attended Toronto Audio Fest 2025 this past weekend, here are some thoughts on the headphones there.",
    "selftext": "Toronto Audio Fest is an audiophile convention that happens yearly, out in a hotel beside Pearson International Airport in Toronto.¬† As I understand it, in previous years there were always some headphone vendors, but this year the organizers went a bit further in this direction and created a dedicated couple of rooms (two were actually corridors) to nothing but headphones and IEMS. I was only able to attend on the Friday (sadly missing meeting John Grado and seeing their new Signature S750, both of whom were there on Saturday), but got to try many headphones that I‚Äôve always wanted to try. As a bonus, my usual rule of ‚Äúnever listen to audio equipment you can‚Äôt afford‚Äù had to be suspended for the day, and I also listened to half-million dollar stereos in the rest of the show. ¬†Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Grado:**\n\nTheir distributor (distributors seemed to run most if not all of the booths) had a small selection of Grados to try (no 125 or RS2 for example), but their newer cans with the removable cables (**HP100se** and **S950**) were the ones I wasn‚Äôt familiar with. They were both good ‚Äì the HP100 had a more neutral sound signature, and the 950 was smoother.¬† However, for the price, I still prefer my old 325is.\n\n**Sennheiser:**\n\nOld mate Senn had the best booth of the show. Actually, it was more of a lounge ‚Äì small tables with **HD800s, HD820s, HD660S2s,** and a few more I forget, with plush couches to sit back on.¬† I ended up here several times during the day to rest my feet, and got a lot of casual time in with the 800s, which I‚Äôd never listened to before. It‚Äôs certainly got a unique presentation. Airy, spacious and relaxing, and stupidly comfortable.\n\n**Fiio:**\n\nI was really looking forward to the **FT1 Pro**. I‚Äôd given them a listen to before at Bay Bloor Radio a couple months ago, and gave them another here. I really should like these, but there‚Äôs just something my ears don‚Äôt agree with.\n\n**Stax:**\n\nI didn‚Äôt spend much time here, but got to try the **SR-L500** and **SR-007S**. As my first experience with electrostats, they were very good, but I didn‚Äôt find them much better than all the planars in the same room. I think I‚Äôd have to listen to them in a more quiet room to appreciate the sound fully.\n\n**Audeze:**\n\nI‚Äôve always wanted to try these. They were the planars that made planars popular, after all.¬† There was a big selection across their whole range, at the show, and the ones I gave good time to were the **LCD-X**, **LCD-3** and **Maxwell**.¬† My take away ‚Äì always go out of your way to listen to expensive headphones before taking the plunge.¬† I really didn‚Äôt like the sound signature of the X, and the pair I tried had shouty upper mids during female vocals, which was weird for such a pricey pair. I much preferred the LCD-3s, which was much tamer in that regard. The Maxwells were interesting ‚Äì a high-end planar Bluetooth set?! Sounded great over LDAC, with a much warmer sound signature than it‚Äôs open-backed ancestors.\n\n**Hifiman:**\n\nI‚Äôve always been curious about trying **Hifiman** cans, but never had the opportunity, so I was very glad that Hifiman Canada was at the show.¬† I got to try their **Shangri-la**, which is an absolutely bonkers amp/electrostat pair, seemingly (to me at least) inspired by the Sennheiser HE1, but only a little less over-the-top. Of the others I tried, the **Edition XV** and Sundara stood out. The Edition XV had a nice soundstage and very open feel. Also, it was super comfortable. The big surprise of the show was the **Sundara**. I loved it! The sound signature was entirely up my alley, the sound staging and details in the same class as the Editions, and the price was right. So‚Ä¶ I ordered a pair. Should get here tomorrow. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre a bit less comfortable ‚Äì I main Grados. I‚Äôm used to it.\n\n**IEMs:**\n\nDidn‚Äôt spend too much time with IEMs, but there was one distributor there who carried a lot of moondrop and similar. I tried the **Chu 2s** ‚Äì they‚Äôre in the same insanely affordable price bracket as the Wan‚Äôer (which I have a pair of ‚Äì they‚Äôre my backup buds), and I have to say I almost prefer the Chu‚Äôs sound signature. Detail-wise, they‚Äôre both about equals.¬† I also tried the **Melody Wings Venus** ‚Äì a pretty obscure pair in the $250CAD realm. I have to say I really liked them ‚Äì they had a very approachable and easy sound signature, reminding me of the KZ PRX, with a bit of the bass trimmed in slightly.\n\n**Princess Pasta Audio:**\n\nAn odd booth. These guys are an online store? One of them is from Sault Ste. Marie. And they had an extremely eclectic collection of great with them, some for sale, some for demo. From a couple wireless Koss Porta Pros, to Geshelli amps, to a couple really distinctive headphones. Of note was the **Aune AR7000**, a closed-back multi-driver pair- one planar and one dynamic in each ear. It sounded much more open than other closed-backs.¬† As I was leaving, one of the guys from the booth said ‚Äú you have to listen to this system‚Äù, and beaconed me to sit in a comfy chair, handing me a pair of **Mod House Audio Tungstens**. These are rare, made-to-order headphones, and they were running on a system with a Holo Audio RED streamer, Geshelli Eirish 3 being used as a preamp, and an Orchard Audio Valencia as a headphone power amp of sorts. I was given a good length of time with them, and was absolutely floored. I had absolutely no complaints. The sound signature, perfect. The bass ‚Äì exactly where I like it. Highs? Crisp and detailed without a trace of sibilance. Their comfort? Unparallelled. These were the perfect headphones. The only downside? About $2200 plus 6 months lead time for the cans, and significantly more for the rest of the equipment hehe.\n\n**Missing brands:**\n\nFirstly Audio-Technica had a booth but I wasn‚Äôt all that interested in them so didn‚Äôt try any. Meze supposedly had representation at the show but I couldn‚Äôt find them. A shame, I was really looking forward to trying the Poets. Also, being an audiophile show, the usual ‚Äústudio‚Äù brands like Beyerdynamic and Sony weren‚Äôt there.\n\nIn all, I'm very glad I went, and hope it grows in coming years.",

The larger ear cups allow for even better pressure distribution around the ears and your ears can fit in even more easily, and they may be better for long duration listening as such.

The width of the E3 is wider than Noire X, but it made me think of how Utopia OG is wider than Clear OG, when both of them aren't very wide in the first place. It's basically a slightly bigger recording booth.\n* As DMS noted, Noire X does run a touch hotter in trebles, with a hair faster bass decay. I find myself needing to nitpick since they are far more similar than they are different in overall presentation. Macrodynamics are comparable, with neither being monsters in the category, but are better than prior Aeon series.\n* Portability wise, E3 is heavier, but they fold up to nearly the same physical volume as Noire X. They do need more juice, but not alarmingly so.\n* Fingerprint magnet factor wise, I think NX may be even worse as that piano black is even harder to baby than the gorilla glass on the E3.\n* I will not call the Noire X as an Elex, nor will I call E3 a Clear OG, as the gap between the two is less than that. There is no 'premium build' factor to differentiate between E3 and Noire X, as DCA didn't skimp for Noire X. You can argue that maybe for the Vivo versus the Dummer cable, but that's pulling hairs.",

I will be using these often.\n\nThe balanced cable was off Amazon by Janjunsi, ¬£16, really nice quality that feels more premium than cables I've bought before at over 4x the price.\n\nIt's good to be back.",

Right now whenever I move the computer directly to the PC and hol it up it's just a pain and nothing feels seamless. \n\nWhat are y'alls experience doing the same? \n\nIs this a good product for essentially a more open Nintendo switch with an emphasis on docked mode? Is there something else I should be considering?",

Now a month later cloud sync just turned itself back on for the game and overwrote all of my saves I had with the cloud synced ones from a month ago. This was a ton of game time. I opened where my saves are in desktop mode and all I see there is the cloud saves that are from like a month ago. \n\nThis completely sucks. I was all but completely done with the game as of a few days ago when I last played. \n\nIs there any other area the saves could be at or any way of recovering the data? I've tried turning cloud saves back on or off and rebooting the SD a few times but it's not helped a thing. My characters are like 40 levels behind where they were. Pretty much half my gameplay has been lost. ",

    "selftext": "The most frustrating bugs are the ones that only occur sometimes, and can't be perfectly recreated. \n\nAfter casually looking through the Internet for months, I've never found this specific issue discussed:\n\nWhen remote playing Fallout 76 via SteamDeck, everything works flawlessly when I'm playing on the console. \n\nHowever, when using a controller (Bluetooth, USB, or 2.4ghz receiver), the controller only works about 75% of the time.  The game is fully controller-compatible, and works without issue 100% on the PC itself. \n\nThis isn't to say the controller disconnects or lags, what I mean is that the main menu of the game, the controller either works or it doesn't. It's like the game rolls the dice whether it will accept the controller as an input method or not. This is only an issue when remote playing with an external controller. Sometimes closing/reopening the game fixes the issue, sometimes it doesn't. \n\nDoes anyone have this same experience with any games? Every time I tweak something and the controller works, I think I have found the solution, but then it won't work next time. \n\nI'm looking for anything. For example, I recently just learned that while remote playing \"Hogwarts Legacy\" on SteamDeck with a controller, you have to disable the steamdeck's own left joystick for the controller to behave correctly in menus.\n\nEven if it's something that obscure, I'm hoping to find a consistent solution. \n\nThanks!  Maybe someone on here has some insight as to how different input methods work, and why they would be different during remote play. ",

There‚Äôs just something so nice about being able to play what I want no matter where I am. With the expansion of it being a computer too, I can emulate games or just tinker with my system, opening a whole new world of things I can do. \n\nSo, if you can, get a steam deck.

A few weeks later, the left one stopped working too. As in no motion or pressure detected in the Test Controller tool.\n\nHere's what I've done so far to fix the issue (not all in one go):\n\n1. Restarted in Game Mode\n2. Went to Desktop Mode and installed all updates\n3. Restarted in Desktop Mode\n4. Entered BIOS (even here the trackpads were unresponsive) and enabled Battery Storage Mode\n5. Reset controller settings by holding Quick Access + volume down button.\n6. Reset controller settings to default in the settings\n7. Used Repair OS tool in the settings\n8. Factory Reset \n\nAll proved to be ineffective.\n\nThe trackpads used to work without any issues before the right one first stopped working. The most \"explorative\" thing I did with my deck was install Retrodeck but I never actually got it working or loaded any ROMs so it was just empty. Also installed CachyOS to be able to run WuWa before Steam officially added support.\n\nI've had my Steam Deck since Nov last year. I didn't really play games that heavily use trackpads either so now I'm just honestly confused about what triggered the issue.\n\nYou might be wondering why it took me four months to post here. I didn't want to Factory Reset my deck until I had backed up all my media and just didn't have the time to deal with that until recently. That didn't fix it as well hence this post.\n\nOn top of all that, I live in a SEA country where it's really hard to find shops that repair steam decks, if there even is any.\n\nIf anyone has experienced this issue or something similar and solved it, kindly drop your solutions below. Thank you. :(",

    "selftext": "My steam deck keeps waking up without me pushing the button. My first short term fix was to just shut down, so I know it wasn't a hardware issue. I looked around on here and some people suggest turning off Bluetooth. And that works for me.\n\nBut I mostly play docked. And I only use my xbox one controller. So I have no idea what wakes it up. I checked the blue tooth and nothing is connected. Ive connected headphones before but they are not on or connected now. It's very annoying. I basically have to turn blue tooth off and then push sleep(instead of doing it via my controller).\n\nAny help would be appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "Hello! I‚Äôve been lurking in this community since I got my steam deck last year when I was 21. The main driving force behind me getting a steam deck was because I simply have no room for a PC desk set up right now. A big reason for me picking one up is because many people praised the device for its emulation capabilities. I became obsessed with the deck when I first got it. (I have a 512gb Oled with a 512sd card) it was so beautiful! And just the sheer knowledge of knowing that any game I bought from steam would follow me to my ultimate goal of owning a PC, made me addicted. I got so wrapped up in playing FF7 and Dave the Diver that emulation completely slipped my mind until almost 1 whole year later. Now I‚Äôm feeling a little bit of FOMO for the switch 2, and a little jealous that they get Mario Galaxy 1 & 2. Then it hit me, I could just emulate it. After setting up emu deck I realized that for a whole year I was just scratching the surface on this thing. It surprises me all the time! Also Quick Resume saves my life‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I can get another device if it doesn‚Äôt have it. I need my little steam deck reward between chores. What‚Äôs a steam deck feature that never ceases to amaze you? ",

(Besides installing some games from my steam library)\n\nI‚Äôve already transferred my Roms to a micro SD card in preparation for installing EmuDeck for emulation. But I was wondering if I should install other stuff like Decky (I‚Äôve heard a lot of conflicting reports about it recently)\n\nLike I said this is my first SteamDeck so would love to hear if there are is any other stuff I should install or look into to help optimise the experience? Look forward to hearing some suggestions!",

    "selftext": "The biggest selling point for purchasing my Steam Deck was the promise of quality gyro aiming in any game I wanted through \"Steam Inputs\" that the device can reasonably support. The Deck, has not disappointed in that regard. It has made so many action shooters I've played on the platform so fun! Regardless, if I played it for the 1st time or 100th time. Offering significantly better aiming experiences in these titles than they originally ever had with a controller before. While not needing any aim assist. Including a lot of the older ones. Though, the newer shooters benefit just as much. I'd even argue it is more immersive and satisfying as well.\n\n \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), has be been no exception. Just thought I'd share one of the biggest reasons why I love my Steam Deck with the community. How much of a game changer this feature has been for me personally. People give Nintendo all the praise for gyro controls. However, it's my opinion, Valve, is leading the way with the Steam Deck and Steam Inputs. As they support the feature fully and keep it updated. Making sure people actually have consistent, quality, fundamental access to it. Offering quality experiences. Valve, seems to understand gyro aims value. Which is awesome! Something the other major gaming platforms are still very far behind in unfortunately. It's not even close. \n\nI love this thing! \n\n[Steam Deck] [Gyro Aim] [Tomb Raider 2013] [No Aim Assist]",

I have a beast of a PC, why would I need one? If I am going to be out and have extra time, I can just get some reading done instead of gaming.\n\nWell, now I am a mom and I figured I would treat myself to the OLED. My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby. Back to a time without all the responsibilities I carry now, I could have endlessly enjoyed the steam deck. I missed out on three years of being able to potato on the couch after a hard day at work. Before you weep for me, do not worry. I fully plan to own a steam deck for the rest of my life to make up for it.\n\nTL;DR: Buy a steam deck, and live a happy life.",

    "selftext": "Basically title. Been looking into handhelds lately, and really think I'm gonna get a Steam Deck. But..\n\nI figured the main appeal of a handheld gaming device is to play on the go, right? Granted, I haven't had a handheld since the DS Lite. However, I never travel. I basically go to work and home, and whenever I do go somewhere I'm the one driving. \n\nLately though, there's days where I get home from work and I'd like to play some games, but I just don't feel like sitting at my desk to play them (which is what first made the SD appealing). I also have quite the backlog on Steam, and I've heard the Deck is great for burning through your backlog. I'm also interested in getting into emulation of older/retro games, since I feel I missed out on a lot of them from not gaming much as a kid.\n\nSo basically, do you think the Steam Deck would be worth it for me?",

Right now whenever I move the computer directly to the PC and hol it up it's just a pain and nothing feels seamless. \n\nWhat are y'alls experience doing the same? \n\nIs this a good product for essentially a more open Nintendo switch with an emphasis on docked mode?

So, about a month ago, I caved. I saw one on Facebook, and someone was selling a brand new OLED model for $425 and I just had to get it. Ever since that day, I have been addicted. \n\nI take it almost everywhere I go, work, school, but mostly I‚Äôm sitting with my girlfriend on the couch or in bed and we are just doing our own things, and it is bliss. \n\nI‚Äôve been buying more indie games to play as it fits so well with the console, and I‚Äôve been catching up on games that I‚Äôve stopped playing.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still play games on my PC, but now it‚Äôs different; I actually WANT to play games again. There‚Äôs just something so nice about being able to play what I want no matter where I am. With the expansion of it being a computer too, I can emulate games or just tinker with my system, opening a whole new world of things I can do. \n\nSo, if you can, get a steam deck. It might just spark your love for gaming again. ",

    "selftext": "The biggest selling point for purchasing my Steam Deck was the promise of quality gyro aiming in any game I wanted through \"Steam Inputs\" that the device can reasonably support. The Deck, has not disappointed in that regard. It has made so many action shooters I've played on the platform so fun! Regardless, if I played it for the 1st time or 100th time. Offering significantly better aiming experiences in these titles than they originally ever had with a controller before. While not needing any aim assist. Including a lot of the older ones. Though, the newer shooters benefit just as much. I'd even argue it is more immersive and satisfying as well.\n\n \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), has be been no exception. Just thought I'd share one of the biggest reasons why I love my Steam Deck with the community. How much of a game changer this feature has been for me personally. People give Nintendo all the praise for gyro controls. However, it's my opinion, Valve, is leading the way with the Steam Deck and Steam Inputs. As they support the feature fully and keep it updated. Making sure people actually have consistent, quality, fundamental access to it. Offering quality experiences. Valve, seems to understand gyro aims value. Which is awesome! Something the other major gaming platforms are still very far behind in unfortunately. It's not even close. \n\nI love this thing! \n\n[Steam Deck] [Gyro Aim] [Tomb Raider 2013] [No Aim Assist]",

My reward for carrying and birthing a whole human. Gone are the days of stressful competitive online gaming. Absolutely loving all the cozy games right now, especially as the weather gets colder. The little pockets of time I have during the day to game? Invaluable. The longer sesh after a trying day? Sensational. \n\nI find myself reminiscing my life before my precious baby.

Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this?

I'm renting, and I don't want to invest in a house that isn't mine. I've been looking around and I've seen that Philips Hue might be the best option, but it seems a bit expensive, and I don't know if I'm just paying for the brand. I see the bridge as important, but other brands like Goove don't include it. I don't know if it can be purchased separately... I'm a bit lost. Can anyone with experience help me? P.S.: I'm only interested in light bulbs, not LEDs or lamps of any kind.",

    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

The app fails during the \"Connect to device\" step with the error: \"Connecting to network timed out - Bring phone closer to device and try again\"\nWhat I've already tried:\n\nPhone is literally inches away from the bulb during setup\nConnected to 2.4GHz network only (confirmed in router settings)\nWiFi password has no special characters\nReset the bulb multiple times (5+ power cycles until it blinks)\nReinstalled the Yeelight app\nTurned off mobile data and VPN\nRouter has strong signal where the bulb is located\nTried setup at different times of day\n\nMy setup:\n\nBulb model: Mi Smart LED Bulb Essential (White and Color) - Model: MJDPL01YL\nPhone: iPhone (iOS)\nRouter: 2.4GHz enabled, WPA2 security\nApp: Latest version from App Store\n\nHere's the weird part: I also have a Yeelight LED (YLDP02YL - the older color version) that I set up successfully with the same network, same phone, same app. That one connected without any issues. So I know my setup works in general, but this specific bulb just won't connect.\nThe bulb powers on fine and goes into pairing mode (blinking), but it times out every single time at the network connection step.\nHas anyone else dealt with this timeout error on the Essential model specifically? Any ideas why one bulb would work fine but the other won't? Thanks in advance for any help!",

The keypads are failing on two of them (they are all either under a roof or inside the house so not really exposed to the worst weather).

I'm trying to come up with a way to use a bluetooth (not wifi) thermometer/hygrometer and connect it to a pc (windows). I know a bunch of sensors use wifi or connect to an apple/android device with bluetooth, but these aren't options for my situation unfortunately.\n\nI am trying to monitor the temp and humidity in the specimen room of the lab where I work, and can't feed wires through the doors to connect the sensor to the laptop. The university doesn't want us to connect 3rd party sensors to their wifi (booooooo), and the laptop we have in the lab is windows (not a chromebook). \n\nWith all the funding cuts in the university, I'd like to keep the cost low (i.e. not purchase a chrome book for this). If possible, I'd also LOVE a way to set up a notification system to let myself and my boss know if the temperature breaks through a certain threshold.\n\nI think a zigbee setup could work, and I was just hoping someone here could explain this to me like im a 5 year old caveman child. If I get this usb stick and thermometer, as well as download the appropriate driver onto the laptop, will I have a functioning system to achieve my goal? or is there something I'm missing? i'd appreciate any guidance, i'm unfortunately a biologist that got stuck with broken computers!\n\nUSB STICK\n\n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOopgrnvysvOwmzWYxPMNBugtqpIH8ymfiwM61mNNefXF5j5wTHWlJN0)\n\nSENSOR  \n[https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-snzb-02d-zigbee-lcd-smart-temperature-humidity-sensor/)\n\nthank you all!",

So yeah if an AI Chef Assistant can save me a few hours a week, I‚Äôm all in.\n\nI‚Äôve been looking into a few of these AI sous chef tools like Samsung‚Äôs SmartThings Cooking, June Oven, and Brava‚Äôs smart light tech etcte. What really caught my attention though is Gambit Robotics AND mostly because it seems to focus on real-time guidance instead of just automation which allows me to just turn off my brain when i get home.\n\nI get that some people see this as cheating or lazy but honestly? For busy professionals, that‚Äôs the point. We don‚Äôt want to replace cooking we just want to make it less stressful. If tech can make homemade food easier to pull off after a 10-hour workday + I get to go to the gym, imagine the daily impact of that in the long run and tbhh that‚Äôs a win in my book",

The glue between the tape and the foam is just too weak.\n\nWhere would I get better working stickers? I could use generic double sided tape, but the stickers provide more tolerance due to their foam and tape to thin would not make good contact (the outer edge is slightly raised).

Right now, there‚Äôs an old intercom system that lets me talk to visitors and open the gate remotely from inside the house. The gate lock uses an electric strike (if that‚Äôs the right term).\n\nI‚Äôd like to replace the current system with a smart doorbell that has a camera and allows remote access (via app). Power is already available at the gate, and the electric strike works fine.\n\nMy idea was to install a mobile LTE/5G router at the gate to provide Wi-Fi there and then use a device like Ring or a similar system for the video doorbell.\n\nMy questions:\n\t‚Ä¢\tWould you approach this differently?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny recommendations for specific brands or systems?\n\t‚Ä¢\tCan a system like Ring, Nuki (or similar) actually control an electric strike, or would I need a different setup for that part?\n\t‚Ä¢\tIdeally, I‚Äôd like one provider for both the gate doorbell and a smart doorbell/lock at the main house door, to keep everything within one ecosystem, or do you think that having different systems does not make a huge difference?\n\nThanks a lot for any tips or setups that worked well for you!",

    "selftext": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI'd like to share my open-source project **Proxmox-GitOps**, a Container Automation platform for provisioning and orchestrating Linux containers (LXC) on Proxmox VE - encapsulated as comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\n**Proxmox-GitOps (@Github)**: [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps)\n¬†\n* **Demo** (~1m): [https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY](https://youtu.be/2oXDgbvFCWY)\n\n* **Demo** (low, no ads): [https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif](https://github.com/stevius10/Proxmox-GitOps/blob/develop/docs/demo.gif)\n\n\n**TL;DR**: By encapsulating infrastructure within an extensible monorepository - recursively resolved from Git submodules at runtime - Proxmox-GitOps provides a comprehensive Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) abstraction for an entire, automated, container-based infrastructure.\n\nOriginally, it was a personal attempt to bring industrial automation and cloud patterns to my Proxmox home server. It's designed as a platform architecture for a self-contained, bootstrappable system - a generic IaC abstraction (customize, extend, .. open standards, base package only, .. - you name it üòâ) that automates the entire infrastructure. It was initially driven by the question of what a Proxmox-based GitOps automation could look like and how it could be organized.\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Recursive Self-management**: Control plane seeds itself by pushing its monorepository onto a locally bootstrapped instance, triggering a pipeline that recursively provisions the control plane onto PVE.\n\n* **Monorepository**: Centralizes infrastructure as comprehensive IaC artifact (for mirroring, like the project itself on Github) using submodules for modular composition.\n\n* **Git as State**: Git repository represents the desired infrastructure state.\n\n* **Loose coupling**: Containers are decoupled from the control plane, enabling runtime replacement and independent operation.\n\nOver the past few months, the project stabilized, and I‚Äôve addressed many questions you had in Wiki, summarized to documentation, which should now covers essential technical, conceptual, and practical aspects. I‚Äôve also added a short demo that breaks down the theory by demonstrating the automation of an IaC stack (Home Assistant, Mosquitto bridge, Zigbee2MQTT broker, snapshot restore, reverse proxy, dynamically configured via PVE API), with automated container system updates and service checks.\n\n**What am I looking for?** It's a noncommercial, passion-driven project. I'm looking to collaborate with other engineers who share the excitement of building a self-contained, bootstrappable platform architecture that addresses the question: What should our home automation look like?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!",

    "selftext": "Last year, I installed a k-type thermocouple in my wood stove flue pipe. Coupled with an esp8266, it's let me keep track of stove temperatures and helped optimize burns (when to cut back primary air, when to reload, etc). As a result, last week when I cleaned the chimney for the season, I had virtually no creosote build up.  I had set up some simple notifications to our phones like over fire when temp > 800F and reload when temp < 250F, but it was a bit of a pain to pull my phone out throughout the night to keep tabs on the stove. Tonight, I mapped the temperature reading to a hue value on the hue/sat color wheel and setup an automation to gradually adjust a virtually unused wyze color bulb in the corner for a visual stove temperature indication. After burn #1 with it in place, I'm pretty satisfied! Blue = cold, green = target, red = hot. With the hue mapping, color gradually adjusts every 30s in small increments throughout the burn.\n\n  \nFull write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/smart-light-wood-stove-temperature-indication/)\n\nAnd original stove monitoring write up here: [https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/](https://houndhillhomestead.com/woodstove-temperature-monitoring/)",

So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all ‚Äî hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI‚Äôve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äî my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30√ó1.5?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss‚ÜíM30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you‚Äôve used?\n\nWhat I‚Äôve tried / extra info:\n\t‚Ä¢\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can‚Äôt figure out the chart :(",

So I know my setup works in general, but this specific bulb just won't connect.\nThe bulb powers on fine and goes into pairing mode (blinking), but it times out every single time at the network connection step.\nHas anyone else dealt with this timeout error on the Essential model specifically? Any ideas why one bulb would work fine but the other won't? Thanks in advance for any help!",

    "title": "[Showcase] My fully automated and accessible grow tent, powered by IFTTT, custom webhooks, and multiple sensor APIs.",
    "selftext": "\r\n(Hey everyone! I originally shared this project over on r/microgrowery... You can find the original post [here](LINK). I'm sharing the full story here as well because I thought you all would really appreciate the technical deep dive! üòä)\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nAfter a long time lurking, I wanted to stop by and share my grow project. It‚Äôs not because everything is perfect, but because I hope it might help or inspire others who are in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI am severely disabled and can no longer perform any physical tasks on my own. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt want to give up gardening‚Äîespecially the joy of growing. So, I developed a setup that is designed for complete accessibility and full automation.\n\nI know there are others out there who miss the joy of growing because of physical limitations ‚Äî this is for you.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n## The Goal:\r\n\r\nMy primary objective was to create a system where:\r\n- No manual watering or physical intervention is needed.\r\n- Everything is controlled and monitored automatically via my smartphone/tablet using MacroDroid, IFTTT, and various APIs.\r\n- I receive automatic alerts for any deviations.\r\n- The entire setup is remotely controllable, requiring no assistance for daily operations.\n\n---\n- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/pKG0RhD\r\n----\n\n\n ##  The Setup (for the Nerds):\r\n\r\n#### Grow:\r\n- Ansobea Grow Tent 100x100x200cm in the garage\r\n- 3 Autoflower plants\r\n- 3x 11L (approx. 3 gal) fabric pots\r\n\r\n#### Light & Climate:\r\n- Spider Farmer SF 1000 Samsung LM301H EVO LED\r\n- Cecotec Ready Warm 6350 (Heater)\r\n- Levoit Humidifier (with an automated refilling system)\r\n- Cecotec Big Dry 4000 Dehumidifier\r(Automatic condensate recycling into the humidifier‚Äôs water tank)\n- Eco-Exhaust System (125‚Äì250 m¬≥/h)\r\n- TronicXL Intake Fan\r(with a DIY air filter on it with some HEPA to keep all the dust and crap out of my fresh air)\n- Clip-on fan inside the tent\r\n\r\n#### Insulation:\r\n- Tent is fully insulated from the outside with Dripex foil.\r\n- Floor and ceiling are double-insulated.\r\n- K-Flex ST 10mm self-adhesive rubber insulation for all walls, floor, and ceiling to combat radiant heat from the garage being in use.\r\n\r\n#### Water & Irrigation:\r\n- 3x Royal Gardineer Wi-Fi Irrigation Systems\r\n- Controlled by 3x Fyta Beam sensors via MacroDroid & IFTTT\r\n- USB submersible pump to automatically refill the humidifier\r\n- 2x 12L buckets with lids as a freshwater reservoir\r\n- Nutrients & Water Source: To create a stable and automated feeding solution, I dissolve slow-release fertilizer tabs (Easy Grow & Easy Bloom) directly in the water reservoirs. This turns the plain rainwater into a consistent, mild nutrient solution that is delivered with every automated watering cycle, eliminating the need for complex liquid dosing systems.\n\r\n#### Smart Control & Monitoring:\r\n- Fyta Beam (3x): For substrate moisture levels.\r\n- Ubibot WS1: For ambient temperature and humidity.\r\n- MacroDroid: Running on an Android tablet as the main dashboard for control logic.\r\n- Google APIs: Using Calendar API for cycle tracking, Sheets API for data logging, and Gemini API for intelligent analysis.\r\n- Gemini AI Integration: The AI helps interpret sensor data (and eventually images) to give me quick insights. It can analyze climate trends or plant status and tell me via voice output if things look good, if there are signs of stress, or if something is missing. The goal is to get a fast assessment without having to puzzle over raw data.\r\n- During the crucial late flowering stage, the automated dehumidifier emptied itself over 200 times, maintaining a perfect environment to prevent bud rot ‚Äì all without me.\r\n- Over the entire grow cycle, the system logged over 1,500 data points for Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, which are automatically fed into a Google Sheet for analysis.\r\n- Litcom P1 Camera: For remote visual monitoring.\r\n- GL.iNet Router: Provides Wi-Fi in the tent with an LTE dongle as a fallback if the main internet goes down.\r\n- ECOFLOW Smart Plug: To monitor power consumption.\r\n- Power Source: 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery. Daily consumption ranges from 1.7 ‚Äì 4.2 kWh.\r\n\n---\r\n##  Manual Steps & Support:\r\n\n\nThe only manual steps are filling the pots with soil, planting the seeds, and refilling the water reservoirs for irrigation and the humidifier as needed. My wife and son help me with these tasks. A huge thank you to my son who handled all the technical assembly and wiring inside the tent for me!\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n ##  Why I‚Äôm Sharing This\r\n\r\nI know growing is often seen as a physically demanding hobby. I can no longer do the physical work, but I refused to give it up. With some planning, technology, and patience, it‚Äôs possible to manage a grow independently, even with my limitations. The system runs stable without anyone needing to intervene.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or are working on an accessible setup yourself, I‚Äôd love to connect!\r\n\r\nA quick personal note: I use a speech computer operated by a finger switch for all my communication. I‚Äôm really looking forward to your questions and will do my best to answer every single one. Please bear with me if my replies take a little longer than usual.\r\n\n\n---\r\n##  Future Plans:\r\n\n\n1.  Automated Light Lift: I‚Äôm planning a Wi-Fi-controlled lift for my SF 1000, which will use a sensor to check the light height and automatically adjust it based on the plant‚Äôs growth phase, controlled via MacroDroid and IFTTT.\r\n\n\n2.  Light Intensity Control: I want to integrate the GGS WiFi Controller from Spider Farmer to automate light intensity.\r\n\n\n3.  DIY CO2 System: A Wi-Fi-controlled CO2 system managed via the REST API of a Qingping CO2 monitor, which will also track temp/humidity and send alerts.\n\n\n4. Lighting tweak: Gonna mount 4x Secret Jardin Cosmorrow sticks (2x veg 20W + 2x bloom 20W) on the vertical tent poles. Plan is to switch them by phase so the lower canopy actually gets some love instead of sitting in the dark.\n\r\n---\r\r\n##  FAQ / Answering a Few Questions I Anticipate\r\n\r\nThis is to provide some context for why my system is built the way it is.\r\n\r\n1. ‚ÄûThis is completely over-engineered. Why so much tech?‚Äú\r\n-\tThe setup is designed for total accessibility. Since I can‚Äôt physically intervene, technology takes over the manual care. What a watering can is to others, an API is to me. It‚Äôs not overkill‚Äîit‚Äôs my independence.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n2. ‚ÄûThis must cost more than just buying. Why the effort?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou‚Äôre right, it does. This isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about self-determination. For me, growing is independence, participation, and a form of therapy. No dispensary can provide that.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n3. ‚ÄûIs it still ‚Äögrowing‚Äò if everything is automated?‚Äú\r\n-\tYes. Growing isn‚Äôt just manual labor‚Äîit‚Äôs responsibility, planning, and a love for the plant. Technology is just my tool. I garden differently, but with the same heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n4. ‚ÄûWhat happens if IFTTT, Google, or your sensors fail?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm already planning redundant solutions using Home Assistant, local control with an ESP32/MQTT, and a minimal offline interface. Fallbacks are a core part of the concept.\r\n\r\n---\r\n5. ‚ÄûWhy go public with something like this?‚Äú\r\n-\tBecause I want other people with disabilities to know: you are not excluded from this hobby. With technology, family, and good planning, it‚Äôs possible, even with severe limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n6. ‚ÄûWhy not a simpler setup without the cloud, Google, etc.?‚Äú\r\n-\tFor many, that‚Äôs a great option‚Äîbut not for me. I need remote control, notifications, and reliable sensor data precisely because I can‚Äôt reach into the tent. It‚Äôs not about convenience; it‚Äôs a necessity.\r\n\r\n---\r\r\n7. ‚ÄûDo you have any pictures of the build process itself?‚Äú\r\n-\tGreat question! To be honest, we were so focused on the technical side of things‚Äîthe automation, the code, and making it accessible‚Äîthat we completely forgot to take pictures of the physical tent assembly. The real ‚Äöbuild‚Äò for us was the digital ecosystem you see in the data screenshots. I‚Äôll be sure to document any future upgrades more thoroughly!\r\n---\r\r\n8. ‚ÄûHow do you manage the extreme climate swings in a garage? And isn‚Äôt the power draw a major issue?‚Äú\r\n-\tYou're right, garages are a real challenge. I tackled this with a two-part solution for maximum stability and reliability:\r\n-\tClimate Stability: The tent is heavily insulated with K-Flex rubber to buffer against outside temperature swings. Inside, the Ubibot sensors act as a constant watchdog. They triggered my automated heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier whenever needed via MacroDroid. For example, the dehumidifier ran over 200 automated cycles during late flower to prevent bud rot‚Äîa task I could never have managed manually.\r\n-\tPower & Reliability: The entire setup is powered entirely by the 7.1 kWp SolarEdge PV system with an 11 kWh battery located next to the house. The PV system supplies 100% of the power needed for the tent (1.7‚Äì4.2 kWh per day), making it completely self-sufficient and independent from the grid. A dedicated router with an LTE dongle ensures reliable data connectivity, providing a robust fallback so that automation never loses its connection. This level of redundancy is essential, because for me, a power outage isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîit could mean losing an entire crop.\r\n\n\r\n##  Conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhat might look like ‚Äûoverkill‚Äú to some is a piece of my independence and quality of life. This setup doesn‚Äôt replace my involvement‚Äîit‚Äôs what makes my involvement possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.\r\n\n\n---\r\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm severely disabled, so I built a fully automated grow tent I can control from my tablet/phone. It uses sensors, APIs (including AI for analysis), and smart plugs to handle everything from watering to climate. This isn‚Äôt about being lazy; it‚Äôs about regaining my independence and a beloved hobby.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Help identifying Danfoss radiator valve types + correct adapters for tado X (Denmark, district heating)",
    "selftext": "Hi all ‚Äî hoping for some EU/DK-specific guidance.\n\nI‚Äôve just bought tado X smart radiator thermostats that I want to integrate with Homey. The plan is per-room temperature sensors and routines in Homey. The home is in Denmark with district heating (two-pipe with return). Hydraulics/control won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äî my snag is mechanical fitment.\n\nThe problem:\nI have multiple radiators with different valve bodies. Most currently have non-smart Danfoss heads. I attached photos of each valve with the old heads removed and a ruler for scale. None of the adapters included with my tado X kit seem to fit these valves.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\t1.\tValve ID: Based on the photos, can you help me identify which Danfoss valve families I have (RA-N / RA-2000 / RAW vs older RAV / RAVL, etc.)?\n\t2.\tCorrect adapters: Which exact adapters do I need to mount tado X on these valves?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor Danfoss RA types, do I need the RA clamp adapter that converts to M30√ó1.5?\n\t‚Ä¢\tFor RAV or RAVL, do I need the specific RAV/RAVL adapter with the pin extender?\n\t3.\ttado X compatibility: Are the usual Danfoss adapters for older tado heads still the right ones for tado X, or do I need a different SKU?\n\t4.\tWhere to buy (EU/DK): Any reliable sources/links for the correct Danfoss‚ÜíM30 adapters in Denmark or EU that you‚Äôve used?\n\nWhat I‚Äôve tried / extra info:\n\t‚Ä¢\tRemoved the old Danfoss heads and looked for markings; not all are clearly labeled. Some radiators appear to have different valve bodies in the same house (yay‚Ä¶).\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe adapters included with the tado X kit (the generic M30 and a couple of plastic collars) don‚Äôt seat correctly on several valves.\n\t‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm fine ordering proper Danfoss-specific adapters (RA, RAV, RAVL), I just want to be sure I get the right ones the first time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDistrict heating with return flow is common here; this is purely about mechanical compatibility, not control strategy.\n\nPhotos attached:\n\t‚Ä¢\tClose-ups of each bare valve body (no head), from the side and front\n\t‚Ä¢\tA photo with caliper/ruler across the thread/collar\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny visible stamped codes/letters on the brass body\n\nBonus tips welcome:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow to tell RAV vs RAVL at a glance (collar diameter/shape, internal pin height, etc.)\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny gotchas with tado X + Danfoss (e.g., needing a pin extender or not overtightening the RA clamp)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf someone in DK has done this recently: which adapter part numbers worked for you?\n\nThanks a lot! Once I get the right adapters, I can sort the logic in Homey ‚Äî I just need these tado X heads to physically fit the Danfoss valves first. üôè\n\nTL:DR - what adapter can I buy for this? Can‚Äôt figure out the chart :(",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

Why not use presence or motion sensors? 3 rambunctious \"can go any and everywhere cats\". So far, I do use a combination of these set up strategically but the cats manage to trigger the lights even on *\"pet friendly\"* motion sensors at random times of night/morning. It's not a huge deal as all my lights are LED but I'd just rather it not happen.  \n\nI got to thinking, Amazon Alexa does have the option for some cameras to trigger a routine based on object, ie: person detection on some cameras. Of all the cameras I own; Blink, Eufy, Google, Reolink, Smartthings and Wyze, the Samsung and Wyze ones show the person detection setting in Alexa. The problem is that on Samsung, nothing happens, even though I've tried the setup directly inside Smartthings as well as Alexa and on Wyze, it takes like 1 to 2 minutes for the action to trigger after the detection occurs, rendering it pretty much useless. I don't have a Blink or Google sub to try for person detection on those (they only come with their subs) so under Alexa, I don't see a person detection option under those cameras. I don't know if that changes with a sub or not, I'm just saying.\n\nI was hoping I'd find someone here who'd successfully done this and could tell me what camera they are using.   \n  \nAlso, I'm not limited to Alexa. I have Google Home, Apple Home (Homekit), Smarlife/Tuya and Smartthings as well. I'm considering building a Home Assistant box, just lazy and daunted by the idea of moving everything over to it and all the extra that has to be done to get that all working. I don't mind working with separate systems if it \"just works\".\n\nThanks!",

There is occasional mail theft in my area, so it's helpful to know when mail is here so I can get it right away.\n\nI can't use a standard contact sensor because it's not a normal tube-style US mailbox. It is an enclosed box with a flap on the front top half and a locking door on the front bottom half. It's basically like this one: [https://gainesmfg.com/products/classic-pedestal-mailbox](https://gainesmfg.com/products/classic-pedestal-mailbox)\n\nMy solution was to use a wired contact sensor inside to trigger on the flap opening, with the wires snaking out the bottom and a smart sensor that supports dry contacts (external sensor) mounted underneath so the signal will work.\n\nI had previously used an Ecolink Door/Window sensor, and then the Aeotec Door/Window Sensor 7 Pro when the Ecolink failed. Unfortunately, after a few years, the Aeotec has now died and it's discontinued.\n\nSo, does anyone know a good smart sensor with the following features?\n\n* Battery powered\n* Z-Wave or Zigbee (no WiFi or BT)\n* Supports connecting an external sensor\n* Preferably resistant to the weather\n* US $50 or less if possible\n* No more than about 1/2in (1.3cm) on one dimension so I can mount it\n\nI'm located in the US, so I'd like to use a US-based seller so I don't need to navigate the whole import mess currently going on.",

I saw that the company shut down or something like that. I have zero interest in any complicated set ups to make it work again so I'm looking to replace them. What are some good budget replacements? Something bright but it doesn't have to be crazy. RGB isn't necessary but I did enjoy switching to red lights whenever I felt overstimulated. „Ö§Need 4. \n\nI loved the simple operation of the Sengled bulbs being controlled from my phone with Google Assistant or through the app. \n\n2. Currently using 2 Ring doorbells to monitor the doors at the front of my house. The main issue is that we're tired of paying the subscription. And then it just seems so laggy now. Sometimes we get notifications 30 minutes after and most of it the time it takes ages to connect to it from our phones to see what the notification is. I wanna say it's the wifi but we have pretty decent wifi.\n\nWhat affordable alternatives would you recommend for a doorbell type set up? Something without a subscription.\n\n  \nAdded request - We're using a really old camera system. I don't even know what the brand is but we have 9 wired cameras around the house that just aren't that great and then the app is even worse. Any recommendations here would be awesome. I know we can't cheap out on this one so I'm not looking for affordable here(just not ridiculous). Also something without a subscription. I don't live in the US and spending USD adds up really quick with forex limits.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nPS.

The Black is permanent live to the boiler for hot water.\n\nThe second picture is using WAGO connecters instead of the standard connector, hot water works fine.\n\nThe third picture shows how the relay is wired (there's a piece that plugs in to connect and control). My assumption was that I could just swap that Live/Neutral on the left to the inputs on the ZBMINIR2, and then the Live/Neutral on the right to the outputs, and everything should work.\n\nWith just the inputs, the ZBMINIR2 'works' fine, in that I can see it and toggle it in HomeAssistant. However the issue is that whenever I power the boiler on with the outputs connected, my RCD trips instantly.\n\n  \nHoping for some advice on what I'm doing wrong, because I am perplexed.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nWe currently control almost all our lights through Google Home using voice commands and the Google Home app. Each room has several ‚Äúdumb‚Äù lamps connected to SiGN Smart Home Wi-Fi Smart Plugs (Tuya/Smart Life based).\n\nIn Google Home, I‚Äôve grouped multiple smart plugs into routines, for example, saying ‚ÄúTurn off the bedroom‚Äù or tapping the routine in the Google Home app turns off all plugs in that room.\n\nNow my wife doesn‚Äôt like talking to Google üòÖ, so I‚Äôm trying to find a way to add physical buttons that can trigger these existing Google Home routines or groups without adding a new hub, ideally, Wi-Fi buttons that can directly trigger the same actions we already have in Google Home.\n\nIs there any simple, reliable way to do this? Either by linking a smart button to existing Google Home routines, or faking a voice command through a button press?\n\nAny tips or product recommendations (that work well in Europe/Sweden) are much appreciated!",

For example, here is what it gives over the cheapest\n\nBuilt-in radar occupancy sensor - What? No I don't care\n\t\nBuilt-in indoor air quality monitor - To do what with? It's not suddenly gonna grow a filter it didn't have before. And frequent reports of it lying about air quality.\n\t\nSmartSensor included in the box - Cool idea, but under the SmartSensor page it seems to do nothing unless you pay them a monthly subscription, which I'm not going to do\n\t\nChoice of Siri‚Ä† or Alexa Built-in - What? Why? no\n\t\nSpotify & Bluetooth streaming - On my thermostat? Why?\n\n\nAm I wrong about any of this? Is there any actual useful advantage with getting the high end model that doesn't involve paying a subscription.",

We would absolutely love to get these set up into our smart home system (Alexa currently, Home Assistant likely in the future) so that they can go up and down on a timer throughout the day. I've been trying to find a motorized retrofit system for them but haven't had any luck. I've found sets that will tilt horizontal blinds (these blinds don't have the twist rod), and others that will open curtains by running a motor across the top pole, but I can't seem to find any that are set up to pull the cords to open a standard set of blinds. If anybody happens to know if these exist and could let me know I would really appreciate it!",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

A switch like that would have to have a very specific \"on\" time. Like, I should be able to tell it how long it takes to extend fully and program that time in seconds.\n\n  \nIs there any product that works well and integrates with the typical smart home hubs that would work? Right now, we have and really like Hue hub for our exterior lights and a way to hook this up to Hue would be awesome. What I'd like to avoid is another Wi-Fi-based switch with a proprietary app. I am pretty handy, but a plug-and-play switch is really all I'm willing to invest in for this project.",

Maybe zigbee for all the other items too and Sonos for the sound. My question was in using this set up I believe using the Somfy TaHoma I can control all together on their app, but is there any other hub solution I can use to control all together and via home kit too?

For example, here is what it gives over the cheapest\n\nBuilt-in radar occupancy sensor - What? No I don't care\n\t\nBuilt-in indoor air quality monitor - To do what with? It's not suddenly gonna grow a filter it didn't have before. And frequent reports of it lying about air quality.\n\t\nSmartSensor included in the box - Cool idea, but under the SmartSensor page it seems to do nothing unless you pay them a monthly subscription, which I'm not going to do\n\t\nChoice of Siri‚Ä† or Alexa Built-in - What? Why? no\n\t\nSpotify & Bluetooth streaming - On my thermostat? Why?\n\n\nAm I wrong about any of this?

We would absolutely love to get these set up into our smart home system (Alexa currently, Home Assistant likely in the future) so that they can go up and down on a timer throughout the day. I've been trying to find a motorized retrofit system for them but haven't had any luck. I've found sets that will tilt horizontal blinds (these blinds don't have the twist rod), and others that will open curtains by running a motor across the top pole, but I can't seem to find any that are set up to pull the cords to open a standard set of blinds. If anybody happens to know if these exist and could let me know I would really appreciate it!",

    "selftext": "I recently got a Bosch Air 2000i air purifier that should feature a WiFi functionality. However, when turning on the device, there is no WiFi icon on the interface, despite the manual claiming there should be.\n\nDoes one need to have the Bosch HomeCom app configured all the way including an account set up in order to have the WiFi icon appear on the device? If yes, that would be odd, because the manual explicitly states to \"Make sure the wireless indicator on the interface is blinking.\" as the second step right after connecting the power cord and turning it on - configuring the HomeCom app comes later in this list.\n\nAlso, there isn't any word neither in the manual nor online about what to do if the WiFi icon is not shown, if there is some way to make the device scan for wireless networks.\n\nSo I am wondering if the device might have a technical fault. After learning by starting the HomeCom app that one needs to set up just another online account to use the WiFi functionality, the latter has lost much of its appeal to me, so I might as well use the Air 2000 without the \"i\". But if the missing WiFi symbol is normal and doesn't indicate a fault, I might as well keep it because the core functionality works just fine.\n\nDoes anyone of you own this device and have an idea if my particular device may be faulty?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

I switched the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and alt 8.8.4.4 and changed some of the network adapter settings like power saving and it worked to fix that issue. However, today, my PC stopped being able to get any internet speed over 100mbps. \n\nThings I did: \nChecked ISP side issues, nothing. Every other device in the house getting normal speeds but still reset it multiple times to no avail. Bought a new ethernet cable since it‚Äôs hardwired, same issue. Swapped ethernet cables with my wife‚Äôs computer which i tested right before at 900mbps up and down, but when plugged into my computer still stuck at 100. Unplugged ethernet, uninstalled drivers, reinstalled ethernet drivers from realtek and plugged into again, same issue. Every known ipconfig and netsh command under the sun, same issue remains. Plugged in the wifi antenna since my motherboard is a B850 GAMING PLUS WIFI PZ, same throttled speed with wifi as well. Got a usb-c to ethernet adapter and plugged into that instead in case my NIC on the mobo was defective, same issue. \n\n\nEnded up having to do a fresh install of Windows 11 wiping everything on my PC because every good search or reddit post I searched I exhausted all options. What did I miss or how do I fix this in the future without wiping everything and having to redownload everything? \n",

Here is a post I made on the cloudflare support site for some questions that I've already been asked (tl;dr from that is the issue is specific to Firefox when not in private browsing): [https://community.cloudflare.com/t/unable-to-complete-any-cloudflare-turnstile/843133/2](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/unable-to-complete-any-cloudflare-turnstile/843133/2) (The person that was replying to me closed the topic, even though they did not provide a solution to it. This is why I'm posting here, now.) (That post has a confusing layout, at least for me, you have to scroll down and it makes more sense.)\n\nPretty much, the issue is, any Cloudflare turnstile does not let me through.\n\nI'm completely clueless as to what is the issue here. Just now my search engine, Startpage, temporarily blocked me as well. I don't know why the internet is convinced I'm a bot.\n\nI went to this [Google Recaptcha demo](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo), and it verified without issue. Not sure if that helps.

    "selftext": "I just built a new PC, R5 9600X, RX 9070, 32GB of RAM. It was running great, well over 200 fps on Borderlands 3 which I've been playing the most of recently. Now today I am getting horrible stuttering and framerate issues. My temps were fine, \\~70 on the CPU and 60 on the GPU. While I was looking at Task Manager while playing, I didn't notice any other program eating up a ton of CPU usage, and the CPU was still capping out.\n\nI ran PassMark and got horrible results on my RAM and CPU, which again makes me think it is primarily a CPU issue. [Here](https://www.passmark.com/baselines/V11/display.php?id=299242813379) is a link to my results. I am not super familiar with PassMark, so I hope I'm not doxing myself there haha. \n\nWhat confuses me the most is why this just happened overnight. I didn't change or install any apps. All I've done on my computer since I last played with no issues was do some work in Excel and a pdf reader, and changed one of my other monitors to 100Hz from 59.94 (I tried switching it back, did not help). I have also tried restarting my computer.\n\nI would appreciate anybody's thoughts on what the issue could be. Thank you all in advance :)",

I contacted the help desk today and was able to get my mac address registered manually (instead of needing to prompt the usual login website -which i also couldn‚Äôt get to show up) but everything still runs very slow.

Every other device (my phone, laptop, roommates things) have no trouble connecting to the wifi from my dorm and can also consistently hold strong connections, the issue seems to just be my desktop. I know my PC can at least connect to my phone‚Äôs hotspot if that is of any of help. \n\nUPDATE: My laptop is now having trouble as well, this might just be a problem with our room and the school network.

    "title": "Gaming PC Severely Underperforming",
    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have a PC that is very clearly not performing as well as it should. When I play games with my friends who have less powerful PCs, they always get much better performance than I do. I have run HWMonitor and PassMark Performance Test to try and figure out the issue and no such luck. I thought perhaps I was having a thermal issue but I re-seated and re-pasted my CPU and no performance improvement has occurred. I also tried reformatting my PC but the issue persists. I have the latest graphics driver installed and I keep my display at 1080p.\n\nMy PC Specs:  \nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ti  \nCPU - Intel Core i7 10700K  \nMotherboard - ASUS TUF Gaming Z490-Plus  \nRAM - Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x32 GB DDR4 3000  \nSSD - Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 2TB  \nPower Supply - Seasonic FOCUS Plus 850 Platinum\n\nThe PassMark Rating was as follows:  \nPASSMARK: 5711.3 (63rd Percentile)  \nCPU MARK: 14045.0 (53rd Percentile)  \n2D MARK: 188.4 (13th Percentile)  \n3D MARK: 9656.7 (53rd Percentile)  \nMEMORY MARK: 2444.0 (38th Percentile)  \nDISK MARK: 20275.5 (71st Percentile)\n\nWhile running the PassMark test my CPU max temperature was 83 celcius and my GPU max temperature was 60 celcius according to HWMonitor.  CPU Max Power was 196W, GPU Max Power was 342W, which I believe seems rather normal.\n\nAs a frame of reference, this weekend I played the Arc Raiders playtest with a friend of mine who has an RTX 3060 Ti and an Intel i7 8700K. Even though he clearly has a weaker GPU and CPU, he was averaging 70-75 fps while I was averaging 40-45 fps at the exact same graphics settings. Similar performance occurs in other games we play together as well. Often times, changing graphics quality settings has very little effect on FPS even when changing from the highest to lowest graphics presets, leading me to suspect it isn't a GPU issue.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! I'm completely dumbfounded and frustrated over this. Could it just be that I have a faulty CPU? Thanks!",

    "selftext": "I recently bought a used desktop gaming pc from ebay an hp omen 25l. The hard drive in it never shows up in disk management, file explorer or any partition wizard tool. It is not an issue related to the drive letter being not assigned since disk management doesn't show it at all as if the hard drive never even exists! It only shows up the ssd where windows is installed. Of course it doesn't show up in the file explorer as well. And it doesn't even show up in command prompt with diskpart list disk command, only the ssd shows there. Weirdly, crystaldiskinfo does detect the hard drive and reports its health as \"good\". Also in the system properties in storage, it shows the total storage of the system to be 1.14 tb which is only possible by combining the space of 256gb ssd(where windows is installed) and 1tb hdd(that's not being detected). So the OS does detect the hdd to some level as it takes into account the capacity of hdd while reporting the total storage. Now I'm 100% sure the issue is not the sata cable and sata port because i plugged in this hdd in my old pc and its behavior is exactly the same. The old pc had a perfectly working hdd in it and I simply replaced that working hdd with this one with the same sata cable and port that worked fine with the other hdd. So what's going on here?",

    "selftext": "So yesterday I was trying to boot into¬†**Safe Mode**¬†on my Windows 11 PC, but for some reason every time I entered¬†**WinRE**, my keyboard and mouse wouldn‚Äôt work ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt navigate at all.\n\nI looked it up on Reddit and found out this is a¬†**known issue caused by a recent Windows update**. Another user who was having the same problem said to try running this command:\n\nbcdedit /set {globalsettings} advancedoptions true\n\nI tried it, but it didn‚Äôt do anything. So I followed another guide that told me to use these commands:\n\nbcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot\n\nbcdedit /deletevalue {default} bootmenupolicy\n\nbcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy standard\n\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu no\n\nbcdedit /timeout 0\n\nbcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled Yes\n\nbcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures\n\nAfter running all that, I restarted my PC and got a¬†**black screen with numbered boot options**, including one for Safe Mode. That actually worked ‚Äî I got into Safe Mode, then restarted again to return to normal Windows.\n\nBut then a new issue appeared:¬†**every time I start or restart my PC, that same black boot options screen pops up**, and I have to manually choose the normal Windows option every single time.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt find anything online to fix it, so I (regretfully üòÖ) asked ChatGPT for help. Here‚Äôs what it told me to do:\n\nFirst, it said to run:\n\nbcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy standard\n\nThat changed the black screen into a¬†**blue screen**¬†with similar options, which still appears every time I turn on my PC.\n\nThen it told me to run:\n\nbcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy standard\n\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu no\n\nbcdedit /timeout 0\n\n‚Äî did nothing.\n\nThen it said to run these again:\n\nbcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot\n\nbcdedit /deletevalue {default} bootmenupolicy\n\nbcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy standard\n\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu no\n\nbcdedit /timeout 0\n\nbcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled Yes\n\nbcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures\n\nStill didn‚Äôt fix it.\n\nAnd finally, it suggested:\n\nbcdedit /deletevalue {current} bootmenupolicy\n\nbcdedit /set {current} bootmenupolicy standard\n\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu no\n\nbcdedit /timeout 0\n\nbcdedit /set {current} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures\n\nbcdedit /set {current} recoveryenabled No\n\nNo luck either.\n\nSo now¬†**every time I turn on my PC, I still get that boot options screen**, and I have to manually select Windows to start it up.\n\nDoes anyone know how to completely disable that screen or reset whatever I messed up with bcdedit\n\n\n\n  \n",

I then downloaded the driver via the realtek site, it installed successfully but said it didn't find the device.\n\n\n\nI also don't see anything in the device manager, no unknown device or anything.\n\n\n\nI have a legion 5 16IRX9 laptop with Windows 11.",

Game started to lag massively (FPS drop from 100+ to 10) even when idling. this wasn't an issue a couple days ago. I then noticed that the GPU was throttling due to Power limit and Temperature limit. I logged datas with GPU-Z and have added the raw file here. It seems to reach Power limit first (flag 1) then Temperature limit (flag 2) most of the time (shows 3 because both flag are raised). It's surprising, because the TDP is 50W. The GPU consumption (W) never reaches that number. Also, the temperature limit is 75¬∞C and, while the GPU hot spot reaches that temperature several time, it doesn't always throttle. It also sometimes throttle before 75¬∞C, which adds to my confusion.\n\nWould anyone be able to confirm that this is 100% a thermal issue and not a power limit issue?\n\nThe GPU is throttling even when idling on a single player world optimized with the mod Sodium. I'm not using shaders or anything too crazy. It really seems like a GPU issue. CPU overclocking has been disabled years ago because of temperature issues, if that info could be valuable. My next step would probably be to repaste it, but I kind of want to get everyone's opinion on my problem before. I repasted it \\~2 years ago. Any other recommendation is well welcomed\n\nGPU info + TDP + Power limit:¬†[https://imgur.com/a/gpu-info-tdp-temperature-limit-jjkprCo](https://imgur.com/a/gpu-info-tdp-temperature-limit-jjkprCo)\n\nGPU-Z log file:¬†[https://pastebin.com/xuq9CVYx](https://pastebin.com/xuq9CVYx)\n\n*edit: typo",

    "selftext": "Hey y'all.\n\nYesterday, my son unplugged an re-plugged his freshly built Gaming PC (Mainboard: ASUS B650E-F Gaming Wifi) from all cables to get it out of the way for table space extension (building a larger wooden board to it). Before this, everything was fine. \n\nWhen he reconnected it, the wired Network connection didn't work anymore. No activity on the status lights, the Network is listed in windows as if there were no cable connected.\n\nI tried... \n\n* the same cable on another machine and it works just fine\n* reinstalling the driver\n* disabling / reenabling the device and the connection\n* windows troubleshooting, it just states \"no cable connected\"\n\nDuring boot, so before windows starts, the network port's green indicator is lighting up a few times. As soon as windows services are starting up, it stops. I also asked my son whether he used much force on the cable or heard any crunchy sounds that might indicate contacts breaking, but...guess - of course not :-D\n\n  \nTomorrow, I will boot up a linux live stick on the system to check what it's doing there. Any ideas what may be the cause of this or what to do about it? Any help is dearly appreciated. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have a PC that is very clearly not performing as well as it should. When I play games with my friends who have less powerful PCs, they always get much better performance than I do. I have run HWMonitor and PassMark Performance Test to try and figure out the issue and no such luck. I thought perhaps I was having a thermal issue but I re-seated and re-pasted my CPU and no performance improvement has occurred. I also tried reformatting my PC but the issue persists. I have the latest graphics driver installed and I keep my display at 1080p.\n\nMy PC Specs:  \nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ti  \nCPU - Intel Core i7 10700K  \nMotherboard - ASUS TUF Gaming Z490-Plus  \nRAM - Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x32 GB DDR4 3000  \nSSD - Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 2TB  \nPower Supply - Seasonic FOCUS Plus 850 Platinum\n\nThe PassMark Rating was as follows:  \nPASSMARK: 5711.3 (63rd Percentile)  \nCPU MARK: 14045.0 (53rd Percentile)  \n2D MARK: 188.4 (13th Percentile)  \n3D MARK: 9656.7 (53rd Percentile)  \nMEMORY MARK: 2444.0 (38th Percentile)  \nDISK MARK: 20275.5 (71st Percentile)\n\nWhile running the PassMark test my CPU max temperature was 83 celcius and my GPU max temperature was 60 celcius according to HWMonitor.  CPU Max Power was 196W, GPU Max Power was 342W, which I believe seems rather normal.\n\nAs a frame of reference, this weekend I played the Arc Raiders playtest with a friend of mine who has an RTX 3060 Ti and an Intel i7 8700K. Even though he clearly has a weaker GPU and CPU, he was averaging 70-75 fps while I was averaging 40-45 fps at the exact same graphics settings. Similar performance occurs in other games we play together as well. Often times, changing graphics quality settings has very little effect on FPS even when changing from the highest to lowest graphics presets, leading me to suspect it isn't a GPU issue.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! I'm completely dumbfounded and frustrated over this. Could it just be that I have a faulty CPU? Thanks!",

Now today I am getting horrible stuttering and framerate issues. My temps were fine, \\~70 on the CPU and 60 on the GPU. While I was looking at Task Manager while playing, I didn't notice any other program eating up a ton of CPU usage, and the CPU was still capping out.\n\nI ran PassMark and got horrible results on my RAM and CPU, which again makes me think it is primarily a CPU issue. [Here](https://www.passmark.com/baselines/V11/display.php?id=299242813379) is a link to my results. I am not super familiar with PassMark, so I hope I'm not doxing myself there haha. \n\nWhat confuses me the most is why this just happened overnight. I didn't change or install any apps. All I've done on my computer since I last played with no issues was do some work in Excel and a pdf reader, and changed one of my other monitors to 100Hz from 59.94 (I tried switching it back, did not help). I have also tried restarting my computer.\n\nI would appreciate anybody's thoughts on what the issue could be. Thank you all in advance :)",

    "title": "Hard drive is detected by crystaldiskinfo but no where else. Is it a failed drive?",
    "selftext": "I recently bought a used desktop gaming pc from ebay an hp omen 25l. The hard drive in it never shows up in disk management, file explorer or any partition wizard tool. It is not an issue related to the drive letter being not assigned since disk management doesn't show it at all as if the hard drive never even exists! It only shows up the ssd where windows is installed. Of course it doesn't show up in the file explorer as well. And it doesn't even show up in command prompt with diskpart list disk command, only the ssd shows there. Weirdly, crystaldiskinfo does detect the hard drive and reports its health as \"good\". Also in the system properties in storage, it shows the total storage of the system to be 1.14 tb which is only possible by combining the space of 256gb ssd(where windows is installed) and 1tb hdd(that's not being detected). So the OS does detect the hdd to some level as it takes into account the capacity of hdd while reporting the total storage. Now I'm 100% sure the issue is not the sata cable and sata port because i plugged in this hdd in my old pc and its behavior is exactly the same. The old pc had a perfectly working hdd in it and I simply replaced that working hdd with this one with the same sata cable and port that worked fine with the other hdd. So what's going on here?",

When I play games with my friends who have less powerful PCs, they always get much better performance than I do. I have run HWMonitor and PassMark Performance Test to try and figure out the issue and no such luck. I thought perhaps I was having a thermal issue but I re-seated and re-pasted my CPU and no performance improvement has occurred. I also tried reformatting my PC but the issue persists. I have the latest graphics driver installed and I keep my display at 1080p.\n\nMy PC Specs:  \nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ti  \nCPU - Intel Core i7 10700K  \nMotherboard - ASUS TUF Gaming Z490-Plus  \nRAM - Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x32 GB DDR4 3000  \nSSD - Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 2TB  \nPower Supply - Seasonic FOCUS Plus 850 Platinum\n\nThe PassMark Rating was as follows:  \nPASSMARK: 5711.3 (63rd Percentile)  \nCPU MARK: 14045.0 (53rd Percentile)  \n2D MARK: 188.4 (13th Percentile)  \n3D MARK: 9656.7 (53rd Percentile)  \nMEMORY MARK: 2444.0 (38th Percentile)  \nDISK MARK: 20275.5 (71st Percentile)\n\nWhile running the PassMark test my CPU max temperature was 83 celcius and my GPU max temperature was 60 celcius according to HWMonitor.  CPU Max Power was 196W, GPU Max Power was 342W, which I believe seems rather normal.\n\nAs a frame of reference, this weekend I played the Arc Raiders playtest with a friend of mine who has an RTX 3060 Ti and an Intel i7 8700K. Even though he clearly has a weaker GPU and CPU, he was averaging 70-75 fps while I was averaging 40-45 fps at the exact same graphics settings. Similar performance occurs in other games we play together as well. Often times, changing graphics quality settings has very little effect on FPS even when changing from the highest to lowest graphics presets, leading me to suspect it isn't a GPU issue.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! I'm completely dumbfounded and frustrated over this. Could it just be that I have a faulty CPU? Thanks!",

However, today, my PC stopped being able to get any internet speed over 100mbps. \n\nThings I did: \nChecked ISP side issues, nothing. Every other device in the house getting normal speeds but still reset it multiple times to no avail. Bought a new ethernet cable since it‚Äôs hardwired, same issue. Swapped ethernet cables with my wife‚Äôs computer which i tested right before at 900mbps up and down, but when plugged into my computer still stuck at 100. Unplugged ethernet, uninstalled drivers, reinstalled ethernet drivers from realtek and plugged into again, same issue. Every known ipconfig and netsh command under the sun, same issue remains. Plugged in the wifi antenna since my motherboard is a B850 GAMING PLUS WIFI PZ, same throttled speed with wifi as well. Got a usb-c to ethernet adapter and plugged into that instead in case my NIC on the mobo was defective, same issue. \n\n\nEnded up having to do a fresh install of Windows 11 wiping everything on my PC because every good search or reddit post I searched I exhausted all options. What did I miss or how do I fix this in the future without wiping everything and having to redownload everything? \n",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\nI‚Äôm a high school student focusing on IT as an occupational concentration. I‚Äôm helping our new electricity teacher set up his Dell desktop computer, but it‚Äôs acting strangely.\n\nWhen I try to download updates, it starts normally but crashes within a few minutes (sometimes seconds). Strange part is that it‚Äôs not a BSOD, instead, a blue window briefly appears at the lower-left corner (possibly part of the GUI), and then the entire screen goes black.\n\nWhen I open System Management, it also crashes within seconds. Occasionally, it even crashes without me doing anything ‚Äî just a black screen with a blue square at the lower left with no response. Sometimes just a black screen. \n\nThe computer hasn‚Äôt been used for several months.\n\nQuestions:\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhat could be causing this kind of crash?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAre there steps I can take to troubleshoot or fix it?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAny general IT troubleshooting advice for this type of problem?\n",

    "selftext": "Starting from last week of 10/13 my monitor has been getting a black screen where nothing would show up but things work fine such as audio is playing perfectly fine from Spotify/ youtube. I had double checked my my Display driver and it updated, Im not sure what is causing it as Event viewer doesnt tell me the issue or what causes it. In addition my fan is running fan running smoothly, could it be something with my psu or something with Display port since thats the only thing connected to my monitor?",
